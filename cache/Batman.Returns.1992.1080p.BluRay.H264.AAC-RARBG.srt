1
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,794
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

2
00:05:43,334 --> 00:05:45,704
Penguin sighting! Man or myth?

3
00:05:45,924 --> 00:05:49,084
What is he? Today's edition.
Another penguin sighting.

4
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:51,844
Another penguin sighting! Check it out!

5
00:05:52,014 --> 00:05:56,594
Penguin man living in Gotham's sewers!
Read all about the latest sighting!

6
00:06:01,524 --> 00:06:03,924
May I have your attention, Gotham City?

7
00:06:04,194 --> 00:06:07,314
It is time for tonight's lighting of the tree.

8
00:06:12,074 --> 00:06:13,564
How about that?

9
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:32,794
Part man, part penguin! All horrifying!

10
00:06:33,564 --> 00:06:36,264
Find out for only 50 cents! Come on!

11
00:06:36,734 --> 00:06:40,804
Read about the possible terror
beneath our feet! Check it out!

12
00:06:41,064 --> 00:06:42,564
Read about it!

13
00:06:45,194 --> 00:06:47,354
Missing link between man and bird.

14
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:48,774
My dear boy...

15
00:06:48,954 --> 00:06:51,904
...sometimes it's a diversion
to read such rubbish.

16
00:06:52,084 --> 00:06:54,244
Usually, it's a waste of time.

17
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,864
Whatever. Today's issue!
"The Penguin: Man or myth?"

18
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:01,334
The Globe! Right here! 25 cents!

19
00:07:25,954 --> 00:07:27,614
Well, here's hoping.

20
00:07:27,794 --> 00:07:31,484
With luck, Gotham will have its first
merry Christmas in years.

21
00:07:31,664 --> 00:07:34,234
I feel almost vulgar at Yuletide...

22
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:36,834
...mentioning the new power plant.

23
00:07:37,004 --> 00:07:40,784
But if we're to break ground
when we must, I'll need permits...

24
00:07:41,134 --> 00:07:44,674
...variances, tax incentives.
That sort of pesky nonsense.

25
00:07:46,144 --> 00:07:47,594
Power plant?

26
00:07:47,814 --> 00:07:52,304
Studies show we've enough power to get
us into the middle of the next century.

27
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:56,934
Your analysts foresee growth
at 1% per annum. That's not growth... that's a mild swelling.

28
00:07:58,704 --> 00:07:59,854
Imagine...

29
00:08:00,164 --> 00:08:01,654
...a Gotham City...

30
00:08:02,374 --> 00:08:05,784
...of the future, lit up like a blanket
of stars...

31
00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:08,614
...but blinking on and off...

32
00:08:09,004 --> 00:08:11,204
...embarrassingly low on juice.

33
00:08:11,464 --> 00:08:12,794
Frankly...

34
00:08:13,554 --> 00:08:15,454
...I cringe, Mr. Mayor.

35
00:08:16,634 --> 00:08:19,464
Sorry, any plans must go
to the usual committees...

36
00:08:19,554 --> 00:08:21,554
...through the usual channels.

37
00:08:21,644 --> 00:08:23,464
Um... I have a suggestion.

38
00:08:31,404 --> 00:08:32,474
Well...

39
00:08:33,404 --> 00:08:36,314
...actually, really, just more like a question.

40
00:08:38,494 --> 00:08:41,944
I'm afraid we haven't
properly housebroken Ms. Kyle.

41
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:44,784
In the plus column, though...

42
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,704
...she makes a hell of a cup of coffee.

43
00:08:55,394 --> 00:08:56,254
Dad.

44
00:08:57,264 --> 00:09:00,924
Mr. Mayor. Time to go down
and bring joy to the masses.

45
00:09:11,614 --> 00:09:13,364
"Actually, more of a question."

46
00:09:13,454 --> 00:09:15,274
You stupid corn dog.

47
00:09:16,544 --> 00:09:18,284
Corn dog, corn dog.

48
00:09:45,444 --> 00:09:49,444
I have enough signatures
from Shreck employees to warrant a recall.

49
00:09:49,624 --> 00:09:52,154
That's not a threat, just simple numbers.

50
00:09:52,244 --> 00:09:56,364
Maybe. But you sure as hell
don't have an issue or a candidate.

51
00:09:57,634 --> 00:09:59,784
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

52
00:10:00,714 --> 00:10:03,964
From those of us at City Hall
to each and every one of you...

53
00:10:04,054 --> 00:10:05,504
...happy holidays.

54
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:10,804
We have with us a man who needs
no introduction, he's given us so much.

55
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:15,094
Please welcome Gotham's
own Santa Claus, Max Shreck.

56
00:10:36,714 --> 00:10:39,544
Pick up those contracts for Personnel and...

57
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:42,504
...pick up the dry cleaning
and paper towels...

58
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,304
Darn!

59
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,724
I forgot my speech.

60
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,574
Remind me to take it out
on what's-her-name.

61
00:11:00,914 --> 00:11:02,364
Santa Claus?

62
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:03,904
Afraid not.

63
00:11:05,084 --> 00:11:07,614
I'm just a poor schmo. Got lucky.

64
00:11:09,214 --> 00:11:10,534
Sue me...

65
00:11:11,094 --> 00:11:13,124
...if I want to give some back.

66
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:19,044
I only wish I could hand out more
than just...

67
00:11:19,224 --> 00:11:20,884
...expensive baubles.

68
00:11:22,104 --> 00:11:24,844
I wish I could hand out world peace...

69
00:11:25,604 --> 00:11:27,844
...and unconditional love...

70
00:11:29,404 --> 00:11:31,434
...wrapped in a big bow.

71
00:11:33,074 --> 00:11:34,734
Oh, but you can.

72
00:11:35,284 --> 00:11:36,984
Oh, but you will.

73
00:11:43,924 --> 00:11:45,454
Merry Christmas.

74
00:11:58,934 --> 00:12:00,344
Great idea.

75
00:12:00,984 --> 00:12:02,084
Not mine.

76
00:12:54,714 --> 00:12:57,074
What are you waiting for? The signal!

77
00:13:28,414 --> 00:13:31,574
We want the big guy!
The guy who runs the show!

78
00:13:34,334 --> 00:13:35,494
What do you want?

79
00:13:35,594 --> 00:13:36,864
Not you!

80
00:13:37,764 --> 00:13:38,754
Shreck!

81
00:13:39,174 --> 00:13:41,174
You'll have to go through me.

82
00:13:43,104 --> 00:13:45,004
Dad, go! Save yourself!

83
00:13:45,264 --> 00:13:46,254
Dad, go!

84
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,844
Shut up!

85
00:15:49,994 --> 00:15:52,664
Take one step closer, Mr. Manbat, and I'll...

86
00:15:58,594 --> 00:15:59,744
You missed.

87
00:16:12,944 --> 00:16:14,344
The Batman.

88
00:16:15,104 --> 00:16:17,104
Or is it just "Batman"?

89
00:16:21,404 --> 00:16:23,104
Your choice, of course.

90
00:16:25,414 --> 00:16:26,904
Well, that was...

91
00:16:27,244 --> 00:16:28,574
...very brief.

92
00:16:29,084 --> 00:16:31,244
Just like all the men in my life.

93
00:16:32,084 --> 00:16:33,414
What men?

94
00:16:34,214 --> 00:16:35,234
Well...

95
00:16:36,254 --> 00:16:39,544
...then again, there's you.
But you need therapy.

96
00:17:01,284 --> 00:17:05,114
Thanks for saving the day, Batman.
The Circus Gang is back.

97
00:17:05,294 --> 00:17:06,454
We'll see.

98
00:17:06,624 --> 00:17:10,034
They almost made off with our mover
and shaker, Max Shreck.

99
00:17:10,794 --> 00:17:12,874
Where is that insufferable son of a bitch?

100
00:18:30,224 --> 00:18:33,174
I believe the word you're looking for is...

101
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:47,104
Actually, this is all just a bad dream.

102
00:18:48,244 --> 00:18:50,074
You're at home in bed...

103
00:18:50,244 --> 00:18:53,154
...heavily sedated, resting comfortably...

104
00:18:53,754 --> 00:18:57,494
...dying from the carcinogens
you've personally spewed...

105
00:18:58,594 --> 00:19:01,074
...in a lifetime of profiteering.

106
00:19:01,424 --> 00:19:02,834
Tragic irony...

107
00:19:03,014 --> 00:19:04,834
...or poetic justice?

108
00:19:05,014 --> 00:19:06,464
You tell me.

109
00:19:07,684 --> 00:19:09,424
My God, it's true.

110
00:19:09,854 --> 00:19:11,924
Penguin Man of the sewer.

111
00:19:16,194 --> 00:19:18,314
Odd as it may seem, Max...

112
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:22,024
...you and I have something in common:

113
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,684
We're both perceived as monsters.

114
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,574
But somehow...

115
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,634
...you're a well-respected monster...

116
00:19:36,964 --> 00:19:38,964
...and I am, to date...

117
00:19:39,974 --> 00:19:41,214
...not!

118
00:19:41,474 --> 00:19:44,924
Frankly, I feel that's a bum rap.
I'm a businessman.

119
00:19:45,314 --> 00:19:46,674
Tough, yes.

120
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:50,264
Shrewd, okay. But that does not
make me a monster.

121
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,354
Don't embarrass yourself, Max!

122
00:19:53,654 --> 00:19:55,524
I know all about you.

123
00:19:55,824 --> 00:19:57,944
What you hide, I discover.

124
00:19:59,034 --> 00:20:01,154
What you put in your toilet...

125
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:04,194
...I place on my mantle. Get the picture?

126
00:20:04,874 --> 00:20:07,154
Is that supposed to hypnotize me?

127
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,944
No, just give you a splitting headache.

128
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:12,244
It's not working.

129
00:20:13,384 --> 00:20:15,084
Oh, you big baby!

130
00:20:15,684 --> 00:20:17,004
Just blanks.

131
00:20:17,224 --> 00:20:20,344
Would I go through all this trouble
just to kill you?

132
00:20:20,564 --> 00:20:21,834
No, Max.

133
00:20:22,224 --> 00:20:24,714
I have an entirely other purpose.

134
00:20:25,904 --> 00:20:27,474
I'm ready, Max.

135
00:20:28,024 --> 00:20:30,314
I've been down here too long.

136
00:20:30,694 --> 00:20:32,984
It's time for me to ascend...

137
00:20:33,704 --> 00:20:35,404
...to re-emerge...

138
00:20:37,074 --> 00:20:38,614
...with your help...

139
00:20:38,744 --> 00:20:40,364
...your know-how...

140
00:20:40,544 --> 00:20:42,074
...your savvy.

141
00:20:42,914 --> 00:20:45,584
I wasn't born in the sewer, you know.

142
00:20:46,714 --> 00:20:48,244
I come from...

143
00:20:48,924 --> 00:20:50,254
...like you.

144
00:20:50,554 --> 00:20:53,114
And, like you, I want some respect!

145
00:20:53,894 --> 00:20:56,454
A recognition of my basic humanity.

146
00:20:57,264 --> 00:20:58,714
But most of all...

147
00:20:59,734 --> 00:21:02,094
...I want to find out who I am...

148
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:04,264
...by finding my parents...

149
00:21:04,444 --> 00:21:06,564
...learning my human name.

150
00:21:07,444 --> 00:21:11,394
Simple stuff that the good people
of Gotham take for granted!

151
00:21:12,914 --> 00:21:14,074
And...

152
00:21:14,244 --> 00:21:16,994
...exactly why am I going to help you?

153
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:19,954
Well...

154
00:21:24,634 --> 00:21:26,084
Let's start.

155
00:21:34,274 --> 00:21:36,634
Let's see what we have in here.

156
00:21:40,824 --> 00:21:42,894
A batch of toxic waste...

157
00:21:44,114 --> 00:21:46,594
...from your clean textile plant!

158
00:21:47,494 --> 00:21:50,734
There's a whole lagoon of this crud
in the back!

159
00:21:50,954 --> 00:21:53,114
It could have come from anywhere.

160
00:21:53,544 --> 00:21:58,034
What about the documents that prove you
own half of the firetraps in Gotham City?

161
00:21:58,294 --> 00:22:00,454
If there were such documents...

162
00:22:00,634 --> 00:22:02,414
...that's not an admission...

163
00:22:02,514 --> 00:22:04,544
...they would've been shredded.

164
00:22:05,434 --> 00:22:06,794
Good idea.

165
00:22:08,184 --> 00:22:12,094
A lot of tape and a little patience
make all the difference.

166
00:22:14,944 --> 00:22:16,434
By the way...

167
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:19,344
...how's Fred Atkins, your old partner?

168
00:22:19,614 --> 00:22:20,774
Fred?

169
00:22:21,864 --> 00:22:23,524
Fred's actually...

170
00:22:24,124 --> 00:22:27,234
I believe he's on an extended vacation.
He's good.

171
00:22:30,794 --> 00:22:31,954
Good.

172
00:22:33,964 --> 00:22:36,834
Hiya, Max. Remember me?
I'm Fred's hand!

173
00:22:38,134 --> 00:22:40,704
Want to greet any other body parts?

174
00:22:41,054 --> 00:22:42,714
Remember, Max...

175
00:22:42,974 --> 00:22:45,254
...you flush it, I flaunt it.

176
00:22:46,894 --> 00:22:49,294
You know what, Mr. Penguin, sir?

177
00:22:54,654 --> 00:22:56,234
I think, perhaps...

178
00:22:56,404 --> 00:22:59,814
...I could help orchestrate
a "Welcome Home" scenario for you.

179
00:22:59,914 --> 00:23:03,364
Once we're both back home,
perhaps we could help each other.

180
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:07,114
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.

181
00:23:15,014 --> 00:23:16,674
Honey, I'm home!

182
00:23:18,854 --> 00:23:21,214
Oh, I forgot. I'm not married.

183
00:23:31,784 --> 00:23:33,194
Miss Kitty.

184
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:38,154
Back from more sexual escapades
you refuse to share?

185
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,364
Not that I'd ever pry.

186
00:23:44,294 --> 00:23:45,704
Drink your dinner.

187
00:23:52,304 --> 00:23:53,464
What?

188
00:23:54,974 --> 00:23:57,304
How can anyone be so pathetic?

189
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:01,894
Yes, to you I seem pathetic,
but I'm a working girl.

190
00:24:02,064 --> 00:24:05,894
Must pay the rent. Maybe if you
chipped in instead of stepping out.

191
00:24:07,744 --> 00:24:11,234
Selina, dear, it's your mother.
Just calling to say hello.

192
00:24:11,414 --> 00:24:12,734
Yeah, but...

193
00:24:12,914 --> 00:24:16,244
But I'm disappointed you're not
coming home for Christmas.

194
00:24:16,334 --> 00:24:19,824
I want to discuss why you insist
on languishing in Gotham City...

195
00:24:19,924 --> 00:24:21,914
...as some lowly secretary.

196
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:23,744
Lowly assistant.

197
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:28,834
Selina, about that Christmas getaway
we planned...

198
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:34,764
I'll be going alone. Dr. Shaw says I need
to be my own person, not an appendage.

199
00:24:39,194 --> 00:24:40,764
Some appendage!

200
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:50,024
The party never stops
on Selina Kyle's answering machine.

201
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:55,204
I should've let him win
that last racquetball game.

202
00:24:55,544 --> 00:24:56,534
Hello...

203
00:24:56,714 --> 00:24:58,204
...Selina Kyle.

204
00:24:58,384 --> 00:25:01,794
We're calling to tell you about exciting,
new Gotham Lady perfume.

205
00:25:01,884 --> 00:25:06,464
It makes women feel like women...
and the men have no complaints either.

206
00:25:08,814 --> 00:25:13,384
This is yourself reminding you to come
all the way back to the office...

207
00:25:14,774 --> 00:25:18,394
...if you forgot the Bruce Wayne file...
- You stupid corn dog!

208
00:25:38,054 --> 00:25:39,504
Working late?

209
00:25:41,894 --> 00:25:45,964
I'm just boning up for your Bruce Wayne
meeting in the morning.

210
00:25:46,684 --> 00:25:50,184
I pulled all the files
on the proposed power plant...

211
00:25:52,694 --> 00:25:56,944
...and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment.
I even opened the protected files...

212
00:25:58,204 --> 00:25:59,564
How industrious!

213
00:26:01,244 --> 00:26:03,574
How did you open the protected files?

214
00:26:04,584 --> 00:26:05,744
May I ask?

215
00:26:11,384 --> 00:26:15,624
I figured your password was "Geraldo,"
your Chihuahua, and it was.

216
00:26:23,394 --> 00:26:27,684
This is all very interesting,
though a bit on the technical side...

217
00:26:29,944 --> 00:26:33,564
...about how the power plant
is a power plant in name only...

218
00:26:33,914 --> 00:26:37,234
...since, in fact, it's going to be a big,
giant...

219
00:26:37,784 --> 00:26:39,904
...big, giant... capacitor.

220
00:26:42,584 --> 00:26:46,584
And, instead of generating power,
it'll be sucking power from...

221
00:26:47,464 --> 00:26:48,914
...Gotham City...

222
00:26:50,094 --> 00:26:51,624
...and storing it...

223
00:26:52,264 --> 00:26:53,924
...stockpiling it...

224
00:26:54,304 --> 00:26:57,264
...which is a very novel approach, I'd say.

225
00:27:00,144 --> 00:27:01,764
Who'd you say this to?

226
00:27:05,444 --> 00:27:06,434
Nobody.

227
00:27:12,784 --> 00:27:15,274
What did curiosity do to the cat?

228
00:27:17,504 --> 00:27:18,914
I'm no cat.

229
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:21,664
I'm just an assistant.

230
00:27:22,134 --> 00:27:23,294
A secretary.

231
00:27:23,844 --> 00:27:25,664
And a very good one.

232
00:27:26,514 --> 00:27:27,784
Too good?

233
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,084
Listen...

234
00:27:30,184 --> 00:27:32,344
...it's our secret. Honest.

235
00:27:32,644 --> 00:27:35,474
How can you be so mean
to someone so meaningless?

236
00:27:35,644 --> 00:27:37,134
This power plant...

237
00:27:37,654 --> 00:27:40,354
...is my legacy. It's what I leave behind.

238
00:27:40,524 --> 00:27:41,804
For Chip.

239
00:27:42,154 --> 00:27:44,274
Nothing must prevent that.

240
00:27:47,824 --> 00:27:51,774
Go ahead. Intimidate me.
Bully me, if it makes you feel big.

241
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:54,204
It's not like you can kill me!

242
00:27:54,624 --> 00:27:56,994
Actually, it's a lot like that.

243
00:28:14,904 --> 00:28:17,644
For a second, you really frightened me.

244
00:28:28,334 --> 00:28:29,494
Really?

245
00:29:45,214 --> 00:29:46,534
Honey, I'm home!

246
00:29:49,804 --> 00:29:51,874
Oh, I forgot. I'm not married.

247
00:30:27,844 --> 00:30:30,594
Selina, this is your mother. Call me.

248
00:30:31,854 --> 00:30:35,764
Selina, this is your mother.
Why haven't you called me back?

249
00:30:36,394 --> 00:30:38,184
Hello, Selina Kyle.

250
00:30:39,024 --> 00:30:42,474
We're just calling to make sure
you've tried Gotham Lady perfume.

251
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:46,814
One whiff of this and your boss
will ask you to stay after work...

252
00:30:47,034 --> 00:30:49,734
...for a candlelight staff meeting for two.

253
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:53,904
Gotham Lady perfume.
Exclusively at Shreck's department store.

254
00:33:38,274 --> 00:33:41,564
I don't know about you,
Miss Kitty, but I feel...

255
00:33:42,364 --> 00:33:44,144
...so much yummier.

256
00:34:02,804 --> 00:34:04,384
Ladies and gentlemen:

257
00:34:06,224 --> 00:34:11,134
I stand before you again to denounce
the urban chaos we live with in our city.

258
00:34:12,394 --> 00:34:13,804
It's got to stop.

259
00:34:13,984 --> 00:34:17,014
It's going to stop!
Our community is coming apart...

260
00:34:17,284 --> 00:34:20,564
...in a season when
it should be coming together.

261
00:34:20,654 --> 00:34:24,234
I don't care what the cynics may say.
This is the Christmas season...

262
00:34:24,334 --> 00:34:25,984
...and should be a healing time.

263
00:34:26,084 --> 00:34:28,644
I say that not only as an official...

264
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,664
...but as a husband and a father.

265
00:34:32,084 --> 00:34:34,574
Last night's violence won't happen again.

266
00:34:37,924 --> 00:34:41,004
I'm not good at speeches,
so I'll just say, "Thanks. "

267
00:34:49,774 --> 00:34:52,064
It's the hideous Penguin Man.

268
00:34:52,614 --> 00:34:55,234
Take the baby. Just don't hurt me, please!

269
00:35:48,174 --> 00:35:52,254
This was the remarkable scene
only minutes ago in Gotham Plaza.

270
00:35:52,434 --> 00:35:55,924
The mysterious Penguin saving the life
of the mayor's baby...

271
00:35:56,104 --> 00:35:59,844
...and announcing his presence.
- All I want in return...

272
00:36:00,734 --> 00:36:02,354
...is a chance...

273
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:04,814
...to find my mom and dad.

274
00:36:06,574 --> 00:36:09,194
A chance to find out who they are...

275
00:36:10,414 --> 00:36:11,864
...and thusly...

276
00:36:12,204 --> 00:36:13,654
...who I am.

277
00:36:14,414 --> 00:36:15,744
And then...

278
00:36:16,044 --> 00:36:17,904
...with my parents...

279
00:36:18,214 --> 00:36:20,374
...try to understand... why.

280
00:36:21,924 --> 00:36:25,414
Why they did what I guess
they felt they had to do...

281
00:36:27,594 --> 00:36:29,254
...to a child...

282
00:36:29,934 --> 00:36:31,554
...who was born...

283
00:36:34,604 --> 00:36:36,514
...a little different.

284
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,504
A child...

285
00:36:40,074 --> 00:36:42,604
...who spent his first Christmas...

286
00:36:43,574 --> 00:36:45,404
...and many since...

287
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,274
...in a sewer.

288
00:36:48,454 --> 00:36:50,694
Mr. Wayne? Something wrong?

289
00:36:54,294 --> 00:36:55,454
His parents.

290
00:36:55,634 --> 00:36:57,954
This scene, direct from Gotham Plaza.

291
00:36:59,424 --> 00:37:01,124
I hope he finds them.

292
00:37:02,134 --> 00:37:06,084
Here he is, standing alongside
Gotham's leading citizen, Max Shreck.

293
00:37:06,264 --> 00:37:09,134
How about a statement?
People want to know.

294
00:37:19,994 --> 00:37:23,154
- Penguin's not to be disturbed!
- It's a public place!

295
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:25,824
- Walk. Now. Move.
- Freedom of the press!

296
00:37:25,914 --> 00:37:27,444
Wait a minute.

297
00:37:28,584 --> 00:37:31,914
What about the freedom
to rediscover your roots...

298
00:37:32,424 --> 00:37:34,414
...with dignity and privacy?

299
00:37:34,594 --> 00:37:36,914
Is the Penguin a personal friend?

300
00:37:37,094 --> 00:37:40,754
He's a personal friend of the whole city,
so have a heart.

301
00:37:41,014 --> 00:37:43,804
Give the Constitution a rest.
It's Christmas.

302
00:38:23,314 --> 00:38:27,144
"Red Triangle Circus put on
a swell show with fierce lions.

303
00:38:31,364 --> 00:38:33,734
"Circus returns for a two-week...

304
00:38:33,994 --> 00:38:35,484
"Kids will love..."

305
00:38:35,994 --> 00:38:37,074
Thanks.

306
00:38:41,374 --> 00:38:42,404
It's cold!

307
00:38:42,504 --> 00:38:43,914
It's vichyssoise.

308
00:38:45,094 --> 00:38:46,834
It's supposed to be cold.

309
00:38:49,384 --> 00:38:52,674
"Circus is back with a freak show,
may not be suitable for kids...

310
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:54,844
"...featuring a poodle lady...

311
00:38:55,104 --> 00:38:57,094
"...the world's fattest man...

312
00:38:57,354 --> 00:38:59,474
"...and Aquatic Bird Boy."

313
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:03,144
Why are you determined to prove...

314
00:39:03,404 --> 00:39:06,274
...that this Penguin is not what he seems?

315
00:39:06,694 --> 00:39:09,774
Must you be the only lonely "man-beast"
in town?

316
00:39:10,034 --> 00:39:12,114
"The circus folded its tents yesterday...

317
00:39:12,204 --> 00:39:15,404
"...after reports of missing children
in several towns.

318
00:39:15,624 --> 00:39:18,614
"Police have closed down
the Red Triangle fairgrounds.

319
00:39:18,714 --> 00:39:22,404
"However, at least one
freak-show performer vanished before...

320
00:39:22,884 --> 00:39:25,044
"...he could be questioned."

321
00:39:26,804 --> 00:39:28,794
I suppose you feel better now.

322
00:39:31,644 --> 00:39:32,634
No.

323
00:39:33,934 --> 00:39:35,934
Actually, I feel worse.

324
00:39:54,464 --> 00:39:55,954
Why're you still out?

325
00:39:56,044 --> 00:39:59,954
Are you concerned about that strange,
heroic Penguin person?

326
00:40:01,674 --> 00:40:04,044
I think he knows who his parents are.

327
00:40:05,894 --> 00:40:07,674
There's something else.

328
00:42:03,944 --> 00:42:05,184
Mr. Penguin...

329
00:42:05,284 --> 00:42:07,894
A penguin is a bird that cannot fly!

330
00:42:09,614 --> 00:42:11,024
I am a man!

331
00:42:12,204 --> 00:42:13,734
I have a name!

332
00:42:17,714 --> 00:42:19,414
Oswald Cobblepot!

333
00:42:21,294 --> 00:42:24,164
You'll never be able to settle with them?

334
00:42:27,644 --> 00:42:28,794
True.

335
00:42:29,894 --> 00:42:32,134
I was their "Number-One" son...

336
00:42:32,474 --> 00:42:35,044
...and they treated me like number two.

337
00:42:35,984 --> 00:42:38,384
But it's human nature to fear...

338
00:42:39,904 --> 00:42:41,314
...the unusual.

339
00:42:42,324 --> 00:42:43,694
Perhaps...

340
00:42:44,154 --> 00:42:45,694
...when I held my...

341
00:42:45,824 --> 00:42:47,824
...Tiffany baby rattle...

342
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:50,904
...with a shiny flipper...

343
00:42:51,334 --> 00:42:53,904
...instead of five chubby digits...

344
00:42:55,424 --> 00:42:57,084
...they freaked.

345
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:02,624
But I forgive them.

346
00:43:04,344 --> 00:43:07,344
"Penguin forgives parents!
'I'm at peace with myself and the world!

347
00:43:07,434 --> 00:43:10,004
"'Don't need hands as long
as you got heart.

348
00:43:10,144 --> 00:43:13,344
"'My heart is filled with love.
I feel five feet tall."'

349
00:43:13,444 --> 00:43:17,384
- He's like a frog that became a prince.
- No, he's more like a penguin.

350
00:43:23,034 --> 00:43:25,364
Now, now, pretty little thing.

351
00:43:25,794 --> 00:43:27,324
Nice and easy.

352
00:43:31,634 --> 00:43:36,374
I love a big, strong man who's not afraid
to show it with someone half his size.

353
00:43:38,844 --> 00:43:41,174
Be gentle, it's my first time.

354
00:43:48,404 --> 00:43:49,854
Tic-tac-toe.

355
00:43:55,324 --> 00:43:57,564
You make it easy, don't you?

356
00:43:58,074 --> 00:44:00,824
Always waiting for some Batman
to save you.

357
00:44:03,714 --> 00:44:05,364
I am Catwoman...

358
00:44:06,504 --> 00:44:08,164
...hear me roar.

359
00:44:22,524 --> 00:44:26,604
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant
is using her vacation time.

360
00:44:26,734 --> 00:44:31,524
Good time. Everyone but the bandits'll
be slacking off till after the New Year.

361
00:44:32,114 --> 00:44:34,274
I'm not sure I like the inference.

362
00:44:34,374 --> 00:44:36,274
I didn't realize I made one.

363
00:44:41,044 --> 00:44:45,124
I'm pushing this power plant now
because it'll cost more later.

364
00:44:45,714 --> 00:44:47,954
A million saved is a million earned.

365
00:44:48,764 --> 00:44:51,544
I commissioned this report.
Take a look at it.

366
00:44:53,974 --> 00:44:57,634
Gotham City has a power surplus.
I'm sure you know that.

367
00:44:58,234 --> 00:44:59,804
My question is:

368
00:45:00,734 --> 00:45:01,894
What's your angle?

369
00:45:01,984 --> 00:45:04,604
"Power surplus?" Bruce, shame on you!

370
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:08,774
No such thing. One can never have
too much power.

371
00:45:09,074 --> 00:45:12,154
If my life has a meaning,
that's the meaning.

372
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:18,114
I'll fight you. I've already spoken
to the mayor and we agree.

373
00:45:18,294 --> 00:45:19,784
Mayors come and go.

374
00:45:20,004 --> 00:45:21,874
Blue bloods tire easily.

375
00:45:22,174 --> 00:45:24,654
Can you go 15 rounds
with Muhammad Shreck?

376
00:45:24,884 --> 00:45:26,874
I guess we'll find out.

377
00:45:27,184 --> 00:45:30,214
Of course, I don't have a crime boss
like Cobblepot in my corner.

378
00:45:30,314 --> 00:45:32,674
"Crime boss?" Shows what you know...

379
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:35,634
..."Mr. To-The-Manor-Born-
With-A-Silver-Spoon."

380
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:38,014
Oswald is Gotham's new golden boy.

381
00:45:38,274 --> 00:45:41,934
If his parents hadn't 86'ed him,
you'd have been bunkies at prep school.

382
00:45:42,034 --> 00:45:46,064
He controls the Red Triangle Gang.
I can't prove it yet, but we both...

383
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:48,914
I'll not stand for mud-slinging here.

384
00:45:49,084 --> 00:45:52,454
If my assistant was here,
she'd have already escorted you out...

385
00:45:52,544 --> 00:45:54,074
Anywhere he wants.

386
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,904
Preferably some nightspot grotto...

387
00:45:58,254 --> 00:45:59,254
...or...

388
00:45:59,714 --> 00:46:01,544
...secluded hideaway.

389
00:46:03,554 --> 00:46:04,924
Nice suit.

390
00:46:11,234 --> 00:46:15,434
That's my name, don't wear it out
or I'll make you buy me a new one.

391
00:46:19,744 --> 00:46:21,404
This is Bruce...

392
00:46:21,784 --> 00:46:22,864
...Wayne.

393
00:46:23,664 --> 00:46:24,764
We've met.

394
00:46:25,294 --> 00:46:26,284
Have we?

395
00:46:26,454 --> 00:46:29,614
No, I'm sorry. I mistook me
for somebody else.

396
00:46:31,134 --> 00:46:32,834
You mean, "mistook me."

397
00:46:33,594 --> 00:46:35,584
Isn't that what I said?

398
00:46:36,264 --> 00:46:37,874
I don't think so.

399
00:46:39,264 --> 00:46:40,504
What happened?

400
00:46:41,764 --> 00:46:44,714
Did you hurt yourself... on that ski slope?

401
00:46:46,274 --> 00:46:49,604
Is that why you cut short your vacation?
Came back?

402
00:46:52,904 --> 00:46:54,354
It's a blur.

403
00:46:55,824 --> 00:47:00,404
Not complete amnesia. I remember
Sister Mary Margaret puking in church...

404
00:47:01,334 --> 00:47:03,814
...and Betsy saying
it was morning sickness.

405
00:47:03,914 --> 00:47:07,074
And the time I forgot to wear
my underpants to school...

406
00:47:07,174 --> 00:47:11,004
...and the name of the boy who noticed
was Ricky Friedburg.

407
00:47:12,014 --> 00:47:13,544
He's dead now.

408
00:47:13,934 --> 00:47:15,424
But last night...

409
00:47:15,644 --> 00:47:17,344
...complete blur.

410
00:47:19,144 --> 00:47:21,054
Couldn't you just die?

411
00:47:25,194 --> 00:47:26,514
Please...

412
00:47:27,694 --> 00:47:29,314
...show out Mr. Wayne.

413
00:47:29,654 --> 00:47:31,024
With pleasure.

414
00:47:33,534 --> 00:47:35,404
Your coat, Mr. Wayne.

415
00:47:49,304 --> 00:47:52,544
You don't seem like the type
who does business with Shreck.

416
00:47:52,644 --> 00:47:55,384
No. You don't seem like the type
to take orders from him.

417
00:47:55,474 --> 00:47:56,884
Well, that's a...

418
00:47:57,144 --> 00:47:58,684
...long story.

419
00:47:59,484 --> 00:48:01,604
I could free up some time.

420
00:48:03,404 --> 00:48:05,394
- I'm listed.
- I'm tempted.

421
00:48:05,654 --> 00:48:06,844
I'm working.

422
00:48:08,164 --> 00:48:09,404
I'm leaving.

423
00:48:09,914 --> 00:48:11,904
You buy that blurry business?

424
00:48:12,084 --> 00:48:13,154
Women.

425
00:48:13,584 --> 00:48:15,444
Nothing surprises me...

426
00:48:16,004 --> 00:48:17,824
...except your late mother.

427
00:48:18,424 --> 00:48:21,244
Who'd have thought Selina
had a brain to damage?

428
00:48:21,424 --> 00:48:22,874
Bottom line?

429
00:48:23,264 --> 00:48:27,254
She tries to blackmail me,
I'll drop her out of a higher window.

430
00:48:27,434 --> 00:48:28,594
Meantime...

431
00:48:28,684 --> 00:48:31,054
...l've got badder fish to fry.

432
00:48:42,614 --> 00:48:43,944
Oswald...

433
00:48:44,534 --> 00:48:45,864
...it's Max.

434
00:48:59,214 --> 00:49:00,624
You're home?

435
00:49:08,064 --> 00:49:09,384
How've you been?

436
00:49:11,064 --> 00:49:12,934
Your extended family?

437
00:49:13,404 --> 00:49:15,014
Good to have a family.

438
00:49:16,824 --> 00:49:18,984
I'd rather not be disturbed now.

439
00:49:19,324 --> 00:49:22,234
Come on downstairs, Oswald.
I have a surprise.

440
00:49:22,414 --> 00:49:24,404
I don't like surprises.

441
00:49:41,434 --> 00:49:42,424
Come on.

442
00:49:55,454 --> 00:49:56,694
Don't peek.

443
00:49:58,874 --> 00:50:00,274
You'll spoil it.

444
00:50:23,654 --> 00:50:26,814
Adulation is a cross to bear.
God knows I know.

445
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:31,684
But someone's got to supplant our
standing in the way of progress, Mayor.

446
00:50:31,784 --> 00:50:35,324
And don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot,
you've got the magic.

447
00:50:35,494 --> 00:50:38,994
Your charisma's bigger than both of us.
Come on down.

448
00:50:41,174 --> 00:50:42,354
Mayor?

449
00:50:43,504 --> 00:50:44,694
Mayor.

450
00:50:46,764 --> 00:50:49,924
Elections happen in November.
It's late December.

451
00:50:50,094 --> 00:50:51,424
Don't worry.

452
00:50:51,594 --> 00:50:55,174
I want you to meet Jen and Josh,
my image consultants.

453
00:50:56,774 --> 00:50:57,924
Here.

454
00:50:58,104 --> 00:51:00,094
Reclaim your birthright.

455
00:51:02,734 --> 00:51:04,004
I'm Jen.

456
00:51:07,574 --> 00:51:12,074
Okay, let's see. What I'd like to do first
is put these gloves on you.

457
00:51:12,414 --> 00:51:15,404
Our research tells us
that voters like fingers.

458
00:51:15,584 --> 00:51:18,154
So if we were to just lose this...

459
00:51:19,754 --> 00:51:21,704
We'll do it another time.

460
00:51:23,424 --> 00:51:26,834
Not a lot of reflective surfaces
in the sewer, huh?

461
00:51:38,274 --> 00:51:40,184
Still, it could be worse.

462
00:51:40,944 --> 00:51:43,314
My nose could be gushing blood.

463
00:51:47,084 --> 00:51:49,154
What do you mean by that?

464
00:51:54,134 --> 00:51:56,164
Everybody, back to work!

465
00:51:56,964 --> 00:51:58,454
Let's make...

466
00:51:59,134 --> 00:52:00,544
...a mayor!

467
00:52:06,144 --> 00:52:09,134
You're right, we missed
the regular election...

468
00:52:09,314 --> 00:52:12,054
...but elected officials can be recalled,
impeached...

469
00:52:12,154 --> 00:52:14,824
...given the boot. Look at Nixon, Agnew.

470
00:52:14,984 --> 00:52:16,524
Then think of you...

471
00:52:16,654 --> 00:52:19,394
...Oswald Cobblepot, filling the void.

472
00:52:20,164 --> 00:52:21,944
I'd like to fill her void.

473
00:52:24,494 --> 00:52:28,744
We'll need signatures to overturn
the ballot. I can supply those.

474
00:52:29,334 --> 00:52:33,244
- Teach her my French flipper trick.
- We need one more thing.

475
00:52:35,634 --> 00:52:37,044
A platform?

476
00:52:38,514 --> 00:52:42,924
Stop global warming. Start global cooling.
Make the world an icebox.

477
00:52:43,354 --> 00:52:47,644
I like it. But to get the mayor recalled,
we must have a catalyst.

478
00:52:48,194 --> 00:52:50,514
"You're doing great, Mayor Cobblepot."

479
00:52:51,154 --> 00:52:53,934
"Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot."

480
00:52:54,654 --> 00:52:57,404
"I need you, Oswald. I need you now! "

481
00:52:59,334 --> 00:53:02,324
"That's the biggest parasol I've ever seen."

482
00:53:03,834 --> 00:53:08,084
Soon an incident like the Gulf of Tonkin,
or the Reichstag fire...

483
00:53:15,554 --> 00:53:18,044
You want my old friends up there...

484
00:53:18,224 --> 00:53:20,894
...to drive the mayor into a foaming frenzy?

485
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:22,934
- Exactly.
- Sounds fun.

486
00:53:23,734 --> 00:53:24,804
But...

487
00:53:25,654 --> 00:53:28,274
...I mustn't get sidetracked, Maxie.

488
00:53:28,744 --> 00:53:30,894
I have my own things to tend to.

489
00:53:31,244 --> 00:53:34,734
"Sidetracked?" This is your chance
to fulfill your destiny...

490
00:53:34,914 --> 00:53:37,474
...that your parents carelessly discarded.

491
00:53:41,424 --> 00:53:43,494
Reclaim my birthright, you mean?

492
00:53:43,674 --> 00:53:46,664
Imagine, as mayor,
you have the ear of the media...

493
00:53:46,924 --> 00:53:49,794
...access to the captains of industry...

494
00:53:50,344 --> 00:53:52,254
...unlimited poontang.

495
00:53:55,854 --> 00:53:58,254
You drive a hard bargain, Maxie.

496
00:53:59,604 --> 00:54:01,434
All right, I'll be mayor.

497
00:54:05,444 --> 00:54:07,144
Burn, baby, burn!

498
00:56:49,434 --> 00:56:51,504
- Who is she?
- What is she?

499
00:56:51,934 --> 00:56:54,884
I don't know whether to open fire
or fall in love.

500
00:56:55,604 --> 00:56:57,094
You poor guys.

501
00:56:57,274 --> 00:57:00,554
Always confusing your pistols
with your privates.

502
00:57:02,904 --> 00:57:05,644
Don't hurt us. Our take-home's
less than $300.

503
00:57:05,744 --> 00:57:07,774
You're overpaid. Hit the road.

504
00:57:26,144 --> 00:57:27,964
Go ahead and hit me.

505
00:58:06,354 --> 00:58:08,054
Admiring your handiwork?

506
00:58:10,314 --> 00:58:12,304
Touring the riot scene.

507
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:16,354
Gravely assessing the devastation.

508
00:58:18,534 --> 00:58:20,524
"Upstanding-Mayor" stuff.

509
00:58:24,744 --> 00:58:26,324
You're not the mayor.

510
00:58:28,214 --> 00:58:29,744
Things change.

511
00:58:31,754 --> 00:58:33,164
What do you want?

512
00:58:34,054 --> 00:58:35,874
The direct approach.

513
00:58:36,224 --> 00:58:38,784
I admire that in a man with a mask.

514
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:46,554
You don't really think you'll win, do you?

515
00:58:49,404 --> 00:58:50,934
Things change.

516
00:59:16,104 --> 00:59:18,384
I saw her first. Got to fly.

517
01:00:07,914 --> 01:00:10,154
How could you? I'm a woman!

518
01:00:10,914 --> 01:00:12,154
I'm sorry.

519
01:00:26,184 --> 01:00:30,094
As I was saying, I'm a woman
and can't be taken for granted.

520
01:00:31,774 --> 01:00:34,014
Life's a bitch, now so am I.

521
01:00:51,044 --> 01:00:52,204
Who are you?

522
01:00:52,874 --> 01:00:54,834
Who's the man behind the bat?

523
01:00:56,884 --> 01:00:58,954
Maybe you can help me find...

524
01:00:59,474 --> 01:01:00,874
...the woman...

525
01:01:01,554 --> 01:01:03,134
...behind the cat.

526
01:01:05,894 --> 01:01:07,674
No, that's not you.

527
01:01:11,314 --> 01:01:12,644
There you are.

528
01:01:28,674 --> 01:01:30,574
Saved by Kitty Litter.

529
01:01:34,594 --> 01:01:35,864
Bastard!

530
01:01:53,194 --> 01:01:54,274
Alfred...

531
01:01:55,034 --> 01:01:57,604
...bring me some antiseptic ointment.

532
01:01:57,784 --> 01:01:59,944
Coming. Are you in pain, sir?

533
01:02:02,794 --> 01:02:04,114
Not really.

534
01:02:26,484 --> 01:02:29,104
I may have saved the mayor's baby...

535
01:02:30,744 --> 01:02:33,224
...but I refuse to save a mayor...

536
01:02:33,414 --> 01:02:36,154
...who stood by, helpless as a baby...

537
01:02:36,584 --> 01:02:39,534
...while Gotham was ravaged
by a disease...

538
01:02:40,624 --> 01:02:43,914
...that turned Eagle Scouts
into crazed clowns...

539
01:02:45,424 --> 01:02:48,164
...and happy homemakers into catwomen.

540
01:02:49,344 --> 01:02:50,454
Thank you.

541
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:57,974
Oswald Cobblepot, the mystery man-beast,
made his bid to run Gotham.

542
01:03:00,984 --> 01:03:05,484
Mr. Cobblepot, you are the coolest
role model a young person could have.

543
01:03:06,114 --> 01:03:08,594
And you're the hottest young person...

544
01:03:08,784 --> 01:03:10,944
...a role model could have.

545
01:03:13,454 --> 01:03:14,484
Here.

546
01:03:15,504 --> 01:03:17,034
Wear a button.

547
01:03:18,504 --> 01:03:20,664
Let me just get it on here.

548
01:03:25,304 --> 01:03:26,634
Thank you.

549
01:03:31,484 --> 01:03:35,974
This mayor stuff is not about power,
it's about reaching out to people...

550
01:03:36,154 --> 01:03:38,224
...touching people, groping people.

551
01:03:38,324 --> 01:03:40,234
- Penguin...
- My name is not Penguin!

552
01:03:40,324 --> 01:03:42,234
It's Oswald Cobblepot.

553
01:03:42,864 --> 01:03:45,734
Oswald, there's somebody here to see you.

554
01:03:54,044 --> 01:03:56,714
Just the pussy I've been looking for.

555
01:04:01,514 --> 01:04:03,344
It's chilly in here.

556
01:04:04,514 --> 01:04:05,844
I'll warm you.

557
01:04:06,224 --> 01:04:07,724
Down, Oswald.

558
01:04:10,064 --> 01:04:11,514
We need to talk.

559
01:04:11,694 --> 01:04:13,054
You see...

560
01:04:13,234 --> 01:04:15,974
...you and I have something in common.

561
01:04:16,244 --> 01:04:17,894
Sounds familiar.

562
01:04:18,404 --> 01:04:20,484
Appetite for destruction?

563
01:04:20,704 --> 01:04:23,024
Contempt for the czars of fashion?

564
01:04:23,374 --> 01:04:25,194
Wait, don't tell me.

565
01:04:25,414 --> 01:04:27,324
Naked sexual charisma?

566
01:04:28,884 --> 01:04:30,124
Batman.

567
01:04:31,254 --> 01:04:33,504
The thorn in both our sides.

568
01:04:34,214 --> 01:04:36,254
The fly in our ointment.

569
01:04:36,884 --> 01:04:38,214
Ointment?

570
01:04:38,724 --> 01:04:41,094
I've got scented and unscented.

571
01:04:41,604 --> 01:04:43,384
I'll come back later.

572
01:04:43,894 --> 01:04:47,754
Perchance, are you a registered voter?
I'm a mayoral prospect.

573
01:04:47,944 --> 01:04:50,314
I have but one pet cause today:

574
01:04:51,284 --> 01:04:52,734
Ban the Bat.

575
01:04:53,244 --> 01:04:57,314
Oh, him again. No bother.
He's already history. Check it out.

576
01:04:58,034 --> 01:05:02,454
We'll disassemble his Batmobile
and turn it into an H-bomb on wheels.

577
01:05:05,964 --> 01:05:08,444
He'd have even more power as a martyr.

578
01:05:08,714 --> 01:05:13,174
To destroy Batman, we must first
turn him into what he hates the most.

579
01:05:13,804 --> 01:05:15,214
Namely, us.

580
01:05:17,144 --> 01:05:18,464
Frame him?

581
01:05:18,644 --> 01:05:21,804
Not even in office yet
and already an enemies list.

582
01:05:23,654 --> 01:05:26,264
Those names are not for prying eyes.

583
01:05:28,154 --> 01:05:30,944
Why should I trust some catbroad anyway?

584
01:05:32,164 --> 01:05:36,324
Maybe you're a screwed-up sorority chick
getting back at her daddy...

585
01:05:36,504 --> 01:05:40,034
...for not buying her that pony
when she turned sweet-sixteen.

586
01:05:57,274 --> 01:05:58,724
Nice birdie.

587
01:06:14,124 --> 01:06:15,534
Nice kitty.

588
01:06:16,044 --> 01:06:17,454
Nice kitty.

589
01:06:24,304 --> 01:06:26,294
Batman napalmed my arm.

590
01:06:26,894 --> 01:06:31,054
He knocked me off a building just
when I started to feel good about myself.

591
01:06:31,144 --> 01:06:34,304
I want to play an integral part
in his degradation.

592
01:06:38,484 --> 01:06:40,234
A plan is forming.

593
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:49,614
I want in.

594
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:55,164
The thought of busting Batman
makes me feel all...

595
01:06:57,264 --> 01:06:58,334
...dirty.

596
01:07:02,434 --> 01:07:05,504
Maybe I'll just give myself a bath
right here.

597
01:07:16,404 --> 01:07:18,274
I challenge the mayor...

598
01:07:18,454 --> 01:07:22,274
...to re-light the Christmas tree
in Gotham Plaza tomorrow night.

599
01:07:23,454 --> 01:07:28,164
Sir, shall we change the channel
to a program with some dignity and class?

600
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:31,034
The Love Connection perhaps?

601
01:07:33,464 --> 01:07:35,664
...not that I have any faith in the mayor.

602
01:07:35,764 --> 01:07:37,634
But I hope and pray...

603
01:07:37,974 --> 01:07:39,424
...that Batman...

604
01:07:39,604 --> 01:07:42,424
...will be present to preserve the peace.

605
01:07:43,774 --> 01:07:44,934
Subtle.

606
01:07:48,484 --> 01:07:50,434
Why are you doing this?

607
01:07:52,654 --> 01:07:53,814
Selina?

608
01:07:55,994 --> 01:07:58,324
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

609
01:07:58,494 --> 01:08:01,164
Scare me? I was just scaring myself.

610
01:08:02,004 --> 01:08:03,994
I don't see how, but...

611
01:08:04,294 --> 01:08:07,584
It's nice to see you in the real world,
away from Shreck.

612
01:08:09,134 --> 01:08:10,834
It's nice to be here.

613
01:08:14,184 --> 01:08:15,634
Are you all right?

614
01:08:17,644 --> 01:08:20,764
You look like you have the holiday blues
or something.

615
01:08:23,654 --> 01:08:25,724
Boy, the news these days.

616
01:08:26,694 --> 01:08:27,684
Weird!

617
01:08:29,454 --> 01:08:32,564
I heard on TV that Catwoman
weighs 140 pounds.

618
01:08:34,704 --> 01:08:36,864
How do these hacks sleep at night?

619
01:08:37,044 --> 01:08:39,824
It's not even accurate. "Batman blows it"?

620
01:08:40,174 --> 01:08:43,204
He probably saved millions
in property damage alone.

621
01:08:44,504 --> 01:08:48,174
You're not going to the re-lighting
of the tree, are you?

622
01:08:48,384 --> 01:08:50,714
I wouldn't be caught dead there.

623
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:55,174
It's going to be a hot time
in the cold town tonight.

624
01:08:57,234 --> 01:09:00,014
You got kind of a dark side, don't you?

625
01:09:00,694 --> 01:09:02,224
No darker than yours.

626
01:09:06,414 --> 01:09:09,694
Why don't you come over
and we can watch it on TV?

627
01:09:10,084 --> 01:09:12,234
The tree-lighting ceremony.

628
01:09:12,544 --> 01:09:15,414
I can't. I have to be somewhere tonight.

629
01:09:16,254 --> 01:09:18,704
How about coming for dinner at five?

630
01:09:18,884 --> 01:09:20,204
Let's say six?

631
01:09:21,384 --> 01:09:22,164
Five.

632
01:09:22,264 --> 01:09:23,714
Five. You and me.

633
01:09:31,394 --> 01:09:34,514
The tree lights up
and then I push the button.

634
01:09:34,854 --> 01:09:36,014
Wait, wait.

635
01:09:36,194 --> 01:09:39,144
I push the button, then the tree lights up.

636
01:09:41,454 --> 01:09:42,904
Who are you?

637
01:09:43,454 --> 01:09:44,944
Talent scout.

638
01:09:45,624 --> 01:09:46,894
Come in.

639
01:09:47,454 --> 01:09:50,534
I don't just light trees.
I'm an actress as well.

640
01:09:52,964 --> 01:09:55,874
What is that thing?
A camera or something?

641
01:09:56,554 --> 01:09:57,874
Say, "Cheese! "

642
01:09:59,634 --> 01:10:00,624
Cheese.

643
01:10:12,314 --> 01:10:13,564
Thanks, Alfred.

644
01:10:15,494 --> 01:10:17,734
I'm sure he's wonderful company...

645
01:10:17,904 --> 01:10:21,654
...but doesn't the "gold-plated-bachelor" bit
get a little stale?

646
01:10:22,914 --> 01:10:26,244
A lot like the "lonely-secretary" syndrome,
I guess.

647
01:10:26,834 --> 01:10:28,664
Executive Assistant.

648
01:10:28,924 --> 01:10:29,914
Sorry.

649
01:10:33,264 --> 01:10:34,584
Secretary.

650
01:10:39,104 --> 01:10:40,674
Any girlfriend?

651
01:10:43,524 --> 01:10:44,684
Sure.

652
01:10:45,944 --> 01:10:47,974
You mean, as in serious?

653
01:10:49,274 --> 01:10:51,144
No. Had one, didn't work.

654
01:10:51,534 --> 01:10:53,644
What went wrong? Hang on!

655
01:10:53,864 --> 01:10:55,274
I think I know!

656
01:10:55,784 --> 01:10:57,444
You kept things from her.

657
01:10:57,534 --> 01:10:59,154
I told her everything.

658
01:11:00,374 --> 01:11:02,034
The truth frightened her?

659
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:04,114
There are two truths...

660
01:11:05,964 --> 01:11:07,284
...you know?

661
01:11:07,634 --> 01:11:11,044
She had trouble reconciling them
because I had trouble...

662
01:11:12,384 --> 01:11:13,964
...reconciling them.

663
01:11:17,974 --> 01:11:19,224
Vicki thought...

664
01:11:19,314 --> 01:11:20,304
Vicki?

665
01:11:21,484 --> 01:11:23,304
Ice skater or stewardess?

666
01:11:25,484 --> 01:11:27,814
No, she was a photojournalist.

667
01:11:29,074 --> 01:11:31,064
Was Vicki right about your...

668
01:11:31,244 --> 01:11:33,064
...difficulty with duality?

669
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:38,324
You see...

670
01:11:39,254 --> 01:11:41,284
...if I say yes, then...

671
01:11:43,004 --> 01:11:45,164
...you'll think of me as a...

672
01:11:45,344 --> 01:11:48,124
...Norman Bates, a Ted Bundy type and...

673
01:11:56,524 --> 01:11:58,514
You might not let me kiss you.

674
01:12:01,364 --> 01:12:04,684
It's the so-called normal guys
who always let you down.

675
01:12:04,864 --> 01:12:08,024
Sickos never scare me.
At least they're committed.

676
01:12:48,164 --> 01:12:49,494
I can't do that.

677
01:12:49,664 --> 01:12:50,904
Neither can I.

678
01:12:51,044 --> 01:12:54,664
This is a special bulletin.
The Ice Princess has been kidnapped.

679
01:12:55,754 --> 01:12:59,964
Can you confirm reports of Batman's
suspected involvement in the abduction?

680
01:13:01,014 --> 01:13:03,754
The evidence is purely circumstantial.

681
01:13:04,144 --> 01:13:08,724
This was found, stained with blood,
in the missing girl's dressing room.

682
01:13:10,314 --> 01:13:12,714
- I must go.
- No, it's your house.

683
01:13:13,154 --> 01:13:16,684
Hold on. Just sit for a second and relax.
I'll be right back.

684
01:13:27,464 --> 01:13:29,664
I've got to go to the plaza.

685
01:13:29,844 --> 01:13:33,124
- He is begging me to show.
- I hoped you'd snub him.

686
01:13:33,304 --> 01:13:36,874
I can't. There's been a kidnapping.
Here's what I want you to do.

687
01:13:36,974 --> 01:13:37,964
Shit!

688
01:13:41,814 --> 01:13:44,974
Tell Selina, Ms. Kyle,
I had to go out of town.

689
01:13:46,194 --> 01:13:49,764
Tell her that a big business deal came up...
You know what?

690
01:13:50,324 --> 01:13:53,894
Let her know, not in some kind of dumb,
"be-my-girlfriend" way...

691
01:13:53,994 --> 01:13:55,814
I'll relay the message.

692
01:14:00,834 --> 01:14:03,454
Mr. Wayne told me to tell you that...

693
01:14:03,834 --> 01:14:05,244
Bruce, yes...

694
01:14:06,544 --> 01:14:08,414
Would you tell him...

695
01:14:08,674 --> 01:14:12,004
...l've been going through...
a lot of changes and...

696
01:14:14,014 --> 01:14:15,464
Just that...

697
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:17,674
...this is not a rejection...

698
01:14:18,184 --> 01:14:19,884
...my abruptly leaving.

699
01:14:20,024 --> 01:14:22,424
In fact, he makes me feel the way...

700
01:14:23,024 --> 01:14:24,854
...I hope I really am.

701
01:14:26,574 --> 01:14:30,194
Could you just make up a sonnet or...
a dirty limerick?

702
01:14:30,864 --> 01:14:33,024
One has just sprung to mind.

703
01:14:34,374 --> 01:14:35,904
This way, ma'am.

704
01:15:37,154 --> 01:15:38,724
Ladies and Gentlemen.

705
01:15:38,994 --> 01:15:41,524
Please, may I have your attention?

706
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:46,194
I know that to many of you...

707
01:15:46,494 --> 01:15:49,574
...Gotham seems a bit
beleaguered these days.

708
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:52,814
But I want you to know
your elected officials...

709
01:15:52,924 --> 01:15:54,994
...and your police department...

710
01:15:55,094 --> 01:15:57,654
...have the situation well in hand.

711
01:16:58,164 --> 01:16:59,234
Got to hurry.

712
01:16:59,334 --> 01:17:00,244
Thank you.

713
01:17:00,334 --> 01:17:02,154
It was set up to look like I did it.

714
01:17:02,254 --> 01:17:05,874
I'll tell the police I was kidnapped
by an ugly birdman with fish breath.

715
01:17:05,964 --> 01:17:07,624
Did somebody say fish?

716
01:17:07,884 --> 01:17:10,044
I haven't been fed all day.

717
01:17:10,884 --> 01:17:12,254
Eat floor.

718
01:17:13,804 --> 01:17:14,964
High fiber.

719
01:17:16,144 --> 01:17:17,464
Hey, stud...

720
01:17:17,644 --> 01:17:20,884
...I thought we had something together.
- We do.

721
01:17:36,874 --> 01:17:38,784
Got to go. Girl talk.

722
01:18:07,204 --> 01:18:10,864
She let me go. I think 'cause I reasoned
with her, girl-to-girl.

723
01:18:12,664 --> 01:18:14,704
Be careful. Don't move.

724
01:18:17,044 --> 01:18:18,414
Lawn dart!

725
01:18:22,514 --> 01:18:24,714
Rats with wings, do your thing.

726
01:18:31,234 --> 01:18:33,054
Batman pushed the Princess!

727
01:18:48,714 --> 01:18:49,984
Hold your fire!

728
01:19:05,024 --> 01:19:07,414
You're catnip to a girl like me.

729
01:19:08,694 --> 01:19:10,434
Handsome, dazed...

730
01:19:11,864 --> 01:19:13,604
...and to die for.

731
01:19:21,534 --> 01:19:24,024
Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it.

732
01:19:24,794 --> 01:19:26,284
But a kiss...

733
01:19:26,624 --> 01:19:29,194
...can be even deadlier if you mean it.

734
01:19:38,644 --> 01:19:41,554
You're the second man
who's killed me this week.

735
01:19:41,724 --> 01:19:43,724
But I've got seven lives left.

736
01:19:43,894 --> 01:19:45,344
I tried to save you...

737
01:19:45,444 --> 01:19:48,604
Seems like every woman
you try to save ends up dead.

738
01:19:48,984 --> 01:19:50,814
Or deeply resentful.

739
01:19:51,824 --> 01:19:53,734
Maybe you should retire.

740
01:20:16,724 --> 01:20:17,884
Damn.

741
01:20:53,064 --> 01:20:54,514
Outstanding!

742
01:20:55,234 --> 01:20:57,554
You're Beauty and the Beast...

743
01:20:58,064 --> 01:21:00,854
...in one luscious Christmas gift pack.

744
01:21:02,074 --> 01:21:04,474
You said you'd scare the Ice Princess.

745
01:21:04,574 --> 01:21:06,734
She looked pretty scared to me.

746
01:21:09,084 --> 01:21:10,904
A touch of the bubbly?

747
01:21:14,834 --> 01:21:16,914
So what are we waiting for?

748
01:21:17,134 --> 01:21:19,744
Let's consummate our fiendish union.

749
01:21:20,594 --> 01:21:21,754
What?

750
01:21:22,264 --> 01:21:23,714
Oh, come on.

751
01:21:24,264 --> 01:21:25,844
Can't you picture?

752
01:21:26,014 --> 01:21:28,174
It's dark in the mayor's mansion.

753
01:21:28,564 --> 01:21:31,804
I'm bushed, so here you come
into the bedroom...

754
01:21:33,024 --> 01:21:35,104
...twitching your little tail...

755
01:21:35,274 --> 01:21:38,604
...my slippers in one hand,
a dry martini in the other.

756
01:21:38,864 --> 01:21:39,934
Please.

757
01:21:40,454 --> 01:21:42,564
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.

758
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:46,984
You lousy minx! I should have you spayed!
You sent out all the signals!

759
01:21:47,624 --> 01:21:50,104
I don't think I like you anymore!

760
01:21:58,134 --> 01:22:00,174
Good-bye, my unintended.

761
01:22:00,684 --> 01:22:01,954
Go to heaven.

762
01:23:01,664 --> 01:23:02,854
There he is!

763
01:23:05,504 --> 01:23:07,244
Don't adjust your sets.

764
01:23:07,464 --> 01:23:08,744
Welcome...

765
01:23:09,014 --> 01:23:12,084
...to the Oswald Cobblepot
School of Driving.

766
01:23:13,474 --> 01:23:15,874
Gentlemen, start your screaming.

767
01:23:50,014 --> 01:23:54,134
This may be a bad time to mention it,
but my license has expired!

768
01:24:11,334 --> 01:24:12,324
Relax.

769
01:24:12,584 --> 01:24:16,994
I'll take care of the squealing, wretched,
pinhead puppets of Gotham!

770
01:25:03,974 --> 01:25:08,054
You must admit I played this stinking city
like a harp from hell!

771
01:25:28,294 --> 01:25:30,664
Helpless old lady at 12:00 high!

772
01:26:08,134 --> 01:26:09,374
That's funny.

773
01:26:18,144 --> 01:26:19,884
Now I'm a little worried.

774
01:26:46,804 --> 01:26:48,674
So he survived. Why worry?

775
01:26:48,844 --> 01:26:52,594
He didn't even lose a limb!
An eyeball! Bladder control!

776
01:26:53,484 --> 01:26:56,894
Listen to them. They've lost faith
in old symbols.

777
01:26:57,524 --> 01:27:00,514
They're ready to bond with you,
the icon of the future.

778
01:27:00,614 --> 01:27:02,524
If it works, don't fix it.

779
01:27:02,784 --> 01:27:05,234
We'll celebrate tonight at my annual ball.

780
01:27:05,324 --> 01:27:07,314
Shreck and Cobblepot...

781
01:27:07,954 --> 01:27:10,074
...the visionary alliance.

782
01:27:29,814 --> 01:27:31,634
When it came time...

783
01:27:31,984 --> 01:27:34,934
...to ensure the safety of our fair city...

784
01:27:36,484 --> 01:27:38,774
...did the mayor have a plan?

785
01:27:39,654 --> 01:27:40,734
No!

786
01:27:42,244 --> 01:27:44,024
He relied on a man.

787
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:47,324
A Batman.

788
01:27:48,334 --> 01:27:51,244
A ticking time-bomb of a costumed freak...

789
01:27:52,674 --> 01:27:55,664
Our prime concern is
this ghastly grotesque.

790
01:27:56,344 --> 01:27:59,504
But let's not forget about
repairing the Batmobile.

791
01:27:59,764 --> 01:28:01,714
There's security to consider.

792
01:28:02,014 --> 01:28:04,964
We can't just take it to any old body shop.

793
01:28:06,104 --> 01:28:07,184
Security?

794
01:28:07,444 --> 01:28:09,684
Who let Vicki Vale into the Batcave?

795
01:28:09,774 --> 01:28:14,104
I'm working, I turn around and there she is.
"Hi, Vick. Come on in."

796
01:28:23,544 --> 01:28:25,824
- Ready?
- I'll take the stairs.

797
01:28:47,524 --> 01:28:50,434
You ask... am I up here for personal glory?

798
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:54,064
No.

799
01:29:07,014 --> 01:29:09,754
The glory that I yearn to recapture...

800
01:29:11,014 --> 01:29:13,134
...is the glory of Gotham!

801
01:29:31,284 --> 01:29:33,574
How can this be accomplished?

802
01:29:36,004 --> 01:29:37,324
I know...

803
01:29:37,544 --> 01:29:39,574
...you're all concerned.

804
01:29:42,054 --> 01:29:43,234
Relax.

805
01:29:43,884 --> 01:29:48,294
I'll take care of the squealing, wretched,
pinhead puppets of Gotham.

806
01:29:55,774 --> 01:29:57,344
I didn't say that.

807
01:29:59,734 --> 01:30:02,814
You must admit I played
this stinking city...

808
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:05,984
...like a harp from hell!

809
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:09,154
You must admit...

810
01:30:09,334 --> 01:30:12,824
...I played this stinking city
like a harp from hell!

811
01:31:06,234 --> 01:31:10,144
Why is there always someone who brings
eggs and tomatoes to a speech?

812
01:31:34,134 --> 01:31:35,584
There he is!

813
01:32:07,174 --> 01:32:08,544
My babies.

814
01:32:09,844 --> 01:32:11,504
Did you miss me?

815
01:32:25,534 --> 01:32:27,184
Did you miss me?

816
01:32:28,864 --> 01:32:30,734
Great speech, Oswald.

817
01:32:31,994 --> 01:32:33,904
My name is not Oswald!

818
01:32:34,544 --> 01:32:36,034
It's Penguin!

819
01:32:36,334 --> 01:32:38,324
I am not a human being!

820
01:32:38,714 --> 01:32:41,034
I am an animal. Cold-blooded!

821
01:32:42,504 --> 01:32:44,084
Crank the A.C.!

822
01:32:44,304 --> 01:32:47,084
Where are my lists? Bring me the names!

823
01:32:48,144 --> 01:32:49,504
It's time.

824
01:32:49,894 --> 01:32:53,664
These are the names of the first-born sons
of Gotham City.

825
01:32:54,314 --> 01:32:55,974
Just like I was.

826
01:32:56,404 --> 01:32:59,394
And like me, a terrible fate waits for them.

827
01:33:01,234 --> 01:33:03,944
Tonight, while their parents party...

828
01:33:04,574 --> 01:33:06,904
...they'll be dreaming away...

829
01:33:07,334 --> 01:33:09,404
...in their safe cribs...

830
01:33:09,664 --> 01:33:11,534
...their soft beds...

831
01:33:11,914 --> 01:33:14,074
...and we'll snatch them...

832
01:33:14,254 --> 01:33:16,244
...carry them into the sewer...

833
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:19,704
...and toss them into a deep, dark,
watery grave.

834
01:33:21,764 --> 01:33:22,924
Penguin?

835
01:33:23,684 --> 01:33:25,924
Killing sleeping children...

836
01:33:26,264 --> 01:33:28,014
...isn't that a little...

837
01:33:38,284 --> 01:33:39,854
No, it's a lot.

838
01:33:49,834 --> 01:33:51,164
A reminder.

839
01:33:51,334 --> 01:33:55,334
Tonight is that loathsome party hosted
by the odious Mr. Shreck.

840
01:33:55,674 --> 01:33:58,504
May we RSVP
in the resoundingly negative?

841
01:33:59,224 --> 01:34:00,494
Not interested.

842
01:34:02,684 --> 01:34:03,924
Although...

843
01:34:06,274 --> 01:34:08,344
...Selina Kyle might be there.

844
01:34:31,634 --> 01:34:33,374
Ingenious costume.

845
01:34:33,804 --> 01:34:35,294
Let me guess.

846
01:34:35,474 --> 01:34:37,464
Trust-fund goody-goody?

847
01:34:38,814 --> 01:34:40,214
Feeling good?

848
01:34:41,234 --> 01:34:44,644
You almost made a monster the mayor
of Gotham City.

849
01:34:45,064 --> 01:34:47,394
I am the light of this city...

850
01:34:47,734 --> 01:34:50,224
...and I am its mean, twisted soul.

851
01:34:50,654 --> 01:34:52,394
Does it matter who's mayor?

852
01:34:52,494 --> 01:34:53,684
It does to me.

853
01:34:54,074 --> 01:34:55,234
Yawn.

854
01:35:33,544 --> 01:35:35,944
I'm sorry about yesterday, but I had...

855
01:35:36,084 --> 01:35:39,534
...a pretty big deal come through.
Fall through, actually.

856
01:35:39,714 --> 01:35:42,584
It's okay. I had to go home
and feed my cat.

857
01:35:51,564 --> 01:35:53,224
No hard feelings then?

858
01:35:55,734 --> 01:35:57,144
Actually...

859
01:35:59,274 --> 01:36:01,184
...semi-hard, I'd say.

860
01:36:07,414 --> 01:36:10,904
There's a big, comfy California King
over in Bedding.

861
01:36:12,464 --> 01:36:14,114
Why don't we...

862
01:36:15,254 --> 01:36:17,124
Take off our costumes?

863
01:36:20,634 --> 01:36:22,794
I'm tired of wearing masks.

864
01:36:23,644 --> 01:36:24,884
Me too.

865
01:36:26,314 --> 01:36:28,054
Let me ask you something.

866
01:36:29,314 --> 01:36:31,014
Why'd you come tonight?

867
01:36:31,654 --> 01:36:33,644
- You first.
- To see you.

868
01:36:36,114 --> 01:36:37,104
Lovely.

869
01:36:38,784 --> 01:36:42,024
I wish I could say the same,
but I came for Max.

870
01:36:44,994 --> 01:36:46,614
Do you mean you...

871
01:36:46,954 --> 01:36:48,324
Not you and Max?

872
01:36:49,794 --> 01:36:51,204
Me and Max?

873
01:36:57,804 --> 01:36:59,544
No. This and Max.

874
01:37:02,814 --> 01:37:06,934
Don't tell me killing Max
won't solve anything, because it will.

875
01:37:08,024 --> 01:37:11,354
Aren't you tired of this
sanctimonious robber baron...

876
01:37:11,524 --> 01:37:14,434
...coming out on top when
he should be six feet under?

877
01:37:14,534 --> 01:37:18,694
You may have problems with your boss,
but who do you think you are?

878
01:37:21,704 --> 01:37:23,954
I don't know anymore, Bruce.

879
01:37:38,474 --> 01:37:40,634
A kiss under the mistletoe.

880
01:37:43,904 --> 01:37:46,054
"Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it."

881
01:37:46,154 --> 01:37:48,394
"But a kiss can be even deadlier...

882
01:37:50,904 --> 01:37:52,444
"...if you mean it."

883
01:38:02,754 --> 01:38:04,164
Oh, my God.

884
01:38:05,094 --> 01:38:07,624
Does this mean we have to start fighting?

885
01:38:08,674 --> 01:38:10,254
Let's go outside.

886
01:38:46,134 --> 01:38:48,214
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right.

887
01:38:56,404 --> 01:38:58,304
You didn't invite me...

888
01:38:58,574 --> 01:39:00,224
...so I crashed!

889
01:39:03,784 --> 01:39:04,854
What do you want?

890
01:39:04,954 --> 01:39:06,774
Right now, my troops...

891
01:39:07,034 --> 01:39:09,284
...are fanning out across town...

892
01:39:09,544 --> 01:39:11,364
...for your children!

893
01:39:11,664 --> 01:39:12,654
Yes!

894
01:39:12,834 --> 01:39:14,914
For your first-born sons!

895
01:39:15,674 --> 01:39:18,544
The ones you left defenseless at home...

896
01:39:18,844 --> 01:39:21,164
...so you could dress up like jerks...

897
01:39:21,264 --> 01:39:23,384
...get juiced and dance...

898
01:39:24,184 --> 01:39:25,504
...badly!

899
01:39:30,104 --> 01:39:32,094
I've personally come...

900
01:39:32,694 --> 01:39:35,064
...for Gotham's favorite son...

901
01:39:35,274 --> 01:39:37,064
...Mr. Chip Shreck.

902
01:39:38,284 --> 01:39:40,984
You're coming with me,
you Great White Dope...

903
01:39:41,954 --> 01:39:44,274
...to die, way down in the sewer!

904
01:39:44,954 --> 01:39:48,734
Not Chip. If you have any human feeling,
take me instead.

905
01:39:51,044 --> 01:39:52,744
I don't. So, no!

906
01:39:53,214 --> 01:39:54,484
I'm the one you want.

907
01:39:54,594 --> 01:39:58,084
Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated
and betrayed you?

908
01:39:58,644 --> 01:40:00,714
Isn't it Max, not Chip...

909
01:40:01,314 --> 01:40:04,804
...you want to see immersed
to his eyeballs in raw sewage?

910
01:40:09,814 --> 01:40:11,564
Okay, you got a point.

911
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:14,644
I'll let the little prince live, for now.

912
01:40:14,904 --> 01:40:16,094
In the duck!

913
01:40:43,604 --> 01:40:45,764
This is going to be good...

914
01:40:46,524 --> 01:40:50,274
...to cut down a whole crop
of Gotham's most promising...

915
01:40:51,364 --> 01:40:53,024
...before their prime.

916
01:40:55,374 --> 01:40:57,934
You ask me... how do I lure them in?

917
01:41:02,084 --> 01:41:04,454
A little "Pied Penguin" action.

918
01:41:07,054 --> 01:41:09,534
And you get to watch them sink...

919
01:41:10,394 --> 01:41:12,214
...into a deep puddle...

920
01:41:12,394 --> 01:41:14,924
...of your industrial by-products.

921
01:41:15,774 --> 01:41:16,874
Then...

922
01:41:17,104 --> 01:41:18,724
...you join them.

923
01:41:52,604 --> 01:41:55,174
Hurry up and get those kids loaded.

924
01:42:04,784 --> 01:42:06,774
Right this way, kiddies.

925
01:42:07,334 --> 01:42:08,824
Come with me.

926
01:42:25,314 --> 01:42:27,634
So where are all the children?

927
01:42:31,654 --> 01:42:32,974
"Dear Penguin:

928
01:42:33,194 --> 01:42:36,314
"The children regret
they're unable to attend.

929
01:42:36,864 --> 01:42:38,184
"Batman! "

930
01:42:51,714 --> 01:42:53,494
My dear penguins...

931
01:42:54,884 --> 01:42:57,364
...we stand on a great threshold!

932
01:42:58,844 --> 01:43:00,844
It's okay to be scared!

933
01:43:01,514 --> 01:43:04,004
Many of you won't be coming back.

934
01:43:04,394 --> 01:43:06,184
Thanks to Batman...

935
01:43:06,854 --> 01:43:08,684
...the time has come...

936
01:43:08,904 --> 01:43:11,304
...to punish all God's children!

937
01:43:12,824 --> 01:43:15,694
First-, second-, third- And fourth-born!

938
01:43:16,494 --> 01:43:18,024
Why be biased?

939
01:43:18,334 --> 01:43:19,984
Male and female!

940
01:43:20,744 --> 01:43:22,994
Hell, the sexes are equal...

941
01:43:23,914 --> 01:43:26,164
...with their erogenous zones...

942
01:43:26,334 --> 01:43:28,084
...blown sky-high!

943
01:43:31,014 --> 01:43:32,164
Forward...

944
01:43:33,514 --> 01:43:34,674
...march!

945
01:43:35,094 --> 01:43:37,254
The liberation of Gotham...

946
01:43:38,434 --> 01:43:39,924
...has begun!

947
01:44:25,074 --> 01:44:27,394
The penguins are moving above ground.

948
01:44:52,774 --> 01:44:54,264
Penguin army...

949
01:44:54,444 --> 01:44:57,764
...approaching launch destination
at Gotham Plaza.

950
01:44:59,114 --> 01:45:01,234
One minute until ignition.

951
01:45:01,784 --> 01:45:04,064
They wouldn't put me on a pedestal...

952
01:45:04,244 --> 01:45:06,644
...so I'm laying them on a slab!

953
01:45:07,914 --> 01:45:10,654
Penguins seem to be converging
on Gotham Plaza.

954
01:45:33,904 --> 01:45:36,024
Thirty seconds until ignition.

955
01:45:37,994 --> 01:45:40,524
Estimated casualties after launch:

956
01:45:41,664 --> 01:45:43,234
100,000 people.

957
01:45:46,664 --> 01:45:49,454
The penguins have reached
Gotham Square.

958
01:46:08,864 --> 01:46:10,854
Fifteen seconds to ignition.

959
01:46:13,444 --> 01:46:15,144
Ready when you are, sir.

960
01:46:17,954 --> 01:46:19,694
I've got the coordinates.

961
01:46:27,544 --> 01:46:29,244
Let's turn them around.

962
01:46:37,814 --> 01:46:39,304
Something is wrong.

963
01:46:41,064 --> 01:46:43,144
Something has jammed the signal.

964
01:46:53,414 --> 01:46:55,784
They seem to be turning around.

965
01:47:26,864 --> 01:47:29,734
There is also something coming this way.

966
01:47:30,704 --> 01:47:32,694
Very large. Very fast.

967
01:47:48,974 --> 01:47:50,304
Who's there?

968
01:47:57,574 --> 01:47:59,894
I'm homing in on the signal's origin.

969
01:49:15,954 --> 01:49:19,024
You're jealous
because I'm a genuine freak...

970
01:49:19,374 --> 01:49:21,614
...and you have to wear a mask!

971
01:49:21,874 --> 01:49:23,534
You might be right.

972
01:49:26,134 --> 01:49:30,074
But what it all comes down to is:
Who's holding the umbrella?

973
01:49:56,584 --> 01:49:57,944
My babies!

974
01:51:34,654 --> 01:51:38,984
I don't know what you want,
but I can get it with a minimum of fuss.

975
01:51:41,164 --> 01:51:42,324
Money.

976
01:51:42,664 --> 01:51:43,654
Jewels.

977
01:51:43,954 --> 01:51:45,944
A very big ball of string.

978
01:51:50,424 --> 01:51:52,084
Your blood, Max.

979
01:51:52,304 --> 01:51:53,874
I gave at the office.

980
01:51:54,304 --> 01:51:56,464
A half-pint. I'm talking gallons.

981
01:51:56,844 --> 01:51:58,294
Let's make a deal!

982
01:51:58,474 --> 01:52:00,594
Other than my blood, what can I do?

983
01:52:00,684 --> 01:52:02,964
Sorry, Max. A die for a die.

984
01:52:14,204 --> 01:52:16,564
You're not just saving a life...

985
01:52:16,704 --> 01:52:18,734
Shut up. You're going to jail.

986
01:52:19,454 --> 01:52:23,704
Don't be naive. The law doesn't
apply to people like him... or us.

987
01:52:24,294 --> 01:52:25,874
Wrong on both counts.

988
01:52:35,974 --> 01:52:37,134
Why do this?

989
01:52:41,144 --> 01:52:43,304
Let's just take him to the police.

990
01:52:44,904 --> 01:52:46,604
Then we can go home...

991
01:52:47,824 --> 01:52:48,984
...together.

992
01:52:55,044 --> 01:52:56,114
Selina...

993
01:52:59,334 --> 01:53:00,994
...don't you see?

994
01:53:02,134 --> 01:53:03,404
We're the same.

995
01:53:05,844 --> 01:53:07,254
We're the same.

996
01:53:08,974 --> 01:53:10,044
Split...

997
01:53:10,474 --> 01:53:11,964
...down the center.

998
01:53:33,544 --> 01:53:34,784
Please.

999
01:53:36,044 --> 01:53:37,204
Bruce...

1000
01:53:38,044 --> 01:53:41,204
...I would love to live with you
in your castle...

1001
01:53:43,724 --> 01:53:46,464
...forever, just like in a fairy tale.

1002
01:53:52,234 --> 01:53:56,004
I just couldn't live with myself.
Don't pretend this is a happy ending.

1003
01:53:58,734 --> 01:53:59,984
Selina Kyle.

1004
01:54:01,494 --> 01:54:02,904
You're fired.

1005
01:54:03,324 --> 01:54:04,904
And Bruce Wayne...

1006
01:54:05,414 --> 01:54:07,234
...why are you dressed up like Batman?

1007
01:54:07,334 --> 01:54:09,734
Because he is Batman, you moron!

1008
01:54:11,124 --> 01:54:12,204
Was.

1009
01:54:14,794 --> 01:54:15,744
Don't.

1010
01:54:15,924 --> 01:54:19,544
You killed me, the Penguin killed me,
Batman killed me.

1011
01:54:20,094 --> 01:54:23,134
Three lives down.
Got enough to finish me off?

1012
01:54:23,224 --> 01:54:24,754
One way to find out.

1013
01:54:28,354 --> 01:54:29,344
Four.

1014
01:54:29,604 --> 01:54:30,764
Five.

1015
01:54:34,234 --> 01:54:35,424
Still alive!

1016
01:54:45,124 --> 01:54:46,204
Six.

1017
01:54:46,374 --> 01:54:47,454
Seven.

1018
01:54:47,674 --> 01:54:49,914
All good girls go to heaven.

1019
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:57,964
Two lives left.

1020
01:55:00,224 --> 01:55:02,704
I'll save one for next Christmas.

1021
01:55:05,144 --> 01:55:07,054
But in the meantime...

1022
01:55:08,904 --> 01:55:11,064
...how about a kiss, Santie Claus?

1023
01:56:42,264 --> 01:56:43,414
Shit!

1024
01:56:43,764 --> 01:56:45,584
I picked a cute one.

1025
01:56:49,104 --> 01:56:51,174
The heat's getting to me.

1026
01:56:52,104 --> 01:56:54,344
I'll murder you momentarily.

1027
01:56:56,654 --> 01:56:58,104
But first...

1028
01:56:58,864 --> 01:57:00,934
...I need a cool drink...

1029
01:57:01,654 --> 01:57:03,314
...of ice water.

1030
01:58:45,364 --> 01:58:46,684
Stop the car.

1031
02:00:07,704 --> 02:00:09,364
Come what may...

1032
02:00:09,794 --> 02:00:11,784
...Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne!

1033
02:00:12,794 --> 02:00:14,534
Merry Christmas, Alfred!

1034
02:00:16,304 --> 02:00:17,954
Goodwill toward men.

1035
02:00:20,644 --> 02:00:21,884
And women.
