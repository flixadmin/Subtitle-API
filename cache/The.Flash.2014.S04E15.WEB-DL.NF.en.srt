It's scary and alarming

967
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,248
to have this person
that you know nothing about

968
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,708
living inside of you.

969
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,336
But for the first time,

970
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,588
I remember what she did.

971
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,507
- What do you remember?

972
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,926
- Barry taking her
into Flashtime,

973
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,427
trying to freeze the bomb...
- Mm-hmm.

974
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,096
- And...

975
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:53,599
Killer Frost being...worried.

976
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,978
- Worried about...what?
About dying?

977
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,189
- About me.

978
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:00,565
- Interesting.

979
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,109
- [gasps]
- Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

980
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:04,361
I didn't mean to drop that.

981
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,362
It just slipped
out of my hands.

982
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,696
- That's okay.

983
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,114
- Oh, gosh, my first...
[laughs]

984
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:10,116
Killer Frost,
and I go and ruin it.

985
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,576
Typical...typical me.
- That's not...

986
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:12,994
- It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

987
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:14,871
- I just get so clumsy
when I'm nervous.

988
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,581
- What are you nervous about?

989
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,499
- Um, I'm...I'm supposed to be
meeting some people here

990
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,168
for the first time,
and I've got the jitters,

991
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,420
which... [laughs]
Is what this place is called.

992
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,838
- Hey! It is.

993
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,715
- Apt name, don't you think?
- I do.

994
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,175
- It's funny, you know,
you get nervous,

995
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:28,551
you get the jitters,
you go for coffee,

996
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,345
and the caffeine
acts as a stimulant,

997
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:31,888
which makes you shaky,
which could also be known as...

998
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,181
- The jitters.
- Exactly.

999
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:35,808
- [laughs]
Okay, ri...I get it.

1000
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,019
Okay.

1001
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:39,520
We're gonna go.

1002
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,773
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1003
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,524
- Um, I'm really
very, very sorry.

1004
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,151
- Don't worry about it.
Good luck with your meeting.

1005
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,153
I hope it goes well.
- Thanks.
