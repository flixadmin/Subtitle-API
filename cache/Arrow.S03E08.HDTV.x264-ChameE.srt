1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:03,702
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:05,137
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:07,639
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:09,375
To save my city.

5
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:10,809
Now others have
joined my crusade.

6
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:13,679
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

7
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,381
To the rest
of starling city,

8
00:00:15,383 --> 00:00:17,349
I am someone else.

9
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:20,119
I am something else.

10
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:22,488
Previously,
on "arrow" and "flash"...

11
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,024
Hello?
It's barry.

12
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:27,026
I woke up.
I could use some advice.

13
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:29,995
I don't think that bolt of lightning
struck you, barry.

14
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:32,197
I think it chose you.

15
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,733
You can inspire people

16
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:36,335
In a way that
I never could.

17
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:38,137
So what are you guys doing
in central city?

18
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:40,506
Working a case.
Suspicious homicide,

19
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:43,809
In a style where
the murder weapon...

20
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:45,677
Is a boomerang.

21
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,746
Partners?
Partners.

22
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:52,317
Barry has super powers, Oliver
has a bow and arrow.

23
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,586
If I had a sample I was unable
to fully break down,

24
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:57,322
Do you think you could isolate 
the genetic markings for me?

25
00:00:57,324 --> 00:01:01,126
What's the sample from?
Canary's murder.

26
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:16,675
In position?

27
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,245
In position.

28
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:24,950
In position.

29
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:26,552
Neighborhood's
clear.

30
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:28,353
You know, I probably should have 
brought this up before,

31
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:30,722
But if this place doesn't 
belong to the killer

32
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:33,358
You chased to central city
and back, well,

33
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,628
We're going to have
a lot of explaining to do.

34
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,534
It's his.

35
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,069
Why, because the residue
S.T.A.R. Labs

36
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,704
Found on the boomerang
says so?

37
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,739
Because the whole
place is rigged.

38
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:47,739
[beeping]

39
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:52,611
I can see a trip wire connected
to pressurized gas.

40
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:56,148
Front door
will be the same.

41
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:01,487
Our new friend doesn't want
any surprise visitors.

42
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:05,858
Well, he's going
to get a surprise.

43
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:35,154
Looks like
we interrupted his dinner.

44
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:37,823
We just missed him.

45
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:43,428
Drop your guns.

46
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,164
Sure thing.
Right when

47
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,598
You learn
how to count.

48
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,767
You're outnumbered,
jerkwad.

49
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:49,801
You're not scpd.

50
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,703
Unless police
uniforms have gotten

51
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:54,506
Really interesting,
neither are you.

52
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,042
A.R.G.U.S.

53
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,846
Your flanking patterns
haven't changed in years.

54
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,114
Why is a.R.G.U.S.
In on this?

55
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:04,449
The man who was killed
by the boomerang...

56
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,185
He was an a.R.G.U.S. Agent?

57
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,787
Which makes this
an A.R.G.U.S. Matter.

58
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:12,257
Bug out.
Target's not here.

59
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,866
Let this go.

60
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,570
Are we going
to let this go?

61
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:27,639
What do you think?

62
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:36,815
What about this
a.R.G.U.S. Angle?

63
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:40,686
Oh, well, a.R.G.U.S.
Wiped all evidence
of their agent's death

64
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:43,989
After he was killed, or at least 
they thought they did.

65
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,924
Our boomerang victim,
kai wu.

66
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:49,161
The man's profile is so clean, I should 
have known it was an A.R.G.U.S. Cover.

67
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:50,729
Well, now that we know
wu is A.R.G.U.S.,

68
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:50,729
Maybe lyla
can get us a lead?

69
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:54,766
If this an a.R.G.U.S. Thing, Lyla's 
going to want it to stay that way.

70
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:58,904
Then tell her to stop letting people 
get killed in my city.

71
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,507
You really don't care
about my marriage, do you?

72
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,243
Well, I would...

73
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:07,512
If you and Lyla
were still married.

74
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,751
Thank you
for coming.

75
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,186
Like I had a choice.

76
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:16,421
I see you made a new friend.

77
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,023
This is katsu cheng.

78
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,524
Mr. Cheng
fancies himself

79
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:22,027
Something of a munitions
specialist.

80
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:22,027
According to HKPF,

81
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:26,231
Cheng planted an explosive device
somewhere in hong kong,

82
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:29,368
I need you to talk to him,
find out the bomb's location.

83
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,702
So I'm just going
to talk to him

84
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:33,071
And he's going to
give me information?

85
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,207
It won't be easy.

86
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:38,610
That's why I brought you
your tools.

87
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,213
What tools?

88
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:44,249
We recovered these
from the freighter

89
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:46,485
When we recovered you.

90
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:47,452
You're welcome.

91
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,955
You want me
to torture this guy

92
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,256
To find out
where the bomb is?

93
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:53,659
I want you to find out
where the bomb is.

94
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:57,963
How you do so
is of little interest to me.

95
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,106
[door opens]

96
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,309
Almost done here,
jerry.

97
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:12,344
You should have
gone home hours ago.

98
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:13,312
Caitlin:
Who's jerry?

99
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:15,514
This place is bigger
than my apartment.

100
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,149
What are you guys
doing here?

101
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:19,484
You asked us to analyze the DNA
off the arrow

102
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,786
That killed Sara.

103
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:23,088
I was just going
to mail you the sample.

104
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,090
We had some vacation
days coming--

105
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:27,592
We want to see the arrow cave.

106
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:30,662
We don't call it that.

107
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:32,698
Ever.

108
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,966
I want to see
the toys!

109
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:38,003
I need to see
the toys.

110
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:41,206
Do you guys have
an arrowmobile?

111
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,012
Don't touch that.

112
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,548
Or that.

113
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,651
It's a jettisoning arrow.
Uses compressed co2--

114
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:54,686
Compressed co2 to jettison
high tensile

115
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,621
Strength polymer cables.
Yep.

116
00:05:56,623 --> 00:06:00,225
Since when did we start selling 
admission the the arrow cave?

117
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:01,526
It's...

118
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,196
Do you see what you've done?

119
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,132
Incredible.

120
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:11,036
I have so many ideas
for improvements.

121
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,572
And this. Oh, oh, man!

122
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:13,572
This--this is the bomb.

123
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:18,176
And I mean, red is so much cooler 
than green, am I right?

124
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,379
Hmm. I am really starting
to like this guy.

125
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:22,814
Hey, what's that for?

126
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:24,850
[sighs]

127
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:26,485
Distracting me
from work.

128
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:28,153
So where's mr. Diggle?

129
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,489
He's running down a lead.

130
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,560
We have this
handled, johnny.

131
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,561
I told oliver that already.

132
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,897
Seriously. It's an internal
A.R.G.U.S. Matter.

133
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,233
I told him that, too.
Listen, sweetie,

134
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,868
A guy who kills
with boomerangs?

135
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,237
That's a little outside
you guys' wheelhouse.

136
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:48,106
While exotic killers
are more...

137
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,574
Our thing.

138
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:54,246
You only call me "sweetie" when
you want something.

139
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:57,082
Is it working?

140
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,932
[beeping]

141
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,869
Hang on a second.

142
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,071
Is there a problem?

143
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,406
Something strange
with your id.

144
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:23,875
I'm going to have to detain you
for a minute.

145
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:23,875
Hmm.

146
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:28,313
If that's a problem,
I really don't care.

147
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:30,782
You know,

148
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:34,119
You should how you treat
people, my friend.

149
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,321
After all...

150
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,063
What goes around,
comes around.

151
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,573
[beeping]

152
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,743
I appreciate
the offer, johnny,

153
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:02,247
But really,
we have it handled.

154
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:03,849
[alarm sounding]

155
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:07,118
Is that your
"we have it handled" alarm?

156
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,155
[alarm continues]

157
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:20,131
We have a breach.
Initiate lockdown protocols.

158
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,868
[cell phone vibrates]
diggle.

159
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,536
We have a bit
of a situation here.

160
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,505
Our man's at A.R.G.U.S.
Lyla's here.

161
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:29,174
Oliver, this guy?
He's the real deal.

162
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:33,445
Our target is storming A.R.G.U.S.
And Lyla is there.

163
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:37,382
Cisco: Mm-hmm. Bad ass.

164
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:38,350
So cool!

165
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,285
It'll be over by the time
they get there.

166
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:43,622
[alarm continues]

167
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:02,340
Sweetie...

168
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:07,579
You only call me "sweetie" 
when you want something.

169
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,683
No, chase, just
because we kiss,

170
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:48,420
It doesn't mean
anything, ok?

171
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,195
[sirens in distance]

172
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,263
Are you sure
you're ok?

173
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,298
What was that?
A better question--

174
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,466
Who attacked you?

175
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:12,337
And don't tell him it was an 
internal A.R.G.U.S. Matter.

176
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,540
His name is Digger Harkness.

177
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:15,540
Former asis.

178
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:20,378
His specialty is weapons and 
technology before he went rogue.

179
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,348
Started selling his services
to the highest bidder.

180
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,183
We caught him three years ago.

181
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,284
Well, looks like
he escaped.

182
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:28,553
Not exactly.
Harkness' skills

183
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:31,556
Made him an ideal recruit
for task force x.

184
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,158
You mean the suicide squad.

185
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,527
They had an op in tanzania.

186
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,129
Assassination
of a local warlord.

187
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,165
But the warlord
had bigger guns.

188
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,700
The mission went south...

189
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:43,368
And the team
had to be sanitized.

190
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,570
You mean killed, Lyla.

191
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:50,775
Waller couldn't be reached.
It was my call.

192
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,345
The micro bomb in Harkness' neck
must have malfunctioned.

193
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:58,016
We need to consider that every 
A.R.G.U.S. Facility is compromised.

194
00:11:58,018 --> 00:12:02,721
There's only one place
we can keep you safe.

195
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,092
How often does
oliver do this?

196
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:09,027
Felicity:
At least every Wednesday.

197
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:12,330
There's a lot of sweating.

198
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,738
I don't see what's
so hard about that.

199
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,940
I'm not sure
she should have called you.

200
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:24,209
Oliver doesn't
play well with others.

201
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:27,545
Ah, come on. Barry and oliver
kicked ass last week.

202
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:28,713
Yeah!

203
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:31,216
They were in, like...
A league of their own.

204
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:33,918
Yeah, that was, like,
a one time thing.

205
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,287
The dude was tossing around 
exploding boomerangs.

206
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,256
They needed
some back-up.

207
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,591
And I need some dinner.

208
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,093
That salmon ladder made me hungry
for sushi.

209
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,597
And I need to get
some paperweights down here!

210
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,599
Caitlin: I should have
warned you about that.

211
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,168
Yeah.

212
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,070
Are you ok?

213
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:53,471
Can't work
for A.R.G.U.S.

214
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:54,773
Without making
a few enemies.

215
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:58,309
I'm sorry to involve
all of you in this.

216
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:01,112
Is that A.R.G.U.S.
Property?

217
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,048
It's evidence.

218
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,586
Hey!

219
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:10,922
Secret identity?

220
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,991
They're married.

221
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,425
Both: We're not married.

222
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:15,293
Or together.
Whatever.

223
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,963
He told her about me.
You didn't?

224
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,665
I keep secrets
for a living, man.

225
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,500
Ah.

226
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:23,802
My bad.

227
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,937
You're--you're--

228
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,739
The flash. Sushi?

229
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:31,643
We need a location on the man
who's after Lyla.

230
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:32,911
His name is Digger Harkness.

231
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:34,512
The first step is
to work the evidence--

232
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:38,483
Barry, can I speak
to you for a moment, please?

233
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,957
I appreciate your help back
at A.R.G.U.S.,

234
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,025
But we have this handled.

235
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:49,160
You don't want
to team up again?

236
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,461
Things work differently here.

237
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,963
Starling city is meaner.

238
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:53,998
I seem to remember helping you 
pretty good last year,

239
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,867
And that was without powers.

240
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:56,801
I've been practicing

241
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:57,936
Everything you taught me.

242
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,504
I'm--I'm casing
new environments;

243
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,674
I'm not running in blind.

244
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,008
[exhales]

245
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,677
We do this my way.

246
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,111
Yes! This is
going to be awesome.

247
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,947
Ok, what's
our first move?

248
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:10,515
We need to reassemble
the evidence.

249
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,918
It will take some time,
but it'll--

250
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,895
But it'll be worth it.

251
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:24,996
Rad!

252
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,464
These are a bit more
teched out

253
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:27,632
Than the one you guys brought
to central city.

254
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:30,501
3D printed polymer with
a circuitry weave.

255
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,737
Some of harkness'
boomerangs exploded.

256
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,138
Oh, yeah, there are
grooves in here

257
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,707
That could definitely
pack a C4 charge.

258
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,542
Maybe if we figure out where 
Harkness got the supplies,

259
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,244
We can use that
to track him.

260
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:42,313
These weren't made
by ka-boom-boomerang?

261
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:42,313
Ka-boom-boomerang?

262
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:45,717
Yeah, you know, he has
exploding boomerangs?

263
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,652
That's not your best.

264
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,721
Really? It makes
perfect sense--
cisco.

265
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,490
If harkness didn't make them,
we need to find out who did.

266
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,158
And who he made
the buy off of.

267
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,593
Marcos. You see

268
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:56,594
This collapsible
node design?

269
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,563
Dead giveaway.
That's his signature.

270
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,665
We need a location
on this...

271
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:03,401
Klaus marcos.

272
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,372
No known home address
or place of employment

273
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:09,607
For Marcos.
But he was arrested

274
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:13,578
Last year by
an officer quentin lance.

275
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,346
Dad, I absolutely
understand,

276
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,882
But my boss wants answers on
what the department is doing

277
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,851
About the rash of b&es
on the south side.

278
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:21,920
Well, you can tell'em 
I got a whole squad on it,

279
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,955
But it can only
move so fast!

280
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:25,590
Hey, Laurel,
detective--

281
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,091
Captain. Cap--
captain. Sorry.

282
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,960
Don't worry about it.
It's been a while.

283
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,128
Is everything ok?

284
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,629
Oh, it's fine.
This is, uh,

285
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:34,565
Ah, bart allen, right? 
You get hit by a bus or something?

286
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,534
Barry. It was lightning.

287
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:40,605
Huh. Ow. We worked together on 
a case last year.

288
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:41,706
Barry's a friend.
He's in town

289
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,241
With the central city police
department

290
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:46,611
And I was hoping that you could
help with...

291
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,780
He'll explain.

292
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:48,780
Sure.

293
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,749
Oliver, can I talk
to you for a moment?

294
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,117
Yeah.

295
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:56,654
The arrow was in central city.

296
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:57,922
This is a follow-up.

297
00:15:57,924 --> 00:15:58,923
Kind of.

298
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:01,426
I'm looking to
track down a suspect

299
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:03,728
You apprehended last
year--klaus markos.

300
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,229
You know where we might be able
to find him?

301
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:07,498
None of his last knowns
are checking out.

302
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,100
Well, I don't
really keep up on

303
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,102
On the skels I busted
walking the beat, you know?

304
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,937
I'm not real sentimental
that way.

305
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,138
Ok. Uh,

306
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,674
What did you
arrest him for?

307
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:18,609
Urmm...

308
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:18,609
Identity theft.

309
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:22,180
He was using some gizmo
to steal credit card numbers

310
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:25,483
For the bratva.
Russian mob.

311
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,019
Ok.

312
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,623
I cannot believe you're a member
of the russian mob!

313
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,792
Former member, probably.

314
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:36,627
We had a falling out last year.

315
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:39,530
This is where they run
their cyber crime operation.

316
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:40,865
Hey, nice outfit,
by the way.

317
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,534
This place
looks like a fortress.

318
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,036
Kalishnikovs everywhere.

319
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:47,171
Roy, take
the southeast corner.

320
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,806
Barry, scan the perimeter.

321
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,641
Dig--
I've got northwest.

322
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,443
Are you going to be ok?

323
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:56,080
You think I'll lose it because 
Harkness is after Lyla?

324
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,384
I'm good.

325
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,435
I had eight seconds to kill.

326
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,207
Was that wrong?

327
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,578
What?

328
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:35,253
My friend wants to have
a conversation with you.

329
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,989
[groaning and grunting]

330
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:40,324
You made this
for Digger Harkness.

331
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,827
I want to know where he is.

332
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,495
Go to hell.

333
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:45,997
[groaning and grunting]

334
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:50,334
The only thing that hurts worse
than an arrow going in

335
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,769
Is an arrow coming out!

336
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,237
Whoa, hey, what are you doing?!

337
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,773
Getting information!
Where is he?!

338
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:56,841
I don't know!

339
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:58,209
He said he doesn't know!

340
00:17:58,211 --> 00:17:59,210
He's lying. If you want

341
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:01,779
To be able to raise
your arm again,

342
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,915
Tell me where he is!

343
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:07,351
Here! Harkness gave it to me.
It's encrypted.

344
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:08,753
I had an order
ready for him.

345
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,955
I called,
he came.

346
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,024
I don't know where he is,
I swear.

347
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,960
I swear!

348
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,747
Felicity can crack
the encryption.

349
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:39,784
Use this to track
down harkness.

350
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,919
You tortured that guy.

351
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,821
I interrogated him.

352
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,056
[scoffs]

353
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:47,058
When my friend said your tactics
made you a criminal,

354
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,828
I defended you because I thought 
you were supposed to be a hero.

355
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,765
I thought we were supposed to be
better than them.

356
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,067
Barry...

357
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,935
You live in central city,

358
00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:59,637
Where it's sunny
all the time

359
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,839
And your enemies
get cute nicknames.

360
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:04,842
You're not in
central city.

361
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:05,943
Yeah.

362
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:06,744
I live in a city

363
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,079
Where my best friend
was murdered,

364
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:10,515
Where a woman that I loved was 
shot full of arrows

365
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:12,316
And sent tumbling
off a rooftop.

366
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,952
Where my mother was murdered 
right in front of me.

367
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,854
So before you--
my mother was murdered

368
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:19,257
In front of me, too.

369
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:21,425
But I don't use
my personal tragedies

370
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:24,929
As an excuse to just torture
whoever pisses me off.

371
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,330
Well, I'm sorry,
barry,

372
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:30,001
I'm not as emotionally
healthy as you are.

373
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,869
What's wrong
with you?!

374
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,638
When we agreed
that you were staying,

375
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,940
We decided that
it would be on my terms.

376
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:37,808
If that is proving
too difficult for you,

377
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,078
You know your way
back to central city.

378
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:01,532
Everything
all right between
you and speedy?

379
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,867
What? Roy?

380
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,468
Yeah, we're fine.

381
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,870
I meant him.

382
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:06,971
Oh.

383
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:06,971
We had a...

384
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:11,909
Difference of opinion about 
the way the world works.

385
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:11,909
Yep.

386
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:13,678
I know what
that's like.

387
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,147
Well, sometimes
they don't see it.

388
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:17,982
There are people in the world 
who deal only in extremes--

389
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:22,820
And it would be naive to think that 
anything less than extreme measures

390
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,055
Will stop them.

391
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,023
Sometimes bravery
isn't enough.

392
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:29,026
Sometimes the world requires
us to be bold.

393
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,429
Whatever the personal cost.

394
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:32,763
Felicity: I got him.

395
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:36,767
He's in a warehouse at the corner of
infantino and adams.

396
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,736
Is that--
A.R.G.U.S. Spy satellite?

397
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,938
Yeah. Maybe.

398
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,040
Thermographic imaging
shows ten bodies inside.

399
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,675
Harkness knows we're coming.

400
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:47,078
I can track the cell phone's
position with this.

401
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,014
Cisco, you're
with Diggle and Roy.

402
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:54,819
I'll race you there.

403
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,725
Where's the bomb?

404
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,293
[speaking chinese]

405
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:03,861
My chinese sucks.

406
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:06,631
But that doesn't sound like
a location.

407
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:08,933
[grunting]

408
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:14,905
Last chance.

409
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:17,975
Your hands are shaking.

410
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,044
I knew.

411
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:22,413
You don't have it in you.

412
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:25,650
You've killed,
but torture is different.

413
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:28,753
For those with a conscience,
inflicting pain

414
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:31,722
Is more difficult
than inflicting death.

415
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:34,125
I'll figure it out.
No, you won't.

416
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,294
You don't have
the stomach for it.

417
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:39,030
I do.

418
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:43,968
To save all those
people, I do.

419
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,637
Where's the bomb?

420
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,141
Where's the bomb?!

421
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:53,077
[explosions]

422
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:12,863
You ok?

423
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,332
My daughter's mother tried
to detonate a bomb

424
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:18,169
In a man's head and now he's
trying to kill her.

425
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:19,437
So that would be a no.

426
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,138
Look, you don't know
me that well.

427
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,808
But I'm the type of guy who's only 
thought about one thing--

428
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:27,011
How do I keep the people
I love safe?

429
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,780
Well, you seem to me
to be pretty good at that.

430
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:30,881
Maybe before.

431
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:32,049
I remember a world
where people

432
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,552
Didn't kill each other
with boomerangs.

433
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:36,821
Or walk on water?

434
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:38,189
Barry can run on water.

435
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,491
You guys, harkness
has been around

436
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:42,159
Long before
people like barry.

437
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:43,494
I mean, this world was crazy

438
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:46,731
Before all these meta-humans
and super powers, right?

439
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:48,999
What's--what's your point?

440
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,568
Well, maybe meta-humans

441
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,003
And superpowers
were given to us

442
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:55,039
To deal with the crazy.

443
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,208
You mean by god?

444
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,576
No. By a dark matter wave

445
00:22:58,578 --> 00:23:02,046
Released from a failed
particle accelerated reaction.

446
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:04,682
Either way, I think

447
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:08,085
People like barry
are the hope

448
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:09,920
For saving people like us.

449
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:12,089
People like your wife
and daughter.

450
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:14,425
She's not his wife.
She's not my wife.

451
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:15,760
Ok.

452
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:19,830
Anyway, you see
my point, right?

453
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:22,199
Plus, you got to admit,

454
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:25,970
It's all pretty
freakin' cool, right?

455
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,185

[men groaning]

457
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:46,157
You're late.

458
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:52,797
I knew he was there.

459
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:57,301
He's not dead,
right?

460
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:58,436
Tranq arrow.

461
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,571
Same thing I used
on you in central city.

462
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:02,473
Cisco has the van running.

463
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:04,475
I see you met
harkness' hired muscle.

464
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:06,076
Harkness isn't here.

465
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:07,645
Hey!

466
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:09,814
Where's digger harkness?

467
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:11,315
Never met 'em.

468
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:14,852
But he paid us 10 gs
to give you this.

469
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:19,256
Ten'll get you twenty
this belongs to harkness.

470
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:20,791
What does that mean?

471
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:23,961
That harkness played you.

472
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,000
[beep] I swear I turned
that off.

473
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:31,435
What?
Marko's phone.

474
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:33,170
I shut it down
after I decrypted it.

475
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:35,105
Did someone turn it
back on remotely?

476
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:36,841
And back trace
the trace?

477
00:24:36,843 --> 00:24:39,477
We have to get
out of here now!

478
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,116
Hello, lyla.

479
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:49,753
It's been
a long time.

You had a bomb in
the back of my head.

I've got her

But I can't operate

508
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:55,446
She was a student at the 
university of hong kong.

00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:57,081
A biology textbook
in her backpack.

510
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,316
Apparently she was studying
to become a veterinarian.

He would have told me.
I just needed more time.

512
00:27:01,554 --> 00:27:04,421
No, mr. Queen, what you needed
was conviction.

513
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:06,624
And the men who do things like
this have it.

514
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:07,625
Tonight you didn't.

515
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:09,760
I thought I could--
you thought what?

516
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:11,629
You could
reason with him?

517
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:13,797
Look around you, mr. Queen.

518
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,433
Look around and tell me
that the men

519
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:19,603
Who do this type of thing
understand reason.

520
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:21,972
There are people
in this world

521
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,674
Who deal only
in extremes.

522
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:26,777
It's naive to think
that anything less

523
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,679
Than extreme measures
will stop it.

524
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:31,148
The bomber was katsu cheng.

525
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,349
But make no
mistake...

This blood

Cheng said I didn't have
the stomach for torture.

528
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,355
He was right!

529
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:41,291
Because you need
to practice.

530
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:43,994
Torture
is an art form.

531
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,463
It's a skill
one must cultivate.

532
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:49,266
How do I do that?
I think cheng was wrong.

533
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:52,369
I think you not only have 
the stomach for this work;

You have the talent.

He made that pretty clear.

We haven't been

555
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:52,496
It's all been a game. We give 
the bad guys code names.

556
00:28:52,498 --> 00:28:55,165
I think the fact we go
up against meta-humans

557
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,366
Made it all
kind of clean.

558
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:59,069
Like, the fact that
they've got these powers

559

they're doing less...

I get the feeling you don't
say that very often.

To do what I do, barry,
it takes...Conviction.

That's--
that's what's wrong,

Because the part
that I'm trading away

Look,

00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:29,860
You've convinced yourself

582
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:32,462
That everything
you've been through

583
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:33,864
Took away your humanity.

584
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:35,866
But I think it's because
of your humanity

585
00:30:35,868 --> 00:30:37,334
That you made it through.

It's a transmitter.

Barry, if you try
to defuse the bomb,

633
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:37,814
The secondary trigger's
going to transmit a signal

634
00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:39,116
And the rest of the bombs
are going to explode.

You have to defuse all the bombs
at the same time.

00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:06,810
Why are you hesitating?

645
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:39,342
Whoa!

646
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:51,788
Ten more seconds.

647
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,691
We should be able
to see at least, ah,

648
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:58,128
Three explosions
from here.

649
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,397
Ok.

650
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:03,433
Everyone has
to cut their wire

651
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:06,169
Exactly on three.

652
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:09,906
1, 2,

653
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:11,842
3!

654
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,216
[exhales]

655
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:23,019
Screw you,
captain boomerang.

656
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,930
You think you've accomplished
something here?

657
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:37,934
You think you not killing me
makes you strong?

658
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:40,237
It just means...

659
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,839
You're weak.

660
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:48,211
It means I have
some humanity left.

661
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,185
[groaning]

662
00:35:56,287 --> 00:36:00,157
You just couldn't
resist, could you?

663
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:23,813
Hey, sweetie.

664
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:29,186
You only call me "sweetie" when
you want something.

665
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:32,122
I do.

666
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,197
I want you
to marry me.

667
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:44,868
I can't believe
I waited this long to ask.

668
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,470
I need you,
Lyla.

669
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:50,540
Now, forever, official.

670
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:51,641
I need you.

671
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:54,978
Will you please
stop talking...

672
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,882
So I can say yes?

673
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:05,388
[both moaning]

674
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,696
Some of the str markers
on the dna sample

675
00:37:12,698 --> 00:37:15,065
Have degraded, but I've got 
a computer back at the lab

676
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:17,734
That I think will
help fill in the gaps.

677
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:18,902
Thank you,
caitlin.

678
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:21,504
I'll let you know as soon as 
I have the results.

679
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:23,373
I'll call this time.

680
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:24,374
Roy: It's cool.

681
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:25,942
You guys are fun.
So are you guys.

682
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:28,411
Well, you could be
if you realized

683
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:30,914
You were working
under a nightclub.

684
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:34,184
Oh, did you guys
take care of business?

685
00:37:34,186 --> 00:37:36,186
Digger harkness
is now cell mates

686
00:37:36,188 --> 00:37:37,554
With one
slade wilson.

687
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:42,058
We've got a pipeline, he's got 
a gorgeous tropical island.

688
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,226
With landmines.

689
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:44,894
Caitlin: Hmm?
What?

690
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:47,797
It's a long story.

691
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,200
What's this?

692
00:37:50,202 --> 00:37:52,302
Oliver helped me
put that in while

693
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:54,904
You guys were
at the hospital.

694
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:56,940
Wait, this
is for me?

695
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:59,909
For the next time
you're in town.

696
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:01,911
There'll be
a next time?

697
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:03,413
I'm still calling the shots.

698
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:05,715
We'll talk about that.
Yes, we will.

699
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:08,618
And then I'll call the shots.

700
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,087
We got a gift
for you, too, oliver.

701
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:12,455
Early christmas present.

702
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:15,158
Turns out S.T.A.R. Labs'
industrial fabricator

703
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,494
Was based out
of starling, so...

704
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:19,095
Polymer kevlar weave.

705
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:22,065
It's 25% lighter and 
can carry 15% more gear.

706
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:26,803
I've got designs I'm working up that
I'm really excited by.

707
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,571
It's, uh,
it's subtle.

708
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,507
I wanted
to replace the hood,

709
00:38:30,509 --> 00:38:35,145
But, uh, felicity said it had
sentimental value.

710
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:39,482
Thank you.
Any time.

711
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:40,684
You guys headed back?

712
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:42,118
It's possible

713
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,988
That dr. Wells didn't
sign off on us leaving town.

714
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,791
Hey, do you still,
like, take the train?

715
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:50,527
Yeah, sure, if I feel
like taking a nap.

716
00:38:50,529 --> 00:38:53,296
But oliver and I have
some unfinished business

717
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:54,431
To take care of first.

718
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:56,032
You guys aren't going

719
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:58,601
To punch each other,
are you?

720
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,141
Why'd you summon me here?

721
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:05,141
To make me feel worse?

722
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:09,679
No, I summoned you here to give you
a second chance.

723
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,115
Is this a joke?

724
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:12,816
No.

725
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:15,051
This is
li khuan hui.

726
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:17,387
That name should sound
familiar to you.

727
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:18,955
You work for china white.

728
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:21,658
Chien na wei. Yes, mr. Hui
is on her payroll.

729
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,026
He's chinese triad,

730
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:25,995
And he knows her agenda
here in hong kong.

731
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:27,330
Fortunately for you,
mr. Hui has been

732
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:29,999
Less than forthcoming
with the details.

733
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:32,168
Fortunately?

734
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:36,272
You get a stab
at redemption.

735
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,661
Barry: You could have invited
everybody, they'd like this.

736
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:00,663
Oliver: Well, no, they would
love this,

737
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:02,432
But this is just
for the two of us.

738
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:05,068
You mean, the one of you.
This was your idea.

739
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,003
You can't expect me
to believe

740
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:09,606
That you don't want to know,
once and for all,

741
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:11,241
Who would win--

742
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:12,275
Me or you.

743
00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:14,077
You mean if you don't
shoot me in the back.

744
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,445
You got to get
over that, barry.

745
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:17,213
Ok, I have super powers.

746
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:19,048
You have arrows that run out.

747
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,384
I have strategy
and tactical awareness.

748
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:24,087
When I'm fighting you, it's literally 
like you're standing still.

749
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:27,690
[chuckles] that's tough talk,
you ready to back it up?

750
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:28,591
Oh, yeah.

751
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,794
Hey, by the way...

752
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:32,228
Yeah?

753
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,197
You were wrong.

754
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:36,032
When you told me
I could inspire people,

755
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:37,100
You said you couldn't.

756
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:40,136
But you were wrong--
you can inspire.

757
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:43,940
Not as the arrow,
that guy's a douche.

758
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,575
[laughs]

759
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:48,011
But as oliver queen.

760
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,413
Thank you.

761
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:52,115
Since we're sharing,

762
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:54,584
You were wrong, too.

763
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:56,119
When?
Right now.

764
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:59,722
Because you think
you can kick my ass.

765
00:40:59,724 --> 00:40:59,722
I can tell.

766
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:02,492
All right, well, if you think
you can kick mine,

767
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:03,660
You better do it fast.

768
00:41:03,662 --> 00:41:07,230
I get it, barry,
I get it. You're fast.

769
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,339
Ready...

770
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:18,808
Set...
