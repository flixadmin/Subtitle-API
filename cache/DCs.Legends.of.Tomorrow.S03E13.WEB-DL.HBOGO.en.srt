1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:05,280
Pairs to being two regular women
on a completely normal first date.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,520
Wally West, I am trying to save
the universe, care to join me?

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,400
<i>When Nora was possessed by Mallus,
he seemed scared of my totem.</i>

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,360
You're one of the six.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,240
The hunt for the six totems
has begun.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,680
Good evening, Miss Jiwe.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
No.

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,120
Darling.

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,520
Wait.

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,000
He may be of value.

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,840
You know what getting I think
I have some more

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,160
where amazing french toast.

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,440
You must have worked up
an appetite last night.

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,280
Sara, can we take the Waverider
to when Mount St. Helens erupted?

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,360
I've always wanted...

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,440
Psych, that would not be
a cool thing to do.

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,880
This is, a very important
time vehicle.

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,760
We... we would never use it
for recreational

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,000
or dangerous purposes.

21
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,800
Hey, Ava.

22
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,200
You look great
in what you were wearing yesterday.

23
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,520
- Right.
- I'm going to...

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,240
I'm going to stop talking now, yeah.

25
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,400
Hey, Zari.

26
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,320
This is weird.

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,800
Why are there so many dirty dishes?

28
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,360
Ray loves doing dirty dishes.

29
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,440
Oh, yeah.

30
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,480
I also don't hear him spewing
the neurological benefits

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,760
of putting butter in his coffee.

32
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,120
Gideon, where's Ray?

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,680
<i>I don't know.</i>

34
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,880
<i>But we are being hailed
by the Time Bureau.</i>

35
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,280
Put them on.

36
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,960
<i>Hello, Legends and Agent Sharpe.</i>

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,040
What is it, Gary?

38
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,640
<i>This was just delivered to us.</i>

39
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,160
<i>There was a, a Palmer Tech
phone hidden inside</i>

40
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,480
<i>with a message recorded on it.</i>

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,440
<i>Hey, guys, if you're finding this,
it's me, Ray, obviously.</i>

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,800
<i>You've probably guessed by now,</i>

43
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,760
<i>that I have been abducted
by the Darhks.</i>

44
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,280
Hey, when we see him, do we tell him
we didn't even notice he was gone?

45
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,640
Yeah, definitely not.

46
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,760
<i>The Darhks said
that they'd let go of me</i>

47
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,840
<i>when they were done with me.</i>

48
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,120
<i>He is asking me if I want to see
a Grateful Dead concert,</i>

49
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,360
<i>which is really kind of weird.</i>

50
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,840
<i>But look, you'll probably
try to come after me and find me.</i>

51
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,800
<i>If you do,
he said that he'll kill me,</i>

52
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,320
<i>so, you know,
please don't do that.</i>

53
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,400
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

54
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,320
Okay, I have done as you asked,
so no more torture today, right?

55
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,280
I really don't think you understand
how this whole torture thing works.

56
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,480
Work.

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,680
Work, work, come on.

58
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,000
Why won't this stupid thing work?

59
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,400
{\an5}That stupid thing has been
in my family for generations.

60
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,080
It should've been mine.

61
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,800
Well, it's mine now.

62
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,160
{\an5}Besides, Mallus wishes
for only his most devoted followers

63
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,800
{\an5}to wield totems
and you already have one.

64
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,480
Now, why can't I access its powers?

65
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,520
{\an5}Because power is all it is to you.

66
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,520
{\an5}Until you find a selfless reason
to wield it,

67
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,240
{\an5}my grandmother's bond to the totem,
even at a distance,

68
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,840
will remain stronger than yours.

69
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,520
What about this Fire Totem
I stole in Detroit?

70
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,760
- Afraid of a broken trinket?
- That thing killed me once.

71
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,520
{\an5}Even in pieces,
it's still to be feared.

72
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,960
Totems are eternal.

73
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,760
They can never be destroyed.

74
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,120
So they can be fixed?

75
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,480
{\an5}Oh, so I can get a necklace myself?

76
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,120
It would take a truly brilliant mind
to figure out how.

77
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
You guys hungry?

78
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,960
I could really go for some eggs,
poached, runny.

79
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,840
Oh, my coffee with grass-fed butter
and MCT oil.

80
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,760
{\an5}Are you sure
we should be looking for Ray

81
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,960
after he told us not to?

82
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,680
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Ditto.

83
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,720
{\an5}I thought you said
they'd be psyched to see us.

84
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,560
{\an5}Look, I know
what you're both thinking,

85
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,720
{\an5}but if you'd just let me explain.

86
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,720
{\an5}If you're here to apologize
for burgling the Bureau

87
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,640
and... and, and humiliating Gary...

88
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,360
{\an5}Well, we actually did that
for a good reason,

89
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,800
{\an5}- because we have to stop "Mollusk".
- Yeah.

90
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,120
- Mallus.
- Mallus.

91
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,240
{\an5}And, yes, we know all about him.
Sara basically met him.

92
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,240
{\an5}And you're here,
because the Time Bureau

93
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,360
{\an5}has finally come to its senses, or...

94
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,880
- Ava and I are...
- Working together, independently.

95
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,840
Right, Wally, it's good to see you.

96
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,040
I remember you from Barry
and Iris's wedding.

97
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,360
Yeah, wasn't that so fun?

98
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,000
It was such a beautiful ceremony.

99
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,640
{\an5}The hors d'oeuvres were, like, meh.

100
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,080
{\an5}- And then, the Nazi invasion.
- The what?

101
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,120
All right, you guys still haven't
told us why you're on the ship.

102
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
Atoning...

103
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
{\an5}I hope.

104
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,680
{\an5}I should never have kept
you both in the dark.

105
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,600
{\an5}The deaths of those agents
and the return of Damien Darhk

106
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,680
will haunt me
for the rest of my days.

107
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,600
{\an5}But surely, you understand
the gravity now of what we're facing.

108
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,320
- Hey.
- Nate, my brother.

109
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,480
What are you doing here?

110
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,960
{\an5}- Hey, man.
- Oh, man.

111
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,480
What the hell are you doing here?

112
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,720
Any sign of Ray?

113
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,680
{\an5}Oh, no, just another
Grateful Dead end.

114
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,400
- I for sure got a contact-high.
- Yeah.

115
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,160
{\an5}And I managed to swipe
Jerry Garcia's glasses.

116
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,120
Once a thief, always a thief.

117
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,240
{\an5}No, we... we allow light
to moderate theft on this ship.

118
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,720
We like to call them souvenirs.

119
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,320
It's okay, it's okay.

120
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
No, no, no.

121
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,280
No, not gonna do it.

122
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,000
{\an5}You and I both realize
that your idiot friends

123
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,920
{\an5}are gonna search
every Dead show in history

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,560
{\an5}before they realize
that I don't even like jam bands.

125
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,000
{\an5}Be that as it may,
I will not fix the Fire Totem.

126
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,440
Sorry.

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,040
You're gonna have to kill me.

128
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,200
- Suit yourself.
- No, no, no.

129
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,280
Hold on a second, sweetie.

130
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,840
{\an5}I think I'm gonna give
this suit to Genghis Khan.

131
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,000
Imagine what history would be like
if the Mongols

132
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,120
had a dwarf star-powered
rocket man.

133
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,560
{\an5}The Legends will just find
the anachronism and fix it.

134
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,560
Good point, way to go, Ray.

135
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,880
{\an5}Maybe I will just murder
a young Sandy Palmer

136
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,160
{\an5}picking her sons up
from Ivy Springs Day Care, 1982.

137
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,600
I'll need a lab.

138
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,960
{\an5}UPSWIPZ HQ 2018

139
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
Hi, Alan.

140
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,520
- Sorry, Alan.
- What the hell, Ray? You quit.

141
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,400
There's no take-backs in Upswipz.

142
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,800
Oh, you're the up-and-down guy.

143
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,800
Me, I prefer side to side.

144
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,120
Our focus groups found
up and down was more intuitive.

145
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,880
Okay, wait, wait.

146
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,360
You know, he might be right.

147
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,120
We think it shifts the paradigm.

148
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,440
Oh, you have your lab.

149
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,520
Now, get to work, nerd.

150
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,040
We are still not any closer
to finding Ray.

151
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,200
Nate, I need you hitting those books.

152
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,560
Look for any sign of him.

153
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,240
Gideon, scan the anachronism map.

154
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,000
Something pops up, you let us know.

155
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,640
- Rory...
- Crush a six-pack.

156
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
You do what you do.

157
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,840
I'll head back to the Bureau,
put our resources on it, too.

158
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,280
I have an idea.

159
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,240
- It's a little experimental.
- I'm listening.

160
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,720
Well, we know that Ray
is with the Darhks

161
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,840
and so is my totem.

162
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,600
If I meditate with Zari
using her totem to anchor me,

163
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,720
I think I can reach out
to the Ancestral Plane.

164
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,760
- If we find my totem, then...
- Then you find Ray.

165
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
Meditation?

166
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,600
I've actually been doing
a lot of that

167
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,840
and I think I could help you.

168
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,560
Perfect, make it happen.

169
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,960
Sweetie, you think it's too early
for me to, you know,

170
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,840
get back out there?

171
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,240
I mean, how long should
I mourn your mother?

172
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,920
It's been 23 years on my end, Dad.

173
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,520
I say go for it.

174
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,680
Thank you.

175
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,240
Trouble is, I haven't had
a single match yet.

176
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,440
I think the thing is broken.

177
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
If I may...

178
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,560
You might have more luck
if you talk about your hobbies.

179
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,960
I just said that I enjoy
destroying the world

180
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,640
to remake it in my image.

181
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,720
Oh, I like trying new restaurants.

182
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,360
Also, your profile says
you're 199 years old.

183
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,880
Yeah, it, it wouldn't go any higher.

184
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,960
Can you fix that?

185
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,720
Well, everyone lies
about their age, brah.

186
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,920
- Can you please stop fooling around?
- Nora-doll.

187
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,200
What's the point of living
if you can't have a bit of fun?

188
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,760
Well, I'm not enjoying myself.

189
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,800
- I'm annoyed.
- Hi, Annoyed.

190
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,880
I'm Dad.

191
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,520
Right? That's good.

192
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,760
Fine.

193
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,840
No.

194
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,080
Okay, I have analyzed the shards.

195
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,640
We'd have to go back
to the Big Bang

196
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,040
in order to get enough energy
to reignite the Fire Totem.

197
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,960
That or invent cold fusion.

198
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,840
- And since that's not possible...
- Yes, it is.

199
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,400
Cold fusion was invented in 1962

200
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,960
by a German physicist
named Bernhard Vogal.

201
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,600
Yeah, no.

202
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,840
- See, I'm kind of a science dork.
- Kind of?

203
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,720
And if someone had invented
cold fusion, let alone in 1962,

204
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,920
I think I'd have heard of it.

205
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,280
Actually there's a very good reason
why you haven't.

206
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,560
The reason you've never heard
of Bernhard Vogal

207
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,360
is because the most ruthless
and efficient assassin

208
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,120
the world has ever known
made sure that no one ever did.

209
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Me.

210
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,200
Killing Vogal
was one of my greatest hits.

211
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,040
Someone developed an energy source
that could have replaced fossil fuels

212
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,560
and essentially save the world?

213
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,000
While putting the oil industry
out of business.

214
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,880
Some very powerful people
with some very deep pockets

215
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,040
wouldn't stand for it,
so they hired me.

216
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,320
He was waiting for transfer,

217
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,280
holed up in an East Berlin
safe house,

218
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,720
somewhat of a misnomer in this case
when your old man got involved.

219
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,560
And you buried the secret
to cold fusion?

220
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,120
And the man who created it.

221
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,680
Yeah, I know, that was implied.

222
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,160
Well I guess I'm off to East Berlin
to stop myself from killing Vogal.

223
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,240
Should be fun.

224
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,320
You watch the prisoner

225
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,480
and I'll bring you back
some chocolate.

226
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
Oh, who am I kidding?

227
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,480
I'm probably gonna get a hat
for myself, too.

228
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,360
No, I'm going.

229
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,480
To 1962 Berlin?

230
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,600
Too dangerous.

231
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,240
If your younger self sees you,

232
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,520
it could change the course
of your entire life.

233
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,680
All right, obviously,
you haven't been listening.

234
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,800
We're talking about going back
against me in my prime.

235
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,680
You don't stand a chance, Nora-doll.

236
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,560
We're partners,
I can do this mission.

237
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,640
Or you could just
call the whole thing off.

238
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,160
This is obviously causing
a lot of family tension.

239
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,600
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

240
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,120
All right, tell me your plan.

241
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,960
We return to 1962
and convince Dr. Vogal

242
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
that we're American agents
there to help him.

243
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,760
Then we jump straight back
to this moment.

244
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,960
Oh, I'm sorry.

245
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,480
We? Are you taking him?

246
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,800
Dr. Vogal needs to trust us fast,
which means he needs a peer.

247
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,560
Someone who speaks nerd.

248
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,240
You better come right back,
you two, do you understand me?

249
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,080
And use protection.

250
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,240
- I think he's warming to me.
- Just go, God.

251
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,320
{\an5}EAST BERLIN 1962

252
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,240
Just follow my lead
and we'll be out of here

253
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,000
before my dad even shows up.

254
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,600
My God, what's he doing...

255
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
Be quiet and listen.

256
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,800
Your life depends on it.

257
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,880
Are you decent?

258
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,880
We're the CIA,
here to take you back to America.

259
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,480
No, West Berlin.

260
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,760
As I told your British friends,

261
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,200
I, I will not speak a word
about cold fusion

262
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,800
until I am reunited with my family.

263
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,640
Touching, but not our mission.

264
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,920
We'll get you back to your family,

265
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,040
but first, you have to come
with us, it's not safe here.

266
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,120
Wait, I, I have to get something
from the other room.

267
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,400
- A doll for my daughter.
- No, no, no.

268
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,520
No, there's no time.

269
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,040
There's an assassin
on his way here right now

270
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,160
and trust me, he's not very nice.

271
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,440
I will not leave here
without that doll.

272
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,960
Can I hurt him yet?

273
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,120
Hurt me?

274
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,000
Wait, you are not CIA.

275
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,440
Help, intru...

276
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Release him.

277
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,160
Stand back.

278
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,080
Oh, crap.

279
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,480
What happened to your magic fingers?

280
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,240
That virus you shot me with
must be affecting my powers.

281
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,920
We got to get out of here
before more guards come,

282
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,080
or worse, your dad.

283
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
Dr. Vogal.

284
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,760
Hey, we're here to save you.

285
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,480
Hey, who are you?

286
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
Hey.

287
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
Hello.

288
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,480
No.

289
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,320
See?

290
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,520
Who needs magic?

291
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,040
- Hold
- Stand down.

292
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,920
Run.

293
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,240
Okay, I believe you.

294
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,600
Get me out of here.

295
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,920
Time-jump us out of here.

296
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,520
Oh, crap, there goes our exit.

297
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,560
Well, back to basics.

298
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,120
So I just eat this Lyoga root
and it's, boom, vision quest?

299
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
No.

300
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,320
That much would kill you.

301
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,840
This tea has plenty to take you
to the world between worlds.

302
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,080
We'll use your totem to anchor us
while we look for any signs of mine

303
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,960
and, hopefully, Ray along with it.

304
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,680
The incense will calm you

305
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,040
and I'm just gonna ease you
into the altered state

306
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,520
through some guided meditation.

307
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,320
- Thank you for helping us.
- Yeah.

308
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
So, how do you know Nathaniel?

309
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,200
I was kind of like his
wingman back in Central City.

310
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,120
Just helped him
get over a broken heart, actually,

311
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,040
because this basic bitch
just dumped him on his birthday.

312
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,760
Can you believe that?

313
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,040
Yeah, because I was actually
that basic bitch.

314
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,560
Great vibe, Wally.

315
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,800
- I think we can take it from here.
- Yeah, yeah, okay, I'm gonna go.

316
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,240
Okay.

317
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
No worries.

318
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,200
That's a classic
first-attempt blunder.

319
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,880
Happens to the Legends all the time,
sometimes twice on the same mission.

320
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,800
All we need to do is regroup
and come up with plan B.

321
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,800
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Plan B.

322
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,680
Tell us the formula for cold fusion,
or I'll break your fingers.

323
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,760
No.

324
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,240
The formula can die with me.

325
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,560
Oh, I'm not gonna kill you.

326
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,360
- You'll just wish I had.
- Nora, just put it down.

327
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,600
- Torture is not the answer.
- Yeah, but it's fun either way.

328
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,680
Do your worst.

329
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,400
I've already faced
the most terrible pain

330
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,520
that a man can endure.

331
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,680
The prospect that

332
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,760
he will never again see
the ones he holds most dear.

333
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,200
The doll, it's your daughters?

334
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,200
I only had enough money
for papers for my wife and daughter.

335
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,160
So when they left,
Greta wanted me to keep it...

336
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,880
with the promise that I would
bring it back to her soon.

337
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,080
So...

338
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,440
Torture me all you want, Fraulein.

339
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,600
I swear, I will never give up
my secret until I am with my family.

340
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,560
This was supposed to be simple,
in and out.

341
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,520
Now, we're stuck here in this dump.

342
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,120
Damn it.

343
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,560
My father still thinks
I'm a little kid.

344
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,200
Now, he's gonna lord it over me
that he's stronger than me,

345
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,080
that we're not equals and that if...

346
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,360
that I failed.

347
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,560
It's not all bad.

348
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,920
We have extended Dr. Vogal's life
past its normal expiration date.

349
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,880
- What?
- So, all we have to do is

350
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,920
just get him across the border
and then he'll talk, right?

351
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,720
Of course.

352
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,960
Why didn't I think of that?

353
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,080
We'll just mosey across

354
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,640
the most heavily guarded
border in all of history.

355
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,760
Yeah.

356
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,120
- Is that sarcasm?
- No.

357
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,800
No, that's not sarcasm.

358
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,040
Yes, it's sarcasm.

359
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,920
Look, it's not gonna work.

360
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,440
- Without magic, it's impossible.
- Nothing's impossible.

361
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,440
We thought cold fusion
was impossible.

362
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,000
So you don't have magic.

363
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,240
Young Darhk is no match
for our brains and determination.

364
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,560
And you know what?

365
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,840
It's high time you showed your dad
what's really inside you.

366
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
Besides a demon.

367
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,840
Dr. Vogal, where does one go
to acquire forged papers?

368
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,280
Looks like our master forger's
changed occupations.

369
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,120
This was the address I was given.

370
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,000
Perhaps we should come back
during the day.

371
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,040
You really think we'll live
to see morning

372
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,400
with you-know-who on our tail?

373
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,480
Wait.

374
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,920
Don't judge a storefront by its hats.

375
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,920
Let's get to work.

376
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,600
First, the documents
must be flawless.

377
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,320
Then, we need the right
set of wheels.

378
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,280
Only diplomatic vehicles are the ones
to be waved across the checkpoint.

379
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,080
<i>Guten abend.</i>

380
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,520
<i>Guten abend.</i>

381
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,240
You look like a yummy
morsel, Fraulein.

382
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,280
How much for a little taste?

383
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,000
How about your car?

384
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,440
And last but not least,

385
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,920
the most important
part of any time-travel mission,

386
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,360
disguises.

387
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,160
Legends never go
anywhere without them.

388
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,720
Thank you so much, and again,
sorry for ruining your night.

389
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,040
They should've been back
an hour ago.

390
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,680
Was I not clear when I said,
"Come right back, no dawdling?"

391
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,640
I think I was crystal clear
on that point.

392
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,520
You know, maybe you're right.

393
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,760
Maybe she is testing me,

394
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,880
pushing her curfew
to see how I react.

395
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,480
Am I being paranoid?

396
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Maybe you're right.

397
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,720
Maybe I'm not being paranoid enough.

398
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,920
Maybe she needs me
to be more involved.

399
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,640
I mean, for her,
I've been gone for 20 years.

400
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,640
Oh, think of everything
that I've missed.

401
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,600
Life was so much simpler
before fatherhood.

402
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,120
So much anxiety.

403
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,840
You know, you're right, Alan.

404
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,240
I need to take action,
not wallow in doubt.

405
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,840
I'm going after them.

406
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,000
Thanks, pal.

407
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
Great chat.

408
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,720
Don't worry, Nora.

409
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,400
Daddy's coming.

410
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,120
Remember our story.

411
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,360
Yeah.

412
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,880
Now is probably
not the right time to mention

413
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,600
that I'm a...
that I'm a terrible liar.

414
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,760
Try and imagine my surprise.

415
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,440
Papers?

416
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,000
What were you doing in East Berlin?

417
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,880
We... we were at the opera.

418
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,960
For the whole night?

419
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,400
Opera was a... a very long show.

420
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,760
Big show, good show.

421
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,400
We have the best shows.

422
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,560
Very long, very big, but very good...

423
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,120
Is there some problem?

424
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,480
I just find it odd you're returning
at this hour of the morning.

425
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,840
We made a proper night of it.

426
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,560
I must run this by my supervisor.

427
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
(Foreign Language)

428
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,200
You stay back, stay back.

429
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,840
Do you know who my husband is?

430
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,280
You know what?

431
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,880
Do bring your supervisor over.

432
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,680
I want him to know just how idiotic
his underlings are.

433
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,440
- Excuse me, sir.
- Of course, I... I see it now.

434
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,640
I'm sorry, mein Herr.

435
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,480
I, I did not recognize you in that...

436
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,840
hat.

437
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,680
You, on the other hand,
are a fantastic liar.

438
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,560
Oh, no. It's my dad.

439
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,880
Yeah, hit man Darhk's gonna kill us.

440
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
Not that dad. That dad.

441
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,280
Oh, he's definitely gonna kill me.

442
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,760
I was supposed
to have you home by now.

443
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,640
What the hell are you doing here?

444
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,840
Saving you, Nora-doll.

445
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,000
And is that any way
to speak to your father?

446
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,600
Safety first. Strap in, kids.

447
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Floor it.

448
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,120
I could've handled myself back there.

449
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,400
I didn't need your help.

450
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,560
For the love of Mallus,

451
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,480
would you stop
with the hat thing already?

452
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,240
Oh, hi.

453
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,040
Is all of this just a game to you?

454
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,920
Because I feel like I'm the only one
taking any of this seriously.

455
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,800
Well, since my Time Stone
still works,

456
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,760
we're gonna do things my way.

457
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,880
We're gonna bring
the good doctor back to 2018

458
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,720
and torture him until he talks.

459
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,960
Torture isn't the answer.

460
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,160
Says who?

461
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,080
He knows his secret is the only way
he'll ever see his daughter again,

462
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,160
because unlike some fathers,

463
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,080
he values his family
more than himself.

464
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,840
I just saved your life back there.

465
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,920
What...

466
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,560
Honey bunny, listen...

467
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,920
Look at me, don't you know

468
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,880
that I've only ever had
your best interests at heart?

469
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,800
Was it in my best interest or yours

470
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,320
when you pushed a scared little girl
into the arms of a demon?

471
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,240
- Yeah, to bring us back together.
- To bring you back to life.

472
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,600
What has gotten into you?

473
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,720
I send you off on one lousy mission
by yourself, and suddenly the...

474
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,120
Oh, of course.

475
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,080
I should have known Ray Palmer
would be a good influence on you.

476
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,520
Perhaps I should give you
two some privacy.

477
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,560
You know what?

478
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,760
I thought I raised my father
from the dead,

479
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,480
but instead I see
I just got a selfish man-child.

480
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,840
"Man-child"?

481
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,760
Why don't you run along
to your little hellscape

482
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,560
and boo-hoo to Mallus?

483
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,280
Because now, that you're
a demon's mouthpiece,

484
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,360
it's obvious you don't need me.

485
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,520
Nora, I...

486
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,280
- Nora.
- Leave me alone, Dad.

487
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,840
No, that's good.
Just... just keep talking.

488
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,720
So, Ray's nowhere to be found

489
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,400
and things are getting worse
at the Bureau.

490
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,520
Bennett is so stubborn,
he's refusing any meetings

491
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,400
with Rip that don't involve shackles.

492
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,600
I'm so sorry. Here I am babbling

493
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,560
about Bureau politics,
and your friend is in trouble.

494
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,800
How are you holding up?

495
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,600
Mutilating photos of your nemesis.
Got it.

496
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,000
Well, at least our nonverbal
communication skills

497
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,080
are off to a good start.

498
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,840
Everything that we're doing
to find Ray,

499
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,120
it's turning up empty.

500
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,000
Hey, you're gonna get Ray back,
I promise.

501
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,120
Can we have a little bit more
of some nonverbal communication?

502
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,960
I... I, I thought you said
this place was beautiful.

503
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,920
Yeah, it was.

504
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,520
Something's wrong.

505
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,720
You shouldn't be
walking around alone.

506
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,640
Stop treating...

507
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,880
You.

508
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,160
Expecting someone else?

509
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,800
You know, the last time I saw Nora,
she was still Daddy's little girl.

510
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,600
And before you know it...

511
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,920
20 years passes just like that.

512
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,320
And, sure, we're traveling
through time together,

513
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,320
plotting the end of the world, but...

514
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,040
I'm left wondering,
where is that little girl

515
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,920
and how do I get her back?

516
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,920
Look, I'm not keeping you alive
for my health.

517
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Speak.

518
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,560
See...

519
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,400
If you really care that much
about Nora,

520
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,520
then maybe you shouldn't let her be
a conduit for a primordial evil.

521
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,200
I admit, this isn't the life
that I wanted for her, but...

522
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,240
world domination was supposed
to be my gift to her,

523
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,680
not her career path.

524
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,720
Then maybe
you should tell her how you feel.

525
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,960
She's under a lot of pressure,
you know.

526
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,160
- And it's all to impress you.
- Me?

527
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,160
I am so proud of Nora.

528
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,720
Obviously she knows that.

529
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,200
She only knows
what you say to her, Damien.

530
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,440
Can I call you Damien?

531
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,680
- Yeah?
- I have the girl.

532
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
<i>Nora?</i>

533
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,160
<i>If you hurt her, I swear...</i>

534
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,920
Meet me on the rooftop
of the Schneider Cement building.

535
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,040
An even exchange.

536
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,560
Her life for the scientist.

537
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,360
I am gonna kick my ass.

538
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,880
What is it? Is it Nora?

539
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,400
- Is she okay?
- She's alive.

540
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,320
His life for hers.
He wants to meet in one hour.

541
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,600
I should've just listened.
This is all my fault.

542
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,640
- If I lose her...
- Look, it seems like

543
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,280
- you're having trouble with a knot.
- I am.

544
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,680
Okay, well, you're probably slipping
the slack through the half-hitch.

545
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,560
- How do you know that?
- Because I'm an Eagle Scout.

546
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,240
Trust me.
Look, I, I fought you lots of times.

547
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,680
Together, we can save Nora.

548
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,200
Just give me back my suit.

549
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,360
Oh, sure,
and after we save my daughter,

550
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,680
maybe we can go shoot some hoops
and grab a brewski.

551
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,200
Now, that's a good knot.

552
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,040
One therapy session
does not make us friends.

553
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,480
You are still gonna die
when I'm done with you.

554
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,560
You...

555
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,000
There's no reason
why we can't collaborate.

556
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,120
We'll take the doctor for a few days
and give him back

557
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,320
when we're done with him.

558
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,880
You don't want to talk
about your plan even a little bit?

559
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,280
Oh, the plan is simple.

560
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,960
I'm going to kill you.

561
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,840
Hey, you know, I think we should go.

562
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,520
No, not yet.

563
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,040
It's like I can feel
my totem everywhere in here,

564
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,040
but it feels different.

565
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,120
You're still here.

566
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,080
What happened to this place?

567
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,960
The longer your totem
is in the possession of darkness,

568
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,080
the more it is corrupted.

569
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,240
I am fighting it,
but I cannot resist forever.

570
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,560
I'll get my totem back, I promise.

571
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,160
You must get Kuasa back as well.

572
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,640
She needs you.

573
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,120
And soon you will need her.

574
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,200
What for?

575
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,520
The first totem bearers
imprisoned a great evil

576
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,280
- and if he breaks free...
- You mean Mallus?

577
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,600
Do not say his name here.

578
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,160
He cannot enter your world,

579
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,560
but this is the world between worlds.

580
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,680
Time does not exist here
and time is his cage.

581
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,040
And the further time is broken,

582
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,320
the closer the demon
comes to break him free.

583
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,360
This is why Darhk and his allies
are creating anachronisms.

584
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,320
And if you do not stop them,

585
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,320
all of time is at risk.

586
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,440
Nora.

587
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,040
- If you hurt her, I...
- I want to see the scientist.

588
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,400
Now, give me back my daughter,
you cocky little bastard.

589
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,400
Nora!

590
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,880
No!

591
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,200
I got you. I won't let you fall.

592
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,040
This is why I'll never have kids.

593
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,760
They make you weak.

594
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,720
Dad!

595
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,640
Magic.

596
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,440
I should look into that.

597
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,520
I got you.

598
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,480
Activate suit.

599
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,640
Activate suit.

600
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,760
<i>Voice authentication denied.</i>

601
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,320
Okay. Suit, fire Atom Blaster.

602
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,800
<i>Dr. Palmer, voice authenticated.</i>

603
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,480
Okay, reduce Atom Blaster
power by 99 percent.

604
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,240
Target...

605
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,000
45 degrees to the left,
10 degrees down.

606
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,920
Make it 10.1 degrees.

607
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,800
And...

608
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,920
Fire?

609
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,840
Nora.

610
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,800
Dad...

611
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,840
You have to let me go.

612
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,640
No. I won't.

613
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,320
If you don't, you'll die.

614
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,360
No.

615
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,680
I can't lose you, not again.

616
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,760
I'll be okay.

617
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,680
I love you.

618
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,000
Why won't you die?

619
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,800
Because I have something
to live for.

620
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,560
The totem, it's turned.

621
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,880
She has claimed its power.

622
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,280
Okay, we need to get out of here.

623
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,480
No. You must leave, my children.

624
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,800
Run.

625
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,560
Looks like you still got it, old man.

626
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,800
Who you calling old man?
I look good for 257.

627
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,360
I've always wanted to do that.

628
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,520
Nice one, honey.

629
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,960
Got them.

630
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,320
Dr. Vogal, you okay?

631
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,600
A Roboter man?

632
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,880
No, no, it's me.

633
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,960
Look, we got to get you out of here.

634
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,440
I can't make it.
It's too late for me.

635
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,280
Here, take this.

636
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,000
No. No, you're gonna get it back
to Greta yourself.

637
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,000
The doll was never hers.

638
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,560
Everything you need to know
about cold fusion...

639
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,280
it's all in there.

640
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,160
I'm not gonna leave you here.

641
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,240
Your family needs you

642
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,000
and the planet
needs your brilliant mind.

643
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,120
Okay.

644
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,440
No.

645
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,840
Well, I wasn't gonna let him
ruin my perfect record.

646
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,000
Excuse me.

647
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,280
Where do you think you're going
with that doll, Ray?

648
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,200
I promised Vogal
I'd get this back to his daughter.

649
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,080
If I've learned one thing
from all of this,

650
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,680
it's that you're a terrible liar.

651
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,680
Give me the doll.

652
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,480
Sorry, Nora.

653
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,080
I can't do that.

654
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,560
Come on, you and I both know
you're not gonna shoot me.

655
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,320
You're right.

656
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,320
What was that?

657
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,880
It's a time quake.
Gideon, what's the source?

658
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,440
<i>An Aberration has occurred in 1962.</i>

659
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,840
<i>It appears that someone has blasted
a hole in the Berlin Wall.</i>

660
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,680
- Ray.
- Which appears to be the straw

661
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,240
that broke the camel's back.

662
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I'm guessing that's bad.

663
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,800
Yeah, those are tears
in the fabric of time itself.

664
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,320
Gideon, plot a course
for East Berlin, 1962.

665
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,040
All right, kid, you're up.

666
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,600
Let's see how fast you really are.

667
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,000
Okay, you're gonna want to hold on.

668
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,320
Oh, see you.

669
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,200
Speedsters?

670
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,160
I hate speedsters.

671
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,200
Almost as much as I hate that guy.

672
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,440
- Look who I bumped into.
- Hey.

673
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,560
- Buddy.
- Hey.

674
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,120
Ray, thank God you're back.

675
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,280
Yeah, dishes need cleaning.

676
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,080
And I can't wait to get them done.

677
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,000
Rip, nice to see...

678
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,560
Wait, is it nice to see Rip?

679
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,040
Yeah. Yeah.

680
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,560
- Oh, okay.
- I hope that your abduction

681
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,040
afforded you some insights
into our opponent's designs.

682
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,560
Yes, they needed me to reignite
the Fire Totem, using this.

683
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,640
Another doll.

684
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,800
How wonderful.

685
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,120
Well, no, actually it's...

686
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,360
- Oh, she...
- The secret to cold fusion,

687
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,840
which is pretty epic.

688
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,160
Now, all we're missing
is the Fire Totem.

689
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,120
Oh, you mean this?

690
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,320
Yeah.

691
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,600
How do you get this?

692
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,880
Well, I saw it
in Damien Darhk's pocket

693
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,560
and I thought, "Yo, that
would make a sick souvenir."

694
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,440
- What?
- Well, great.

695
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,200
I can get to work putting
this back together right now.

696
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,200
Then it'll be three against two.

697
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,600
And with yours,
it'll be four to one.

698
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,680
Good to see you.

699
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,600
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, welcome back.

700
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,000
We found out that my totem
has been corrupted

701
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,640
when we were on our vision quest.

702
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,000
But we did find out
why the Darhks are so psyched

703
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,640
about anachronisms.

704
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,480
The more the timeline's corrupted,

705
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,920
the weaker the prison
holding Mallus becomes.

706
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,240
If they continue destroying history,
the demon will be freed.

707
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,800
You should inform the Time Bureau.

708
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,600
Immediately.

709
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,880
Gideon, patch us
through to Director Bennett, please.

710
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,560
<i>Make it fast, Agent Sharpe,
because I've got to stop</i>

711
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,520
<i>Alexander Hamilton
from seeing Hamilton the musical.</i>

712
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,840
How's it possible that everyone
got tickets to that but me?

713
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,400
Director Bennett,
we have some developments

714
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,680
in the Mallus investigation
that you need to be aware of.

715
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,040
<i>Such as your arresting
Director Hunter?</i>

716
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,720
I, haven't arrested him

717
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,240
- exactly yet.
- Look, we got bigger problems

718
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,560
right now, than punishing Rip
for what happened to those agents.

719
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,120
<i>I doubt those deceased agents
would agree with you, Miss Lance.</i>

720
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,120
<i>Now, you place Hunter
in handcuffs this instant,</i>

721
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,480
<i>or you're all going to...</i>

722
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,280
- Oh, my God.
- It's Grodd, actually.

723
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,960
Ava, I'm so sorry.
He was a good man, I think.

724
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,200
Yes, most unfortunate.

725
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,520
I believe that this tragedy makes you

726
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,720
the highest-ranking official
at the Bureau.

727
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,240
May I return to work...

728
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,600
Director Sharpe?

729
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Yes.

730
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,760
Thank you for searching
all of history

731
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,640
to save me from
a demented supervillain.

732
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,640
Two demented supervillains.

733
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,960
Are you forgetting the apple
of Damien Darhk's eye?

734
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,720
She's had a tough life.

735
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,880
She may come off all mean
and witchy but,

736
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,720
underneath all that,
she's a real person.

737
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,960
Wait.

738
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,920
Do you have the hots for Nora Darhk?

739
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,200
What? No.

740
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,160
No. No?

741
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,200
Look, I'm not blind. She's hot.

742
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,640
But she's also bonkers, which is...

743
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,120
kind of hot.

744
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,720
I just think that...

745
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,600
You know,
maybe there's hope for her.

746
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,640
You would, you big softie.

747
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,800
But you're a delicate flower,
Raymond Palmer.

748
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,560
Take care of that heart of yours.

749
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
Wally.

750
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,840
Hey.

751
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,800
I just wanted to say,
good job out there.

752
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,360
Are you sticking around?

753
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,320
No, I, I might join Rip
at the Time Bureau instead.

754
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,720
Right. Yeah, I mean, I get that.

755
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,000
If you want to go hang out
with a bunch of stiffs

756
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,560
instead of the cool kids, but, yeah.

757
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,600
Well, I'm kind of getting,
like, a weird vibe here.

758
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,520
Like, I feel like Mick and Zari
both hate me already

759
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,840
and the others are probably
not that far behind, so...

760
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,760
So, what?
I mean, when Nate first arrived,

761
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,160
he threw Ray into the Temporal Zone.

762
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,560
Amaya beat everybody up.

763
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,400
Zari tricked us
into pulling off a heist.

764
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,960
And Mick, well, he's betrayed us
at least 10 times.

765
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,080
I mean, we're kind of like

766
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,400
the all-stars
of bad first impressions, so...

767
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,560
I think you'd fit in great.

768
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,920
Wally, there you are.

769
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,320
Ready to leave?

770
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,440
I'm actually gonna stay.

771
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,560
I was hoping you would.

772
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,560
Well, I wish we could stay longer,

773
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,920
but my boss
was just murdered by a gorilla,

774
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,840
not to mention the mess
in Berlin that needs fixing.

775
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,200
Well, call me.

776
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,120
Until next time, Captain Lance.

777
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,560
Until next time, Agent Hunter.

778
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,280
Director Sharpe.

779
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,240
So...

780
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,920
you and Miss Lance.

781
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,040
I, I think
there's something real there.

782
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,080
Yep, she's, she's special.

783
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,880
And so are you.

784
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,120
Gideon, delete file 354-Z.

785
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,520
Sara can never find out
the truth about Ava.

786
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,360
<i>Yes, Director Hunter.</i>

787
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,240
I thought you were getting
a breath of fresh air.

788
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,560
Well, I felt like an apology
was in order.

789
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,720
I lost the Fire Totem

790
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,960
and I know how much
it meant to you

791
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,320
and to the big guy, Mallus.

792
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,800
But I also remember something

793
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,760
that used to bring a smile
to your face.

794
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,560
Hot chocolate

795
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,760
with whipped cream
and caramel sauce.

796
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,880
Oh, wow. I haven't had
one of these since...

797
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,320
Since I came and told you
to join the Order.

798
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,600
Since I sent you
into the arms of a demon.

799
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,320
I'm glad you did.

800
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,440
- It brought us back together.
- No.

801
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,200
I never should've doubted
your strength.

802
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,600
Look, I know you feel
a lot of pressure

803
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,920
to be like your old man,
but I just want you to know that...

804
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,800
I'm proud of you,

805
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,040
no matter what.

806
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,360
Oh, I think there's something
in my eye there.

807
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,280
I think I saw some Brandy back there
for our hot chocolate.

808
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,440
Let me go get some.

809
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,040
Everything okay, Nora-doll?

810
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,360
I'm fine, Daddy.
