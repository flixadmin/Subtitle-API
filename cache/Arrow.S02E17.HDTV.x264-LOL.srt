1
00:00:00,955 --> 00:00:03,563
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,663 --> 00:00:06,497
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:06,499 --> 00:00:09,083
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,085 --> 00:00:11,418
to save my city.

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,706
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:20,094
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:20,096 --> 00:00:24,131
I must be something else.

8
00:00:25,315 --> 00:00:26,984
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:28,719
This is my daughter, Helena.

10
00:00:28,721 --> 00:00:30,437
When her father
killed her fiancé,

11
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:32,556
she changed into something
dark and twisted.

12
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,608
My father doesn't deserve
a second chance--

13
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,410
a second life.

14
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:40,397
This is about
learning to control your strength.

15
00:00:42,734 --> 00:00:45,619
Ollie, it's over!
We got to get off this ship!

16
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,299
Hugo mannheim.

17
00:00:58,301 --> 00:01:00,584
Warrants out for racketeering,
extortion, murder--

18
00:01:00,586 --> 00:01:02,136
the goombah trifecta.

19
00:01:02,138 --> 00:01:04,471
But he never travels alone,
so watch your back,

20
00:01:04,473 --> 00:01:06,357
watch your partner's back.

21
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:08,058
Let's go.

22
00:01:13,982 --> 00:01:17,267
Thanks for helping me
keep watch over my dad tonight.

23
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:22,406
As long as Slade's out there,
neither of our families are safe.

24
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,211
This is the SCPD!
Put your weapons on the ground!

25
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:29,546
Move, move, move!

26
00:01:48,183 --> 00:01:49,767
Aaah!

27
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:06,650
Freeze!

28
00:02:16,544 --> 00:02:19,096
Go. Go!

29
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:40,951
Frank Bertinelli...

30
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,520
My daughter
sent you to kill me.

31

33
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:17,604
Hey.

34
00:03:17,606 --> 00:03:18,806
Dad, are you all
right? Are you hurt?

35
00:03:18,808 --> 00:03:20,574
Yeah, I'm fine,
sweetheart.

36
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:22,192
Listen, I know you don't
exactly believe

37
00:03:22,194 --> 00:03:23,811
in reading perps
their Mirandas,

38
00:03:23,813 --> 00:03:25,863
but you can't just toss a guy
out of a window.

39
00:03:25,865 --> 00:03:27,114
He shot you.

40
00:03:27,116 --> 00:03:28,615
And I'm still
here, ain't I?

41
00:03:28,617 --> 00:03:30,701
Just next time, show
a little restraint.

42
00:03:30,703 --> 00:03:32,536
That was me
showing restraint.

43
00:03:32,538 --> 00:03:35,339
Detective.
We have another problem.

44
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:37,124
Yeah, I know.
With Frank Bertinelli in custody,

45
00:03:37,126 --> 00:03:39,843
it's just a matter of time before
She-Ro is back in town.

46
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,912
Who is she?

47
00:03:41,914 --> 00:03:44,264
Helena Bertinelli.
Daughter of mafia boss Frank Bertinelli.

48
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,967
Or as I like to call
her, Oliver's psycho ex-girlfriend

49
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:48,635
hell-bent on revenge
against her father.

50
00:03:48,637 --> 00:03:50,554
Ex-girlfriend?

51
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:52,473
That's what you took
from that sentence?

52
00:03:52,475 --> 00:03:54,942
Wait, why does
she want her father killed so badly?

53
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:56,477
He had her fiancé
murdered.

54
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,812
She wants payback.
Puts the many fights

55
00:03:58,814 --> 00:04:00,030
I've had with
my father in perspective.

56
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,281
I've been
keeping tabs

57
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,699
on Helena over
the past year.

58
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,234
Last known sighting
was a month ago,

59
00:04:04,236 --> 00:04:06,203
Palermo.

60
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,489
She's been busy.
If by "busy,"

61
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:10,958
you mean torturing
and killing mafiosos

62
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,459
that might know
where her father is.

63
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,378
Bertinelli's arrest
just hit the wires.

64
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,664
How long do you think we have
before Helena books a ticket back home?

65
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:32,563
Go ahead.

66
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:33,897
Slade, please--

67
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,933
Aah!

68
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:38,602
Why aren't we moving yet?

69
00:04:38,604 --> 00:04:40,854
We managed to repair the hull.

70
00:04:40,856 --> 00:04:42,906
But the engine is too damaged.

71
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,776
So fix it.
I can't.

72
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:49,696
I don't know how!

73
00:04:49,698 --> 00:04:52,082
Then find
somebody who does.

74
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:56,537
Hi, my name's Laurel,
I'm an alcoholic.

75
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:58,005
Hi, Laurel.

76
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:02,292
And this is actually
my second meeting today.

77
00:05:02,294 --> 00:05:05,179
It's just, uh...

78
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:08,015
It's just so hard,
because I don't know

79
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:10,467
what to do
with myself all day.

80
00:05:12,136 --> 00:05:13,770
I'm a lawyer,

81
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:17,507
well, I...
was...a lawyer.

82
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:20,444
I loved it.

83
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:23,179
But I guess I loved
drinking more.

84
00:05:23,181 --> 00:05:26,533
I know that I can make it down here
with all of you.

85
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:31,238
I just...I'm not
sure I can make it out there.

86
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,575
Anyway.

87
00:05:34,577 --> 00:05:37,294
Thank you for
letting me share.

88
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,387
Thanks for coming.

89
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,840
Sorry about the way
things ended here.

90
00:05:49,842 --> 00:05:52,643
No, don't be.

91
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:54,728
You did me
a favor, Adam.

92
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,681
It was the only way I was going
to hit bottom,

93
00:05:57,683 --> 00:05:59,516
and...

94
00:05:59,518 --> 00:06:01,568
And I did.

95
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,053
How about you do me
a favor now...

96
00:06:03,055 --> 00:06:04,821
come back to work.

97
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,990
You want me back?

98
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,943
I'm looking for someone
to try this case that just came in,

99
00:06:09,945 --> 00:06:12,813
and honestly, yours was
the first name that came to mind.

100
00:06:12,815 --> 00:06:15,415
I'm still facing sanctions
from the bar.

101
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,700
Oh, I got a buddy
on the disciplinary committee.

102
00:06:16,702 --> 00:06:18,168
I squared things for you.

103
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,538
An SCPD raid last night
brought in Frank Bertinelli.

104
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,008
He came back to Starling
to collect on some old debts.

105
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,097
Now, the DA's office
is clear to prosecute him;

106
00:06:27,122 --> 00:06:28,263
for you to prosecute him.

107
00:06:28,264 --> 00:06:30,798
I appreciate the offer, Adam,
but why me?

108
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:33,216
Well, there are Rico counts
that your time at CNRI

109
00:06:33,218 --> 00:06:35,018
make you ideally suited for.

110
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,056
Laurel, it's a case.
If you want it, it's yours.

111
00:06:39,058 --> 00:06:41,257
But only if you're ready.

112
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:50,567
What's the special occasion?

113
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:52,069
I got paid.
So, you know,

114
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:53,537
if you don't think
it's nice enough,

115
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:54,655
you only have
yourself to blame

116
00:06:54,657 --> 00:06:56,540
for not giving me
that raise.

117
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,160
Oh!

118
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:01,828
Roy, I love it.

119
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,049
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

120
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,835
Hey, give me--
give me a second,

121
00:07:08,837 --> 00:07:10,120
I forgot to put
an order in.

122
00:07:10,122 --> 00:07:12,956
Ok.

123
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,958
Hey, what's going on?

124
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,260
I got a line on Michael Statton,
Helena's fiancé.

125
00:07:17,262 --> 00:07:19,462
Felicity, he's been
dead for five years.

126
00:07:19,464 --> 00:07:21,231
Which makes the fact that he rented
a car last night very impressive.

127
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,683
That's Helena.

128
00:07:22,685 --> 00:07:24,518
The car's got GPS,
I hacked into it.

129
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,271
Yeah. She's heading
straight for Starling City.

130
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,074
You ready to get
back in the field?

131
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,410
I thought you'd never ask.

132
00:07:44,956 --> 00:07:46,923
It's over, Helena.

133
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,792
Get out of the car!

134
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,940
Gun!

135
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:15,152
Aah! Don't hurt me!

136
00:08:15,154 --> 00:08:17,454
Stand down.

137
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:20,907
Stand...Down!

138
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:23,744
Don't hurt me!
Speedy!

139
00:08:23,746 --> 00:08:25,162
Enough!

140
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,468
He's just
Helena's decoy.

141
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,005
Where is she?

142
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:36,807
I don't know!

143
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:39,709
Some chick just paid
me to take the car for a joy ride.

144
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:41,878
I swear!

145
00:08:44,715 --> 00:08:47,484
Please don't kill me.

146
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:49,719
I'm getting married
next month.

147
00:08:51,189 --> 00:08:53,273
Just drive.

148
00:08:58,944 --> 00:09:01,163
According to the SCPD,
the guy that gave Helena

149
00:09:01,164 --> 00:09:04,899
a ride into town is a 22-year-old
Poly Sci major at SCU,

150
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,400
and a member
of Gamma Tau,

151
00:09:07,402 --> 00:09:09,285
which totally
explains the whole

152
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:11,938
"I didn't know I was aiding
and abetting a known felon" thing.

153
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,457
Anyone with boobs can get
a frat boy to do anything.

154
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,209
I was a frat boy.
I rest my case.

155
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:18,244
At least she didn't kill
him. That's something.

156
00:09:18,246 --> 00:09:20,664
It's not like Helena
to show restraint.

157
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,774
It sounds like
you have a type.

158
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:24,027
Keep tabs on the police.

159
00:09:24,052 --> 00:09:26,112
Let me know if they get
any leads on her.

160
00:09:26,138 --> 00:09:29,122
I'll do some canvassing.
Hey...

161
00:09:37,481 --> 00:09:39,899
You ok?
Yeah.

162
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:41,735
By this time tomorrow,
it'll be like nothing happened.

163
00:09:41,737 --> 00:09:43,353
That's one upside
to Mirakuru.

164
00:09:43,355 --> 00:09:45,689
The only one.

165
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:47,674
Look, I know what
you're going to say.

166
00:09:47,676 --> 00:09:49,492
I had it under control
last night.

167
00:09:49,494 --> 00:09:52,078
Yeah, so under control that I
almost put another arrow in you.

168
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,997
I was going to back off,
but you never gave me a chance.

169
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:55,281
The only thing that
snapped you out of it

170
00:09:55,283 --> 00:09:57,417
was when
I brought up Thea.

171
00:09:57,419 --> 00:09:59,536
That's why
you called me Speedy.

172
00:09:59,538 --> 00:10:02,872
I--I thought you were
trying to give me a nickname.

173
00:10:02,874 --> 00:10:04,708
But for the record,
don't call me Speedy.

174
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,093
Noted.

175
00:10:07,095 --> 00:10:11,097
Roy, you're dangerous.

176
00:10:11,099 --> 00:10:14,267
I thought I was
helping you control it.

177
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:16,436
You are. I mean, I can't look at
a bowl of water without slapping it.

178
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,224
The first time that you're out in
the field in weeks,

179
00:10:21,226 --> 00:10:24,310
and...you're ready
to kill somebody?

180
00:10:24,312 --> 00:10:26,613
Come on.

181
00:10:28,532 --> 00:10:31,651
I'm sorry, I should have asked
you to do this months ago.

182
00:10:31,653 --> 00:10:33,653
Asked me to do what?

183
00:10:33,655 --> 00:10:36,406
Stay
away from Thea.

184
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,827
No, I--I can't.

185
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:42,829
She's not safe when
she's around you.

186
00:10:44,782 --> 00:10:46,199
I'm not sure anybody is

187
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:49,669
when you lose
yourself to this rage.

188
00:10:49,671 --> 00:10:52,138
You love her.

189
00:10:53,974 --> 00:10:56,976
And that's why you're going to do
what I'm asking.

190
00:10:58,846 --> 00:11:00,930
Such a big uh-oh.

191
00:11:00,932 --> 00:11:02,381
Helena?

192
00:11:02,383 --> 00:11:03,883
Laurel.

193
00:11:03,885 --> 00:11:05,551
Ada Adam Donner

194
00:11:05,553 --> 00:11:07,987
announced the return
of Laurel Lance to the DA's office

195
00:11:07,989 --> 00:11:09,739
after a brief sabbatical.

196
00:11:09,741 --> 00:11:12,442
She will lead the prosecution
of Mr. Bertinelli.

197
00:11:12,444 --> 00:11:15,394
Jury selection starts today.

198
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,166
Hey.

199
00:11:20,168 --> 00:11:22,418
Hey. What are
you doing here?

200
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,004
I heard you picked up
some big new case on the news.

201
00:11:25,006 --> 00:11:26,506
How come you didn't call me?

202
00:11:26,508 --> 00:11:29,092
I was going to, but it
all happened so fast.

203
00:11:29,094 --> 00:11:31,628
Plus, I thought you and dad
would try and talk me out of

204
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,464
going back
to work so soon.

205
00:11:36,016 --> 00:11:37,550
Which is why
you're here.

206
00:11:37,552 --> 00:11:39,219
I'm just worried about you.

207
00:11:39,221 --> 00:11:40,854
If you're worried
I'm going to slip,

208
00:11:40,856 --> 00:11:43,389
I'm still going to two meetings
a day, and--

209
00:11:43,391 --> 00:11:45,859
Laurel, it's not that.

210
00:11:45,861 --> 00:11:48,695
Everybody knows
what kind of guy Bertinelli is.

211
00:11:48,697 --> 00:11:51,781
And not to mention
his completely psychotic daughter,

212
00:11:51,783 --> 00:11:54,400
who's already on her way back
to Starling City to kill him.

213
00:11:54,402 --> 00:11:56,035
How do you know that?

214
00:11:56,037 --> 00:11:58,655
I don't.

215
00:11:58,657 --> 00:12:01,040
I just want you
to be safe.

216
00:12:02,076 --> 00:12:06,162
And I love you
for caring.

217
00:12:06,164 --> 00:12:09,582
But Sara, you've never seen me be
a lawyer before.

218
00:12:09,584 --> 00:12:12,118
And I am really
good at it.

219
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,171
And I miss it.

220
00:12:15,173 --> 00:12:17,307
I have to run.

221
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:19,792
I can't be late
for court.

222
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:29,903
Yeah, this is much better
than the freighter.

223
00:12:29,905 --> 00:12:33,973
You prefer boat, Hendrik,
feel free to swim back.

224
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:36,743
Sara said Oliver
survived here for over a year.

225
00:12:36,745 --> 00:12:38,077
We can do the same.

226
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,864
Unless Ivo and his men
come find us.

227
00:12:40,866 --> 00:12:42,782
We don't know
what happened on the boat.

228
00:12:42,784 --> 00:12:45,869
Who's alive
and who's dead.

229
00:12:45,871 --> 00:12:48,872
Sara, are you there?

230
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:52,792
Slade! Is Oliver...

231
00:12:52,794 --> 00:12:55,295
He's in pain, yes.

232
00:12:55,297 --> 00:12:58,598
But he's still
breathing--for now.

233
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,184
Slade, listen, you won, ok?
You have the "Amazo."

234
00:13:01,186 --> 00:13:05,104
Just let Oliver go,
and then you can leave us here!

235
00:13:05,106 --> 00:13:07,673
Well, here's
my problem, Sara.

236
00:13:07,675 --> 00:13:09,692
I can't leave.

237
00:13:09,694 --> 00:13:12,145
Why not?
During our assault,

238
00:13:12,147 --> 00:13:13,730
the ship's engine
was damaged.

239
00:13:13,732 --> 00:13:15,531
She won't sail.

240
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:18,234
During the attack,
unfortunately

241
00:13:18,236 --> 00:13:20,737
I decapitated
the engineer.

242
00:13:21,058 --> 00:13:24,175
So what can we do
about our problem, Sara?

243
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:25,860
You want Oliver back,

244
00:13:25,862 --> 00:13:28,897
and I need someone qualified
to fix this boat.

245
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:31,066
For Oliver's sake,
I sure hope

246
00:13:31,068 --> 00:13:34,236
a Mr. Hendrik
is there with you.

247
00:13:37,156 --> 00:13:40,542
Non-lethal arrows?

248
00:13:40,544 --> 00:13:44,296
It's not like you
to play with kid gloves.

249
00:13:45,864 --> 00:13:47,549
How's Roy?

250
00:13:47,551 --> 00:13:50,135
Like Helena, he is
not too pleased

251
00:13:50,137 --> 00:13:52,804
with my skills
as a mentor.

252
00:13:52,806 --> 00:13:56,424
Laurel won't drop the case.
She's headed to court right now.

253
00:13:56,426 --> 00:13:58,426
Where are you going?
To the courthouse.

254
00:13:58,428 --> 00:14:00,845
Well, hey,
you forgot

255
00:14:00,847 --> 00:14:03,765
your baby arrows.

256
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:06,217
Look, I get your whole no
killing spree,

257
00:14:06,219 --> 00:14:08,069
but if it comes down
to saving Laurel or killing Helena--

258
00:14:08,071 --> 00:14:10,221
Sara, those aren't
the only two choices.

259
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:12,907
Well, you were happy enough
to let Dig take the kill shot

260
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:14,359
when it was Slade
threatening your family.

261
00:14:14,361 --> 00:14:15,527
This is different.

262
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:19,114
I failed Helena.

263
00:14:19,116 --> 00:14:21,283
I created the Huntress.

264
00:14:21,285 --> 00:14:23,335
Yeah, well,
you created Slade, too.

265
00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:31,909
You're right.

266
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:33,712
You're right.

267
00:14:33,714 --> 00:14:35,297
But when it comes
to our families...

268
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:38,183
Neither one of us
thinks clearly.

269
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:42,420
Which is why you have
to stay here.

270
00:14:42,422 --> 00:14:43,688
Ollie.

271
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,857
I can't.

272
00:14:45,859 --> 00:14:48,643
I'm not going to let
anything happen to Laurel.

273
00:14:48,645 --> 00:14:51,529
I love her, too.

274
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:02,106
What do you guys think?

275
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:05,276
Oh, I think if the Huntress shows up,
you should totally kick her ass.

276
00:15:13,586 --> 00:15:16,671
Please don't tell me
you're worried about me, too.

277
00:15:16,673 --> 00:15:18,673
No, I just wanted
to watch the trial.

278
00:15:18,675 --> 00:15:21,009
I heard the prosecutor
was something special.

279
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:26,348
That's odd.
Why are they bringing him in

280
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,849
through the front
entrance?

281
00:15:32,355 --> 00:15:35,073
Everybody get down!

282
00:15:40,946 --> 00:15:42,747
Hi, dad.

283
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:46,751
Sorry I'm late, but you're a hard
man to track down.

284
00:15:46,753 --> 00:15:49,320
But it's fitting
that you came back to Starling.

285
00:15:49,322 --> 00:15:50,755
Where it all began.

286
00:15:50,757 --> 00:15:52,791
Where you killed
Michael.

287
00:15:52,793 --> 00:15:55,427
You know, I almost
feel sorry for you.

288
00:15:55,429 --> 00:15:57,161
Helena...

289
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,014
Stop this.

290
00:16:00,016 --> 00:16:02,434
Oliver,
you know I can't.

291
00:16:02,436 --> 00:16:04,969
Well, what are you
waiting for?

292
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:09,274
I said, what are you
waiting for?!

293
00:16:10,643 --> 00:16:14,562
Helena Bertinelli,
put down your weapons

294
00:16:14,564 --> 00:16:16,614
and place your hands
above your head.

295
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:18,900
So this was
a big trap...

296
00:16:18,902 --> 00:16:21,736
with you as the bait.

297
00:16:21,738 --> 00:16:23,238
What did they offer you?

298
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,657
Ah, they didn't have
to offer me anything.

299
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:28,376
Give up, Miss Bertinelli,
the building's surrounded.

300
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:31,246
What was it you always
taught me, Daddy?

301
00:16:31,248 --> 00:16:34,132
Be prepared
for anything.

302
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:48,596
Fall back, fall back!

303
00:16:57,156 --> 00:17:00,442
Take hostages,
and fall back.

304
00:17:02,995 --> 00:17:06,080
Hey, hold your fire, hold your fire!
They have hostages!

305
00:17:06,082 --> 00:17:09,233
Hold fire. Say it again, hold fire.
They've taken hostages.

306
00:17:09,235 --> 00:17:11,402
Where's Laurel? Where's Laurel?
Is she with you?

307
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:14,005
I'm sorry, Mr. Lance,
we got separated.

308
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:16,291
She's still inside.

309
00:17:25,565 --> 00:17:27,114
We are live outside

310
00:17:27,116 --> 00:17:29,334
the Starling City courthouse,
where Helena Bertinelli

311
00:17:29,335 --> 00:17:30,968
and an unknown number
of assailants

312
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,053
seized control
of the entire building.

313
00:17:33,055 --> 00:17:34,502
And I'm not being told,

314
00:17:34,527 --> 00:17:36,986
they are holding a number
of hostages inside.

315
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:39,143
I want snipers
with thermals on top

316
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:41,228
of every building
for a two block radius.

317
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,064
This was not how it was supposed
to go down, Captain!

318
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:46,517
You promised me
there wouldn't be any casualties!

319
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:49,353
This was your idea, huh?
You son of a bitch!

320
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:51,071
Hey, my daughter's
in there!

321
00:17:51,073 --> 00:17:52,573
What were
you guys thinking,

322
00:17:52,575 --> 00:17:54,575
putting all those
innocent lives at risk?

323
00:17:54,577 --> 00:17:56,994
Listen! I was following orders.
Orders?!

324
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:04,702
Ms. Bertinelli.

325
00:18:04,704 --> 00:18:06,787
No one has
to die today.

326
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:08,138
My father does.

327
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,790
And unless
you hand him over to me,

328
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:12,126
I'm going to start
killing hostages.

329
00:18:13,878 --> 00:18:17,247
See this,
Mr. Donner,

330
00:18:17,249 --> 00:18:19,300
is what happens when you let
freaks with masks

331
00:18:19,302 --> 00:18:22,102
run wild.

332
00:18:22,104 --> 00:18:24,305
Get them the hell
out of here.

333
00:18:31,564 --> 00:18:34,565
It's my mom.

334
00:18:35,734 --> 00:18:37,818
Detective.

335
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,487
Helena Bertinelli
just took ten hostages.

336
00:18:40,489 --> 00:18:41,905
Laurel's one of them.

337
00:18:41,907 --> 00:18:44,107
Yeah, I'm aware
of the situation.

338
00:18:49,298 --> 00:18:52,333
Oliver, where are you?
Are you ok?

339
00:18:52,335 --> 00:18:54,969
I'm with Lance as Oliver,
and he just called the Arrow.

340
00:18:54,971 --> 00:18:57,221
Oh. Oh!

341
00:18:57,223 --> 00:19:00,090
It's getting really hard to keep track of
who knows whose secret identity.

342
00:19:00,092 --> 00:19:01,892
Felicity, Laurel is still
inside the courthouse.

343
00:19:01,894 --> 00:19:02,977
What do you
need, Oliver?

344
00:19:02,979 --> 00:19:04,795
My work clothes.
I'm on it.

345
00:19:04,797 --> 00:19:06,296
Put Sara on the phone.

346
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:07,898
Uh...

347
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,567
She's not here.

348
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:12,403
Where is she?

349
00:19:41,716 --> 00:19:43,717
Are you one
of the good guys?

350
00:19:45,103 --> 00:19:47,771
No, but I'm friends with them.

351
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,814
Dude, watch it.
Screw you!

352
00:20:10,194 --> 00:20:12,496
Thea, we need to break up.

353
00:20:12,498 --> 00:20:13,997
What?!

354
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:15,749
No.

355
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:17,200
What do you mean, no?

356
00:20:17,202 --> 00:20:18,752
Thea, I'm breaking up with you.

357
00:20:18,754 --> 00:20:20,337
No, you're not.

358
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:22,339
You can't make me date you.

359
00:20:22,341 --> 00:20:24,475
Roy, yesterday
you gave me a bracelet

360
00:20:24,477 --> 00:20:26,510
worth every dime
that you had,

361
00:20:26,512 --> 00:20:28,262
and now what,
you want to end things?

362
00:20:28,264 --> 00:20:31,982
Look, you're clearly going through
something right now,

363
00:20:31,984 --> 00:20:34,818
and I'm not going
to let you go through it alone.

364
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,154
I'm always going
to be here for you.

365
00:20:37,156 --> 00:20:40,107
Sorry, Thea. The guy
from the private party

366
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:42,659
said we stocked the wrong vodka,
and he's freaking me out.

367
00:20:42,661 --> 00:20:45,696
Look, we'll talk
about this later, ok?

368
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:50,834
Oh!

369
00:21:08,853 --> 00:21:10,587
Are you hurt?

370
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:13,757
I'm so stupid.

371
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:16,360
Hey.

372
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:17,694
You don't want
to do that.

373
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,396
Oh, no, trust me.

374
00:21:19,398 --> 00:21:20,948
I do.

375
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:24,234
What about
your sobriety?

376
00:21:24,236 --> 00:21:26,987
How do you know about that?

377
00:21:26,989 --> 00:21:29,406
The "A" chip on
your keychain.

378
00:21:29,408 --> 00:21:31,708
30 days.

379
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:38,949
Do you even know
why I'm here today?

380
00:21:38,951 --> 00:21:41,919
Turns out I'm decoration.

381
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:44,621
Expendable decoration.

382
00:21:44,623 --> 00:21:46,056
What do you mean?

383
00:21:46,058 --> 00:21:48,425
This whole trial was a sham.

384
00:21:48,427 --> 00:21:50,928
I should have seen it.

385
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,263
Sara was right.

386
00:21:53,265 --> 00:21:55,232
Sara, she's...

387
00:21:55,234 --> 00:21:58,435
She's my sister.

388
00:21:58,437 --> 00:22:01,171
She said that I wasn't
ready to come back, and...

389
00:22:01,173 --> 00:22:04,274
I just thought
she was being overprotective.

390
00:22:04,276 --> 00:22:06,777
Well, sisters
can be like that.

391
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:08,412
You should
meet mine.

392
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:10,864
She's gone through a lot.

393
00:22:10,866 --> 00:22:14,051
She must have been so strong.

394
00:22:14,053 --> 00:22:16,286
I just...

395
00:22:16,288 --> 00:22:19,706
I wanted to show her,
show myself...

396
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:23,326
That I was still strong, too.

397
00:22:25,663 --> 00:22:28,765
So show me.

398
00:22:40,678 --> 00:22:43,447
Let's go.

399
00:22:48,903 --> 00:22:50,571
Where are you?

400
00:22:50,573 --> 00:22:52,656
Inside. I've got
Laurel Lance, she's ok.

401
00:22:52,658 --> 00:22:54,124
Is that the Arrow?

402
00:22:54,126 --> 00:22:55,993
I'm headed to an egress point
in the south wing.

403
00:22:55,995 --> 00:22:57,211
Wait.

404
00:22:57,213 --> 00:22:59,379
What about
the other hostages?

405
00:22:59,381 --> 00:23:01,164
You're just going
to leave them?

406
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:02,916
Look, I need
to get you to safety.

407
00:23:02,918 --> 00:23:05,335
I don't understand! What
is so special about me?

408
00:23:05,337 --> 00:23:06,887
What's going on?

409
00:23:06,889 --> 00:23:09,806
She won't leave.
I know Helena.

410
00:23:09,808 --> 00:23:12,375
She's going to kill
all of those people,

411
00:23:12,377 --> 00:23:13,844
innocent people.

412
00:23:13,846 --> 00:23:16,313
You wanted me to
show you I'm strong.

413
00:23:16,315 --> 00:23:20,183
This is me being
strong. I'm staying.

414
00:23:20,185 --> 00:23:23,353
Are you going
to help me or not?

415
00:23:23,355 --> 00:23:26,990
Get her out of there now!

416
00:23:26,992 --> 00:23:29,743
It's not like I can
just knock her out.

417
00:23:29,745 --> 00:23:31,828
I don't want you
engaging Helena.

418
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,997
What, you're afraid
of what she'll do...

419
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:35,532
Or what I'll do?

420
00:23:35,534 --> 00:23:38,401
Sara...You're not a killer.

421
00:23:38,403 --> 00:23:41,004
I am what I need to be.

422
00:23:42,257 --> 00:23:45,459
Sara, did you hear me?

423
00:23:45,461 --> 00:23:47,243
I heard you.

424
00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:50,347
Hendrik's not here.

425
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,637
There's someone
I'd like you to say hello to.

426
00:23:56,639 --> 00:23:58,805
Don't give him
anything, Sara.

427
00:23:58,807 --> 00:24:00,090
Ollie!

428
00:24:00,092 --> 00:24:02,309
One last chance.

429
00:24:02,311 --> 00:24:04,227
Oliver for Hendrik.

430
00:24:04,229 --> 00:24:07,364
I told you! Look,
Hendrik, he didn't make it

431
00:24:07,366 --> 00:24:09,283
to the island, he drowned.

432
00:24:09,285 --> 00:24:12,936
To think it was only a year ago,
you were a little college girl,

433
00:24:12,938 --> 00:24:14,705
fretting about boys.

434
00:24:14,707 --> 00:24:16,323
What's your point?

435
00:24:16,325 --> 00:24:18,441
You're not a good liar.

436
00:24:21,914 --> 00:24:23,880
Slade!
Stop, please!

437
00:24:23,882 --> 00:24:25,716
Look, he's
your friend!

438
00:24:25,718 --> 00:24:29,720
That is the sound of electricity
surging through my friend.

439
00:24:29,722 --> 00:24:31,722
Five milliamps,
to be exact.

440
00:24:31,724 --> 00:24:34,341
Seven causes
cardiac arrest.

441
00:24:34,343 --> 00:24:37,227
Aah!

442
00:24:37,229 --> 00:24:41,064
Oliver just passed out with
six milliamps.

443
00:24:41,066 --> 00:24:43,967
He'll be delivered with
the fatal blow of seven

444
00:24:43,969 --> 00:24:45,990
in one hour if Hendrik

445
00:24:46,015 --> 00:24:48,505
is not standing here
by my side!

446
00:24:50,307 --> 00:24:52,308
There's no way
in hell I'm going back there.

447
00:25:00,702 --> 00:25:02,703
I was almost married once.

448
00:25:11,045 --> 00:25:13,513
It's been an hour,

449
00:25:13,515 --> 00:25:16,166
and I'm a woman
of my word.

450
00:25:16,168 --> 00:25:18,635
Just ask my father.

451
00:25:18,637 --> 00:25:20,721
No, please!

452
00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:33,650
Everything's going to be ok.

453
00:25:40,524 --> 00:25:43,326
Behind you!

454
00:25:48,883 --> 00:25:51,668
Oliver sure does like
to dress up his girls.

455
00:26:14,358 --> 00:26:16,076
You all right?

456
00:26:16,078 --> 00:26:19,863
Laurel! She's
still in there.

457
00:26:25,286 --> 00:26:27,788
Nice to see you
again, Laurel.

458
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:37,013
Helena,
listen to me.

459
00:26:37,015 --> 00:26:39,516
This has to end.
I agree.

460
00:26:39,518 --> 00:26:41,768
And it ends with
my father in a box.

461
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:44,488
The police are never
going to hand over your father!

462
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,106
No, they won't.

463
00:26:46,108 --> 00:26:48,141
That's why you're
going to do it.

464
00:26:48,143 --> 00:26:50,143
Simple trade--

465
00:26:50,145 --> 00:26:52,863
my father for Laurel.

466
00:27:04,298 --> 00:27:05,538
Hey, guys?

467
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:08,073
We need more vodka.

468
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,504
Ok...

469
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:15,140
I'll get it myself.

470
00:27:35,245 --> 00:27:36,662
Where are you taking me?

471
00:27:36,664 --> 00:27:37,963
Safe house.

472
00:27:37,965 --> 00:27:40,282
Listen, front's mobbed
with reporters.

473
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:42,384
Let's take Bertinelli
out the back.

474
00:27:42,386 --> 00:27:43,836
Bring the van
around.

475
00:27:43,838 --> 00:27:46,505
Ow! All right.

476
00:27:53,396 --> 00:27:55,742
Whoa! What the hell?
Don't worry about it.

477
00:27:55,743 --> 00:27:57,058
What's going on?
Just get in the van!

478
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:58,320
Hey!

479
00:27:58,322 --> 00:27:59,988
Hey, hey!

480
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,523
SWAT's getting ready to
breach the courthouse.

481
00:28:01,525 --> 00:28:03,658
Then we make
the trade now.

482
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,944
Listen, I'm not going
to lose any sleep over Frank.

483
00:28:05,946 --> 00:28:08,062
But are you really going
to serve him up to his daughter?

484
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,365
No.

485
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:12,734
No one dies tonight.

486
00:28:13,953 --> 00:28:16,922
Are you ok?

487
00:28:18,157 --> 00:28:19,973
Everything's
going to be fine.

488
00:28:19,975 --> 00:28:23,360
I said...no talking.

489
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:28,198
We talked that night.

490
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,618
You, Oliver,
Tommy, and I.

491
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,820
At dinner.

492
00:28:33,822 --> 00:28:37,824
I remember you telling me
your fiancé was killed.

493
00:28:37,826 --> 00:28:40,761
I'm so sorry.

494
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:43,547
Does this make us
girlfriends?

495
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:46,950
No.

496
00:28:46,952 --> 00:28:50,387
But I know what
it's like to lose someone.

497
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:52,939
Ohh.

498
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:55,008
Poor Laurel.

499
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,277
Did Tommy dump you?

500
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,930
No.

501
00:28:59,932 --> 00:29:03,066
He died.

502
00:29:03,068 --> 00:29:06,420
And I couldn't deal with it.

503
00:29:06,422 --> 00:29:09,906
So I became a drunk.

504
00:29:09,908 --> 00:29:13,026
Every problem I had,

505
00:29:13,028 --> 00:29:15,112
I solved with a pill or a drink.

506
00:29:15,113 --> 00:29:16,541
My friends and my family,

507
00:29:16,566 --> 00:29:18,581
they tried to help me,
but I wouldn't let them.

508
00:29:22,003 --> 00:29:24,537
You don't have
to do this, Helena.

509
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:27,207
It's not too late.

510
00:29:27,209 --> 00:29:29,309
Yes, I do.

511
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:32,846
Because once you let
the darkness inside,

512
00:29:32,848 --> 00:29:35,849
it never comes out.

513
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:44,825
Helena.
I have your father.

514
00:29:45,726 --> 00:29:47,828
Hmm.

515
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,731
I want four men teams,
diamond formations.

516
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:54,000
Move fast, shoot sharp.

517
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:57,421
One more thing--
vigilantes are not the law.

518
00:29:57,423 --> 00:30:00,073
If they're wearing a mask,
they get a bullet.

519
00:30:00,075 --> 00:30:02,459
Let's move out.

520
00:30:05,213 --> 00:30:09,349
Hands up, Bertinelli!
Do it now!

521
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:13,053
Please don't
kill me! Please!

522
00:30:14,807 --> 00:30:17,441
She--she told me--

523
00:30:17,443 --> 00:30:20,861
she told me to wear it
or she'd kill me!

524
00:30:20,863 --> 00:30:22,195
Where the hell is she?!

525
00:30:24,099 --> 00:30:27,567
Don't look so scared, Laurel.
You might just live through this.

526
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,004
So you're just going
to hand me over to my daughter?

527
00:30:44,006 --> 00:30:45,622
I thought you were
the good guys!

528
00:30:45,624 --> 00:30:47,324
Shut up.

529
00:30:47,326 --> 00:30:48,658
Remember all that
stuff I said about restraint?

530
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,294
Forget about it.

531
00:30:51,296 --> 00:30:54,214
Hey.

532
00:30:54,216 --> 00:30:57,367
You can't stop someone like Helena
by becoming her.

533
00:30:57,369 --> 00:31:00,604
I'll do what I have to
to protect someone I love.

534
00:31:02,523 --> 00:31:04,474
Hendrik, please,
put the gun down!

535
00:31:04,476 --> 00:31:06,193
Why? So you can send me

536
00:31:06,195 --> 00:31:07,944
back to that hell hole?
I don't think so!

537
00:31:07,946 --> 00:31:09,396
It's not for any
of us to decide

538
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:11,348
who lives and dies.

539
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,534
But in Hendrik's case,
I'd be willing to make an exception.

540
00:31:14,536 --> 00:31:17,571
I'm leaving.
Don't stop me.

541
00:31:17,573 --> 00:31:21,158
Good at talking,
but you will not kill me.

542
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,994
Let's find out.

543
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,218
Sir, we've got a ping off
Ms. Lance's cell phone.

544
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,636
She must still
have it on her.

545
00:31:32,638 --> 00:31:33,920
Where?

546
00:31:33,922 --> 00:31:36,306
A machine shop
at Gail Street and Simone.

547
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:38,342
Should we rally up there?

548
00:31:38,344 --> 00:31:40,844
Negative.
Hold your location.

549
00:31:40,846 --> 00:31:42,729
Yes, sir.

550
00:31:42,731 --> 00:31:44,381
Sergeant,
keep this position.

551
00:31:44,383 --> 00:31:46,433
Yes, sir.

552
00:31:56,244 --> 00:31:59,529
Well, this is irony
for you, dad.

553
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:01,948
Didn't you have
Jimmy d'Agostino's body

554
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:05,035
buried under
the building next door?

555
00:32:05,037 --> 00:32:07,954
I'm sorry, my girl.

556
00:32:07,956 --> 00:32:11,208
Now you're about to die,
I'm sure you are.

557
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:13,660
No.

558
00:32:13,662 --> 00:32:16,963
I'm sorry for that little girl
I used to take to ballet class.

559
00:32:16,965 --> 00:32:20,684
Go on ski trips with.

560
00:32:20,686 --> 00:32:22,853
The one I used to help
with her math homework.

561
00:32:22,855 --> 00:32:26,273
Oh, she hated math.

562
00:32:26,275 --> 00:32:29,276
Sorry that I caused her
so much hurt.

563
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:34,698
'Cause she brought me
so much joy.

564
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,733
Helena!

565
00:32:36,735 --> 00:32:38,902
Don't kill him.

566
00:32:38,904 --> 00:32:40,487
You can never
come back from that.

567
00:32:40,489 --> 00:32:41,655
It's too late.

568
00:32:41,657 --> 00:32:44,825
I'm already gone.

569
00:32:47,044 --> 00:32:49,663
Bye, Dad.

570
00:32:49,665 --> 00:32:52,499
Damn vigilantes!

571
00:32:52,501 --> 00:32:55,452
You went above the law!

572
00:33:10,735 --> 00:33:13,970
Last time this happened,
I threw you out a window.

573
00:33:13,972 --> 00:33:16,639
I was holding back.

574
00:33:16,641 --> 00:33:18,442
I won't do that again.

575
00:33:47,889 --> 00:33:49,773
Hey.

576
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,325
No!

577
00:34:08,327 --> 00:34:11,495
You're not a killer.

578
00:34:11,497 --> 00:34:13,196
You don't know who I am,
Laurel, not really.

579
00:34:13,198 --> 00:34:15,298
Then show me.

580
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:27,427
No...

581
00:34:34,402 --> 00:34:36,603
It was supposed
to be me.

582
00:34:36,605 --> 00:34:38,405
It was supposed
to me who did it.

583
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:41,191
All right, Bertinelli,
that's enough.

584
00:34:47,031 --> 00:34:49,699
Go.

585
00:35:03,043 --> 00:35:05,945
How did you
get in here?

586
00:35:05,947 --> 00:35:09,986
My family makes a generous donation
to the policemen's retirement fund.

587
00:35:11,136 --> 00:35:13,753
And every once in a while,
I get to call in a favor.

588
00:35:13,755 --> 00:35:16,172
Hmm. Maybe you could
ask them to send me

589
00:35:16,174 --> 00:35:18,341
to prison
somewhere tropical.

590
00:35:21,229 --> 00:35:23,146
You know, I thought
I'd feel different

591
00:35:23,148 --> 00:35:27,416
now that he's dead,
but I don't.

592
00:35:27,418 --> 00:35:31,020
And you always
told me that...

593
00:35:31,022 --> 00:35:33,790
Killing him wouldn't
change anything.

594
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:37,310
You were right.

595
00:35:37,312 --> 00:35:40,413
But I was wrong, too.

596
00:35:41,799 --> 00:35:45,768
About what?

597
00:35:46,954 --> 00:35:49,455
I thought I could help you.

598
00:35:49,457 --> 00:35:52,542
Stop you from being a killer,

599
00:35:52,544 --> 00:35:54,427
but...

600
00:35:56,214 --> 00:35:59,882
I was just starting.

601
00:35:59,884 --> 00:36:03,469
And I was a killer, too.

602
00:36:03,471 --> 00:36:06,639
And what
are you now?

603
00:36:09,393 --> 00:36:11,677
I'm trying to be better.

604
00:36:15,732 --> 00:36:19,151
It's so stupid,
but...

605
00:36:19,153 --> 00:36:23,322
I keep thinking,
now that he's dead,

606
00:36:23,324 --> 00:36:27,243
my father and Michael
are together, and...

607
00:36:27,245 --> 00:36:29,328
I'm still here.

608
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:32,698
Alone.

609
00:36:34,835 --> 00:36:36,969
You're not alone.

610
00:37:01,361 --> 00:37:04,229
What are you doing to me?

611
00:37:04,231 --> 00:37:06,899
In Roman times,

612
00:37:06,901 --> 00:37:08,951
a criminal was branded

613
00:37:08,953 --> 00:37:11,504
to identify his crimes
to the world

614
00:37:11,506 --> 00:37:16,408
and to forever remind
him of what he'd done.

615
00:37:20,347 --> 00:37:23,799
Shado wore this
tattoo on her back.

616
00:37:23,801 --> 00:37:28,304
Now you shall wear
it for the rest of your life,

617
00:37:28,306 --> 00:37:30,556
however short
that may be.

618
00:37:36,363 --> 00:37:38,164
Hello, Sara.

619
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:40,383
I hope you've made
the right choice.

620
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:42,234
Yes.

621
00:37:54,715 --> 00:37:58,167
Look, on behalf of
the entire DA's office,

622
00:37:58,169 --> 00:37:59,885
I have to apologize.

623
00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:03,222
Adam Donner's employment
here has been terminated.

624
00:38:03,224 --> 00:38:05,591
Obviously we had no idea
what he was plotting.

625
00:38:05,593 --> 00:38:07,159
I would hope not.

626
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:10,479
Unfortunately, Adam
was not authorized

627
00:38:10,481 --> 00:38:12,598
to offer you
your job back.

628
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,650
I'm sorry,

629
00:38:14,652 --> 00:38:17,136
but nothing
has changed.

630
00:38:18,638 --> 00:38:22,291
Yes, it has.

631
00:38:22,293 --> 00:38:24,243
Excuse me?

632
00:38:24,245 --> 00:38:27,913
You are going
to rehire me, Kate.

633
00:38:27,915 --> 00:38:30,616
Unless you feel like
explaining to the press

634
00:38:30,618 --> 00:38:33,119
that your own assistant
district attorney

635
00:38:33,121 --> 00:38:37,957
was the brilliant mastermind
behind tonight's hostage crisis.

636
00:38:37,959 --> 00:38:41,260
Welcome back.

637
00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:51,270
I have to say,
I am impressed.

638
00:38:51,272 --> 00:38:54,323
I would have thought blackmail was
a little dark for you.

639
00:38:54,325 --> 00:38:56,125
Someone recently told me,

640
00:38:56,127 --> 00:38:58,961
once you let
the darkness inside,

641
00:38:58,963 --> 00:39:01,564
it never comes out.

642
00:39:14,911 --> 00:39:17,997
Hey.

643
00:39:19,916 --> 00:39:22,835
What are you still
doing up here?

644
00:39:22,837 --> 00:39:24,587
Thinking.

645
00:39:24,589 --> 00:39:26,372
Crying.

646
00:39:26,374 --> 00:39:28,707
Roy and I are...

647
00:39:30,043 --> 00:39:32,678
What happened?

648
00:39:34,264 --> 00:39:38,918
I caught him
with some slut.

649
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,805
Right over
there, actually.

650
00:39:43,824 --> 00:39:46,492
I'm sorry.

651
00:39:46,494 --> 00:39:49,361
He was doing it
to push me away,

652
00:39:49,363 --> 00:39:52,031
which clearly
worked.

653
00:39:52,033 --> 00:39:56,368
I just...
I don't know why.

654
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:59,772
Why is it so hard
for everyone

655
00:39:59,774 --> 00:40:02,174
just to tell
the truth?

656
00:40:02,176 --> 00:40:05,644
I mean, Roy can't even
tell me the truth

657
00:40:05,646 --> 00:40:08,814
of why he wants to
end things with me.

658
00:40:08,816 --> 00:40:12,718
Mom, she...

659
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,087
She keeps all
of these secrets.

660
00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:18,023
I mean, doesn't it...

661
00:40:18,025 --> 00:40:21,494
Doesn't it feel like she's still keeping
something from us?

662
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:29,068
I don't know, Thea.

663
00:40:31,288 --> 00:40:35,407
You're the only one
that doesn't lie to me, Ollie.

664
00:40:35,409 --> 00:40:38,244
You're the only one
I know

665
00:40:38,246 --> 00:40:42,214
who doesn't keep
secrets from me.

666
00:40:43,834 --> 00:40:46,451
Just, I got to go.

667
00:40:46,453 --> 00:40:47,920
Let me drive you.

668
00:40:47,922 --> 00:40:51,590
No, I just want to be
alone right now.

669
00:40:56,963 --> 00:40:58,931
Is she ok?

670
00:40:58,933 --> 00:41:01,233
She will be.

671
00:41:01,235 --> 00:41:03,519
Eventually.

672
00:41:05,572 --> 00:41:08,190
You did good
tonight.

673
00:41:08,192 --> 00:41:11,577
That's what heroes do, right?

674
00:41:46,413 --> 00:41:49,148
It's a dangerous city.

675
00:41:50,617 --> 00:41:52,318
You shouldn't be out
in the streets alone.

676
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,404
Mr. Wilson?

677
00:41:55,406 --> 00:41:58,136
Please.
Call me Slade.

678
