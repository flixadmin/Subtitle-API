I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz,
there was a...disturbance.

forever to Pizza Yurt.

You have to make it in time.

-You bet.

in a way my father never even dreamed of.

-What do you mean?

Oh, the way she looks at you
or doesn't look at you,

Could we get off that subject?

00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,711
[whispers] May.

159
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,422
-May.
-Oh, what, Ben? Hmm?

160
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,549
Wait. Oh...

161
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,092
-Aunt May.
-Oh, my.

162
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,302
[chuckles] Oh, Peter.

163
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:44,889
Oh, for a second there,
I thought I was years ago.

164
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,850
[sighs]

165
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,893
Everybody's gone, aren't they?

166
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,979
Did they have a good time?

167
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,981
I'm sure they did.

168
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,943
-You okay?
-Of course.

169
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,987
But you go home.

170
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,989
And be careful.

171
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:04,826
I don't like that scooter thing
you drive around.

172
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:08,329
I'm worried about you. You're so...

173
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:09,748
alone.

174
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,583
And I saw the letter from the bank.

175
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,793
Oh, my. You did?

176
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,130
Oh, well. So?

177
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,841
I'm a little behind.

178
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,469
Everybody is.

179
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,222
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

180
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:30,226
I'm tired, and you better start back home.

181
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,439
[chuckles] Here, kiddo. Happy birthday.

182
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,399
You need it more than I do.

183
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,110
-No, I-- I can't take that from--
-Yes, you can!

184
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:41,321
You can take this money from me.

185
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:44,240
[crying] For God's sake, it's not much.
Now, take it!

186
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,743
And don't you dare leave it here.

187
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,244
Oh, I'm sorry.

188
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:53,375
[sighs heavily] It's just that
I miss your Uncle Ben so much.

189
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,253
Can you believe that it's...

190
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,674
two years next month since he was taken?

191
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,428
I think to myself at times...

192
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,558
were I to face the one responsible
for what happened, I'd...

193
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:14,062
Oh, I don't know what I'd do.

194
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,650
[sniffles] Oh...

195
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:21,778
Now...

196
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,282
you better take
the rest of your cake home.

197
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,826
[inhales]

198
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,458
[dog barking]

199
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,924
[Mary Jane] Hey.

200
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:45,176
Hey. You're still here.

201
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,887
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.

202
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:51,349
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.

203
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:55,729
Don't be. It's nice.
I get to see you every day now.

204
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,775
I liked seeing you tonight, Peter.

205
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,779
Oh, boy, yeah.

206
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,074
"Oh, boy, yeah" what?

207
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,164
Nothing.

208
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,129
Do you want to say something?

209
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,094
I...

210
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,478
wasâ€¦ [clears throat]

211
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,522
wondering i-if you're still
in the Village.

212
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,864
[sighs softly]

213
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,159
You're such a mystery.

214
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,004
[whispers] Peter.

215
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:05,882
[whispers] What?

216
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,056
Happy birthday.

217
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,900
I'm seeing somebody now.

218
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,986
You mean, like a boyfriend?

219
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,280
Well...like, I like him.

220
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,868
-[quietly] Uh...
-What?

221
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,871
Nothing. [clears throat]

222
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:40,208
That's good, you know? Companionship...

223
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,712
Maybe more than that.

224
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,339
More?

225
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:48,550
[sighs] I don't know.

226
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,095
I'm gonna come see your play
tomorrow night.

227
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,182
You...You're coming?

228
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,351
I'll be there.

229
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,812
Don't disappoint me.

230
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:03,940
I won't.

231
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,572
[footsteps]

232
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,282
[festive folk music playing]

233
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,535
[indistinct chatter]

234
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,372
[landlord] Rent!

235
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,374
[music grows louder]

236
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:25,670
-Hi.
-Hi.

237
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:28,256
-What's "hi"? Can I spend it?
-Uhâ€¦

238
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,052
-I have a paycheck due this week and--
-You're a month late again.

239
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:35,180
-Again.
-I promise as soon as--

240
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,640
If promises were crackers,
my daughter would be fat. [chuckles]

241
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,477
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch,
you know.

242
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,729
All I got is this 20
for the rest of the week--

243
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,981
Ah! "Sorry" doesn't pay the rent.

244
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:48,026
And don't try to sneak past me.
I have ears like a cat.

245
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,111
And eyes...like a rodent.

246
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,448
Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch.

247
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,575
Hi, Pete. Ah! Oh!

248
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,663
[door creaks]

249
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,624
[locks clicking]

250
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,927
[train rumbling outside]

251
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,887
[glasses clinking]

252
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:20,642
[rumbling fades]

253
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,394
[sighs]

254
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:41,496
[knocks on door]

255
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:42,747
Hello?

256
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:44,791
[grunts]

257
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:51,840
Rent?

258
00:18:57,012 --> 00:19:00,807
-Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here.
-[Harry] Nobel Prize, Otto.

259
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,768
-Nobel Prize, and we'll all be rich.
-Yeah.

260
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,395
It's not about the prizes, Harry.

261
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,982
-Nah, but you need money. You need OsCorp.
-Who do we have here?

262
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,859
This is my good friend I called you about.

263
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,694
The guy who got me through
high-school science.

264
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,571
-Peter Parker, sir.
-Parker.

265
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,574
-I'm writing a paper on you for--
-Yes, yes, I know what you're doing here,

266
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,909
but I really don't have time
to talk to students right now.

267
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,704
-[clears throat]
-But OsCorp pays the bills so...

268
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:25,331
That's right. That's why I have
to take off, board meeting,

269
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:26,708
but my job is done here.

270
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,752
Got you two geniuses together.

271
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:32,213
Good luck tomorrow, Otto.
Nobel Prize. [chuckles]

272
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,506
We'll see you in Sweden.

273
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:37,719
Interesting fellow, your friend.

274
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:41,181
-Well, I won't take much of your time--
-Parker. Now I remember you.

275
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:44,559
You're Connors' student.
Tells me you're brilliant.

276
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,479
He also tells me you're lazy.

277
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:51,858
-I'm trying to do better.
-Being brilliant's not enough, young man.

278
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,693
You have to work hard.

279
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:57,030
Intelligence is not a privilege,
it's a gift,

280
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,282
and you use it for the good of mankind.

281
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,659
[operator] You wanna try back there?

282
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:04,537
-So...is that it?
-Yes.

283
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,999
My design to initiate and sustain fusion.

284
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:11,211
Well, I understand you use harmonics
of atomic frequencies.

285
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:15,215
-Sympathetic frequencies.
-Harmonic reinforcement?

286
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,467
Go on.

287
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,221
An exponential increase in energy output.

288
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:23,014
A huge amount of energy.

289
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:27,102
Like a perpetual sun providing
renewable power for the whole world.

290
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,855
Are you sure you could
stabilize the fusion reaction?

291
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:34,275
Peter, what have we been talking about
for the last hour and a half?

292
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,820
This is my life's work.

293
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:40,156
I certainly know the consequences
of the slightest miscalculation.

294
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,492
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to question you.

295
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:46,121
Rosie, our new friend thinks
I'm gonna blow up the city.

296
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:48,081
You can sleep soundly tonight.

297
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,125
Otto's done his homework.

298
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,294
Come to the demonstration tomorrow
and you'll see for yourself.

299
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:56,172
-You need to sleep soundly tonight, Otto.
-[scoffs]

300
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,299
Did Edison sleep
before he turned on the light?

301
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:00,844
Did Marconi sleep
before he turned on the radio?

302
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:03,430
Did Beethoven sleep
before he wrote the "Fifth"?

303
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:06,975
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found
the curves of quickest descent?

304
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,269
Ah, Rosie, I love this boy.

305
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,563
Peter, tell us about yourself.

306
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:15,358
-Do you have a girlfriend?
-Uh, well...

307
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:18,737
I don't really know.

308
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,572
Well, shouldn't you know?

309
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:21,948
Who would know?

310
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:25,285
Oh, leave him alone.
Maybe it's a secret love.

311
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,245
Love should never be a secret.

312
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,665
If you keep something as complicated
as love stored up inside,

313
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,335
gonna make you sick.

314
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:35,503
I finally got lucky in love.

315
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,130
We both did.

316
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,798
But it's hardly perfect.

317
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:40,925

[laughs] It's a terrible joke.

482
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:34,055
But thank you for coming.

483
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:35,515
Today...

484
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:40,353
you will witness the birth
of a new fusion-based energy source.

485
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:43,440
Safe, renewable energy

486
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:45,650
and cheap electricity for everyone.

487
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:49,946
And now let me introduce my assistants.

488
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:02,000
These four actuators were developed
and programmed for the sole purpose

489
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,586
of creating successful fusion.

490
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:07,255
They are impervious to heat and magnetism.

[whizzing]

[clicking]

499
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:57,138
These smart arms are controlled
by my brain through a neural link.

500
00:34:57,222 --> 00:34:59,933
Nanowires feed directly
into my cerebellum,

501
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:02,018
allowing me to use these arms

502
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:07,148
to control fusion reaction in an
environment no human hand could enter.

503
00:35:07,232 --> 00:35:10,443
Doctor, if the artificial intelligence
in the arms

504
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:14,447
is as advanced as you suggest, uh,
couldn't that make you vulnerable to them?

505
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:17,826
How right you are. Which is why
I developed this inhibitor chip

506
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:20,453
to protect my higher brain function.

507
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:24,916
It means I maintain control of these arms,
instead of them controlling me.

508
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:29,587
And now, on to the main event.
Give me the blue light, Rosie.

509
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:31,172
[switch clicks]

510
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:53,194
Precious tritium is the fuel
that makes this project go.

511
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:56,990
There's only 25 pounds of it
on the whole planet.

512
00:35:57,073 --> 00:36:01,369
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn
and OsCorp Industries for providing it.

513
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:03,288
Happy to pay the bills, Otto.

514
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:05,832
[energy buzzing]

515
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:18,636
Ladies and gentlemen...

516
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:23,224
fasten your seat belts.

517
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:27,562

Doctor, we have
a successful fusion reaction.

521
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:47,374
[applause]

522
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:52,545
This is a breakthrough
beyond your father's dreams.

523
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:54,047
Thank you.

524
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,049
[assistant] We're producing
a thousand-megawatt surplus.

525
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,226
The power of the sun...

526
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:08,478
in the palm of my hand.

527

Keep calm! It's only a spike!

00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:34,254
It'll soon stabilize!

-Huh?
-[energy crackling]

538

Otto, please get back! [screams]

539
00:37:56,067 --> 00:37:58,820
Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off!

540
00:37:58,903 --> 00:38:01,823
It will stabilize! It's under control!

541
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:05,493
I'm in charge here! It's my money!

542
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:07,078
I'm in con--

543
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:12,751
This doesn't change anything.

544
00:38:15,754 --> 00:38:18,214
-What are you doing?
-Pulling the plug.

-That was too close.
-If he had more than a drop of tritium,

560
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:17,524
he could've destroyed the city.

561
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:26,533
I'm ruined. [breathes heavily]

562
00:39:26,616 --> 00:39:28,952
I have nothing left, except Spider-Man.

563
00:39:29,035 --> 00:39:33,540
-[assistant] He saved your life, sir.
-He humiliated me by touching me.

564
00:39:33,623 --> 00:39:36,584
Mr. Osborn, the press'll be here soon.
I suggest we move on.

565
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:38,294
What was he doing here, anyway?

566
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:57,856
[doctor] As you can see,
molten metal penetrated the spinal cavity

567
00:39:57,939 --> 00:39:59,524
and fused the vertebrae
at multiple points,

568
00:39:59,607 --> 00:40:02,193
including the lamina
and the roof of the spinal column.

569
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:05,071
We won't know the extent of the damage
until we get in there,

570
00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:07,032
so I suggest we cut off
these mechanical arms,

571
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:10,285
slice up the harness, and if need be,
consider a laminectomy

572
00:40:10,368 --> 00:40:13,872
with posterior spinal fusion
from C-7, T-1 to T-12.

00:40:13,955 --> 00:40:15,290

Yes.

The real crime would be
not to finish what we started.

We'll do it here.

Okay.

1166

And a-a glass of milk?

1167
01:20:37,712 --> 01:20:39,756
That would be nice.

1168

What's going on?

1177
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:37,397
Oh, they gave me another few weeks,
but I decided the hell with it.

1178
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:39,232
I'm moving on.

-I found a small apartment.
-Why didn't you tell me?

1180
01:21:43,111 --> 01:21:46,573
I'm quite able to take care
of things myself.

1181
01:21:46,656 --> 01:21:49,576
And Henry Jackson across the street
is giving me a hand.

1182
01:21:49,659 --> 01:21:51,703
And I'm giving him five dollars.

-That's Henry Jackson?
-[chuckling] Yes.

It's funny what happens in two years.

1185

Nine years old, has great ambitions.

1187
01:22:03,757 --> 01:22:04,966
my last visit...

1188
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:07,344
Pish-posh, we needn't talk about it.

1189
01:22:07,427 --> 01:22:10,013
It's water over the dam
or under the bridge

1190
01:22:10,096 --> 01:22:12,974
or wherever you like it, butâ€¦ [sighs]

1191
01:22:15,518 --> 01:22:19,481
But you made a brave move
in telling me the truth.

1192
01:22:19,564 --> 01:22:21,483
And I'm proud of you.

1193
01:22:22,567 --> 01:22:24,652
And I thank you, and I...

1194
01:22:26,237 --> 01:22:28,198
I love you, Peter.

1195
01:22:29,908 --> 01:22:32,160

01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:54,182
Hey, where are all my comic books?

1198
01:22:54,265 --> 01:22:57,936
Oh! Those dreadful things?
I gave those away.

1199
01:23:00,939 --> 01:23:04,442
-I put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker.
-Thank you, Henry.

1200
01:23:04,526 --> 01:23:07,445
-Hi, Peter.
-Hey, Henry. You're getting tall.

1201
01:23:07,529 --> 01:23:11,658
Henry, why don't you put
those cookbooks in with the mixer?

1202
01:23:11,741 --> 01:23:12,867
Okay.

1203
01:23:12,951 --> 01:23:14,994
You take Spider-Man's pictures, right?

1204
01:23:15,954 --> 01:23:17,622
[Peter] I used to.

1205
01:23:17,706 --> 01:23:20,667
-[Henry] Where is he?
-Henry and I agree.

1206
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:23,086
We don't see his picture
in the paper anymore.

1207
01:23:25,046 --> 01:23:26,548
He...

1208
01:23:26,631 --> 01:23:27,799
uh...

1209
01:23:28,925 --> 01:23:31,136
-quit.
-Why?

1210
01:23:32,178 --> 01:23:35,682
-Wanted to try other things.
-He'll be back, right?

1211
01:23:37,017 --> 01:23:38,643
I don't know.

1212
01:23:39,811 --> 01:23:42,897
You'll never guess who he wants to be.

1213
01:23:42,981 --> 01:23:44,899
[chuckling] Spider-Man.

1214
01:23:44,983 --> 01:23:46,109
Why?

1215
01:23:46,192 --> 01:23:48,987
Well, he knows a hero when he sees one.

1216
01:23:49,070 --> 01:23:52,866
Too few characters out there,
flying around like that,

1217
01:23:52,949 --> 01:23:55,076
saving old girls like me.

1218
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:58,872
And Lord knows,
kids like Henry need a hero.

1219
01:23:58,955 --> 01:24:02,125
Courageous, self-sacrificing people

1220
01:24:02,208 --> 01:24:05,086
setting examples for all of us.

1221
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:07,422
Everybody loves a hero.

1222
01:24:07,505 --> 01:24:11,092
People line up for them,
cheer them, scream their names.

1223
01:24:11,176 --> 01:24:15,347
And years later, they'll tell
how they stood in the rain for hours,

1224
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:20,727
just to get a glimpse of the one who
taught them to hold on a second longer.

1225
01:24:22,604 --> 01:24:25,398
I believe there's a hero in all of us...

1226
01:24:26,608 --> 01:24:28,818
that keeps us honest...

1227
01:24:28,902 --> 01:24:30,487
gives us strength...

1228
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:32,530
makes us noble...

1229
01:24:33,823 --> 01:24:37,410
and, finally, allows us to die with pride.

1230
01:24:38,703 --> 01:24:42,749
Even though sometimes
we have to be steady and--

1231
01:24:42,832 --> 01:24:45,543
and give up the thing we want the most.

1232
01:24:47,545 --> 01:24:49,214
Even our dreams.

1233
01:24:51,341 --> 01:24:54,177
Spider-Man did that for Henry, and...

1234
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:56,513
he wonders where he's gone.

1235
01:24:57,806 --> 01:24:59,557
He needs him.

1236
01:25:04,062 --> 01:25:05,480
Do you think you could...

1237
01:25:05,563 --> 01:25:08,525
lift that desk and put it
into the garage for me?

1238
01:25:09,401 --> 01:25:11,611
But don't strain yourself.

1239
01:25:11,695 --> 01:25:13,238
Okay.

1240
01:25:32,132 --> 01:25:34,384
Strong focus on what I want.

Honey, you sure you don't wanna
invite your friend, the photographer?

1253
01:26:57,509 --> 01:26:58,802
Peter Parker?

1254
01:26:59,678 --> 01:27:02,347
Ohâ€¦ Positive.

1255
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:05,225
-Thought he was your pal.
-Peter Parker?

1256
01:27:05,308 --> 01:27:10,021
-Yeah.
-Uh, he's just a great big jerk.

1257
01:27:10,105 --> 01:27:11,981
Well, the world's full of great big jerks.

1258
01:27:13,358 --> 01:27:15,694
You're adorable.

1259
01:27:15,777 --> 01:27:17,570
It's just the uniform.

1260
01:27:20,573 --> 01:27:22,659
Lean your head back for me.

1261
01:27:22,742 --> 01:27:25,453
-Put my head back?
-Yeah. Just do it.

1262
01:27:27,539 --> 01:27:29,874
-Just put my head back?
-Mm-hmm.

1263
01:27:29,958 --> 01:27:31,501
Okay.

1264
01:27:50,562 --> 01:27:51,730
Wow.

1265
01:27:52,981 --> 01:27:55,275
I'm back on the moon.

1266
01:27:55,358 --> 01:27:56,735
[laughs]

1267
01:27:59,446 --> 01:28:00,989
You up there with me?

1268
01:28:21,551 --> 01:28:23,762
-Hiya.
-Surprised?

1269
01:28:23,845 --> 01:28:27,307
-Very.
-Thanks for coming.

1270
01:28:27,390 --> 01:28:31,811
-Everything okay?
-Uhâ€¦ You might say so.

1271
01:28:33,688 --> 01:28:36,858
This is funny. I'm not sure how to begin.

1272
01:28:39,569 --> 01:28:42,280
You know how our minds play tricks on us.

1273
01:28:42,364 --> 01:28:43,740
Tell me about it.

1274
01:28:43,823 --> 01:28:46,368
Well, mine did a real number on me.

1275
01:28:48,328 --> 01:28:51,915
Some part of me heard what you
had to say after the show that night,

1276
01:28:51,998 --> 01:28:54,334
that you were different,

1277
01:28:54,417 --> 01:28:55,627
but I didn't wanna listen.

1278
01:28:56,670 --> 01:28:58,797
I was afraid to trust you.

1279
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:03,176
Butâ€¦ I've been thinking about it--

1280
01:29:03,259 --> 01:29:06,846
Listen...there's more for me to say.

1281
01:29:10,642 --> 01:29:14,020
I...maybe rushed into things.

1282
01:29:14,104 --> 01:29:15,897
-I thought--
-Wait a minute.

1283
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:18,191
What are you saying?

1284
01:29:18,274 --> 01:29:20,151
I'm saying...

1285
01:29:21,236 --> 01:29:23,113
I...

1286
01:29:23,196 --> 01:29:24,739
uh...

1287
01:29:26,449 --> 01:29:28,952
I thought I could be there
for you, Mary Jane.

1288
01:29:29,786 --> 01:29:31,329
But I can't.

1289
01:29:34,708 --> 01:29:37,836
My mind was playing tricks too.

1290
01:29:42,966 --> 01:29:45,427
Do you love me or not?

1291
01:29:52,684 --> 01:29:54,060
I...

1292
01:29:57,230 --> 01:29:58,898
don't.

1293
01:30:03,319 --> 01:30:04,446
You don't.

1294
01:30:15,123 --> 01:30:16,374
Kiss me.

1295
01:30:18,335 --> 01:30:20,045
Kiss you?

1296
01:30:20,128 --> 01:30:21,880
I need to know something.

1297
01:30:24,632 --> 01:30:26,384
Just one kiss.
