I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz,
there was a...disturbance.

Then not only am I receiving
no money for these pizzas,

but I will lose the customer
forever to Pizza Yurt.

You have to make it in time.

-You'd introduce me?
-You bet.

143

Octavius is gonna put OsCorp on the map
in a way my father never even dreamed of.

-What do you mean?

00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,748
Oh, the way she looks at you
or doesn't look at you,

147

Could we get off that subject?

152

I want us to be friends, Harry.

00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,711
[whispers] May.

159
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,422
-May.
-Oh, what, Ben? Hmm?

160
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,549
Wait. Oh...

161
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,092
-Aunt May.
-Oh, my.

162
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,302
[chuckles] Oh, Peter.

163
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:44,889
Oh, for a second there,
I thought I was years ago.

164
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,850
[sighs]

165
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,893
Everybody's gone, aren't they?

166
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,979
Did they have a good time?

167
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,981
I'm sure they did.

168
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,943
-You okay?
-Of course.

169
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,987
But you go home.

170
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,989
And be careful.

171
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:04,826
I don't like that scooter thing
you drive around.

172
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:08,329
I'm worried about you. You're so...

173
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:09,748
alone.

174
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,583
And I saw the letter from the bank.

175
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,793
Oh, my. You did?

176
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,130
Oh, well. So?

177
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,841
I'm a little behind.

178
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,469
Everybody is.

179
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,222
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

180
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:30,226
I'm tired, and you better start back home.

181
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,439
[chuckles] Here, kiddo. Happy birthday.

182
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,399
You need it more than I do.

183
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,110
-No, I-- I can't take that from--
-Yes, you can!

184
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:41,321
You can take this money from me.

185
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:44,240
[crying] For God's sake, it's not much.
Now, take it!

186
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,743
And don't you dare leave it here.

187
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,244
Oh, I'm sorry.

188
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:53,375
[sighs heavily] It's just that
I miss your Uncle Ben so much.

189
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,253
Can you believe that it's...

190
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,674
two years next month since he was taken?

191
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,428
I think to myself at times...

192
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,558
were I to face the one responsible
for what happened, I'd...

193
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:14,062
Oh, I don't know what I'd do.

194
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,650
[sniffles] Oh...

195
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:21,778
Now...

196
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,282
you better take
the rest of your cake home.

197
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,826
[inhales]

198
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,458
[dog barking]

199
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,924
[Mary Jane] Hey.

200
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:45,176
Hey. You're still here.

201
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,887
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.

202
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:51,349
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.

203
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:55,729
Don't be. It's nice.
I get to see you every day now.

204
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,775
I liked seeing you tonight, Peter.

205
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,779
Oh, boy, yeah.

206
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,074
"Oh, boy, yeah" what?

207
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,164
Nothing.

208
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,129
Do you want to say something?

209
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,094
I...

210
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,478
was… [clears throat]

211
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,522
wondering i-if you're still
in the Village.

212
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,864
[sighs softly]

213
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,159
You're such a mystery.

214
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,004
[whispers] Peter.

215
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:05,882
[whispers] What?

216
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,056
Happy birthday.

217
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,900
I'm seeing somebody now.

218
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,986
You mean, like a boyfriend?

219
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,280
Well...like, I like him.

220
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,868
-[quietly] Uh...
-What?

221
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,871
Nothing. [clears throat]

222
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:40,208
That's good, you know? Companionship...

223
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,712
Maybe more than that.

224
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,339
More?

225
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:48,550
[sighs] I don't know.

226
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,095
I'm gonna come see your play
tomorrow night.

227
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,182
You...You're coming?

228
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,351
I'll be there.

229
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,812
Don't disappoint me.

230
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:03,940
I won't.

231
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,572
[footsteps]

232
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,282
[festive folk music playing]

233
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,535
[indistinct chatter]

234
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,372
[landlord] Rent!

235
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,374
[music grows louder]

236
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:25,670
-Hi.
-Hi.

237
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:28,256
-What's "hi"? Can I spend it?
-Uh…

238
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,052
-I have a paycheck due this week and--
-You're a month late again.

239
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:35,180
-Again.
-I promise as soon as--

240
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,640
If promises were crackers,
my daughter would be fat. [chuckles]

241
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,477
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch,
you know.

242
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,729
All I got is this 20
for the rest of the week--

243
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,981
Ah! "Sorry" doesn't pay the rent.

244
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:48,026
And don't try to sneak past me.
I have ears like a cat.

245
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,111
And eyes...like a rodent.

246
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,448
Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch.

247
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,575
Hi, Pete. Ah! Oh!

248
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,663
[door creaks]

249
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,624
[locks clicking]

250
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,927
[train rumbling outside]

251
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,887
[glasses clinking]

252
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:20,642
[rumbling fades]

253
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,394
[sighs]

254
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:41,496
[knocks on door]

255
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:42,747
Hello?

256
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:44,791
[grunts]

257
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:51,840
Rent?

258
00:18:57,012 --> 00:19:00,807
-Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here.
-[Harry] Nobel Prize, Otto.

259
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,768
-Nobel Prize, and we'll all be rich.
-Yeah.

260
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,395
It's not about the prizes, Harry.

261
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,982
-Nah, but you need money. You need OsCorp.
-Who do we have here?

262
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,859
This is my good friend I called you about.

263
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,694
The guy who got me through
high-school science.

264
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,571
-Peter Parker, sir.
-Parker.

265
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,574
-I'm writing a paper on you for--
-Yes, yes, I know what you're doing here,

266
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,909
but I really don't have time
to talk to students right now.

267
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,704
-[clears throat]
-But OsCorp pays the bills so...

268
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:25,331
That's right. That's why I have
to take off, board meeting,

269
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:26,708
but my job is done here.

270
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,752
Got you two geniuses together.

271
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:32,213
Good luck tomorrow, Otto.
Nobel Prize. [chuckles]

272
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,506
We'll see you in Sweden.

273
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:37,719
Interesting fellow, your friend.

274
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:41,181
-Well, I won't take much of your time--
-Parker. Now I remember you.

275
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:44,559
You're Connors' student.
Tells me you're brilliant.

276
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,479
He also tells me you're lazy.

277
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:51,858
-I'm trying to do better.
-Being brilliant's not enough, young man.

278
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,693
You have to work hard.

279
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:57,030
Intelligence is not a privilege,
it's a gift,

280
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,282
and you use it for the good of mankind.

281
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,659
[operator] You wanna try back there?

282
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:04,537
-So...is that it?
-Yes.

283
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,999
My design to initiate and sustain fusion.

284
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:11,211
Well, I understand you use harmonics
of atomic frequencies.

285
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:15,215
-Sympathetic frequencies.
-Harmonic reinforcement?

286
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,467
Go on.

287
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,221
An exponential increase in energy output.

288
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:23,014
A huge amount of energy.

289
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:27,102
Like a perpetual sun providing
renewable power for the whole world.

290
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,855
Are you sure you could
stabilize the fusion reaction?

291
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:34,275
Peter, what have we been talking about
for the last hour and a half?

292
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,820
This is my life's work.

293
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:40,156
I certainly know the consequences
of the slightest miscalculation.

294
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,492
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to question you.

295
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:46,121
Rosie, our new friend thinks
I'm gonna blow up the city.

296
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:48,081
You can sleep soundly tonight.

297
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,125
Otto's done his homework.

298
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,294
Come to the demonstration tomorrow
and you'll see for yourself.

299
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:56,172
-You need to sleep soundly tonight, Otto.
-[scoffs]

300
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,299
Did Edison sleep
before he turned on the light?

301
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:00,844
Did Marconi sleep
before he turned on the radio?

302
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:03,430
Did Beethoven sleep
before he wrote the "Fifth"?

303
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:06,975
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found
the curves of quickest descent?

304
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,269
Ah, Rosie, I love this boy.

305
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,563
Peter, tell us about yourself.

306
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:15,358
-Do you have a girlfriend?
-Uh, well...

307
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:18,737
I don't really know.

308
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,572
Well, shouldn't you know?

309
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:21,948
Who would know?

310
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:25,285
Oh, leave him alone.
Maybe it's a secret love.

311
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,245
Love should never be a secret.

312
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,665
If you keep something as complicated
as love stored up inside,

313
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,335
gonna make you sick.

314
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:35,503
I finally got lucky in love.

315
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,130
We both did.

316
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,798
But it's hardly perfect.

317
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:40,925
You have to work at it.

482
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:34,055
But thank you for coming.

483
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:35,515
Today...

484
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:40,353
you will witness the birth
of a new fusion-based energy source.

485
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:43,440
Safe, renewable energy

486
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:45,650
and cheap electricity for everyone.

487
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:49,946
And now let me introduce my assistants.

488
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:02,000
These four actuators were developed
and programmed for the sole purpose

489
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,586
of creating successful fusion.

490
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:07,255
They are impervious to heat and magnetism.

[all groan]

00:34:25,857 --> 00:34:28,193
[whizzing]

[clicking]

499
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:57,138
These smart arms are controlled
by my brain through a neural link.

500
00:34:57,222 --> 00:34:59,933
Nanowires feed directly
into my cerebellum,

501
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:02,018
allowing me to use these arms

502
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:07,148
to control fusion reaction in an
environment no human hand could enter.

503
00:35:07,232 --> 00:35:10,443
Doctor, if the artificial intelligence
in the arms

504
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:14,447
is as advanced as you suggest, uh,
couldn't that make you vulnerable to them?

505
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:17,826
How right you are. Which is why
I developed this inhibitor chip

506
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:20,453
to protect my higher brain function.

507
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:24,916
It means I maintain control of these arms,
instead of them controlling me.

508
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:29,587
And now, on to the main event.
Give me the blue light, Rosie.

509
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:31,172
[switch clicks]

510
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:53,194
Precious tritium is the fuel
that makes this project go.

511
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:56,990
There's only 25 pounds of it
on the whole planet.

512
00:35:57,073 --> 00:36:01,369
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn
and OsCorp Industries for providing it.

513
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:03,288
Happy to pay the bills, Otto.

514
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:05,832
[energy buzzing]

515
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:18,636
Ladies and gentlemen...

516
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:23,224
fasten your seat belts.

517
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:27,562

Doctor, we have
a successful fusion reaction.

521
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:47,374
[applause]

522
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:52,545
This is a breakthrough
beyond your father's dreams.

523
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:54,047
Thank you.

524
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,049
[assistant] We're producing
a thousand-megawatt surplus.

525
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,226
The power of the sun...

526
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:08,478
in the palm of my hand.

527

Keep calm! It's only a spike!

531
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:34,254
It'll soon stabilize!

-Huh?
-[energy crackling]

538
00:37:52,939 --> 00:37:55,984
Otto, please get back! [screams]

539
00:37:56,067 --> 00:37:58,820
Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off!

540
00:37:58,903 --> 00:38:01,823
It will stabilize! It's under control!

541
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:05,493
I'm in charge here! It's my money!

542
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:07,078
I'm in con--

543
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:12,751
This doesn't change anything.

544
00:38:15,754 --> 00:38:18,214
-What are you doing?
-Pulling the plug.

545

00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,480
-That was too close.
-If he had more than a drop of tritium,

560
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:17,524
he could've destroyed the city.

561
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:26,533
I'm ruined. [breathes heavily]

562
00:39:26,616 --> 00:39:28,952
I have nothing left, except Spider-Man.

563
00:39:29,035 --> 00:39:33,540
-[assistant] He saved your life, sir.
-He humiliated me by touching me.

564
00:39:33,623 --> 00:39:36,584
Mr. Osborn, the press'll be here soon.
I suggest we move on.

565
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:38,294
What was he doing here, anyway?

566
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:57,856
[doctor] As you can see,
molten metal penetrated the spinal cavity

567
00:39:57,939 --> 00:39:59,524
and fused the vertebrae
at multiple points,

568
00:39:59,607 --> 00:40:02,193
including the lamina
and the roof of the spinal column.

569
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:05,071
We won't know the extent of the damage
until we get in there,

570
00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:07,032
so I suggest we cut off
these mechanical arms,

571
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:10,285
slice up the harness, and if need be,
consider a laminectomy

572
00:40:10,368 --> 00:40:13,872
with posterior spinal fusion
from C-7, T-1 to T-12.

573
00:40:13,955 --> 00:40:15,290
[nurse] We're ready, Doctor.

Yes.

The real crime would be
not to finish what we started.

We'll do it here.

Why does he climb these walls?
What does he think of himself?

Some poor soul got trapped

All right, Billy, let's knock it down
and roll them up.

What I need?

Um...

W-would you like a piece

Okay.

1166
01:20:32,916 --> 01:20:34,834
And a-a glass of milk?

1167
01:20:37,712 --> 01:20:39,756
That would be nice.

1168
01:20:41,174 --> 01:20:42,217

01:21:10,161 --> 01:21:11,788

What's going on?

1177
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:37,397
Oh, they gave me another few weeks,
but I decided the hell with it.

1178
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:39,232
I'm moving on.

-I found a small apartment.
-Why didn't you tell me?

1180
01:21:43,111 --> 01:21:46,573
I'm quite able to take care
of things myself.

1181
01:21:46,656 --> 01:21:49,576
And Henry Jackson across the street
is giving me a hand.

1182
01:21:49,659 --> 01:21:51,703
And I'm giving him five dollars.

1183
01:21:51,786 --> 01:21:53,997
-That's Henry Jackson?
-[chuckling] Yes.

1184

It's funny what happens in two years.

1185
01:21:56,374 --> 01:21:59,627
Nine years old, has great ambitions.

1186
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:03,673
Um...listen, about...

1187
01:22:03,757 --> 01:22:04,966
my last visit...

1188
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:07,344
Pish-posh, we needn't talk about it.

1189
01:22:07,427 --> 01:22:10,013
It's water over the dam
or under the bridge

1190
01:22:10,096 --> 01:22:12,974
or wherever you like it, but… [sighs]

1191
01:22:15,518 --> 01:22:19,481
But you made a brave move
in telling me the truth.

1192
01:22:19,564 --> 01:22:21,483
And I'm proud of you.

1193
01:22:22,567 --> 01:22:24,652
And I thank you, and I...

1194
01:22:26,237 --> 01:22:28,198
I love you, Peter.

1195
01:22:29,908 --> 01:22:32,160
So very, very much.

[sighs]

1197
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:54,182
Hey, where are all my comic books?

1198
01:22:54,265 --> 01:22:57,936
Oh! Those dreadful things?
I gave those away.

1199
01:23:00,939 --> 01:23:04,442
-I put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker.
-Thank you, Henry.

1200
01:23:04,526 --> 01:23:07,445
-Hi, Peter.
-Hey, Henry. You're getting tall.

1201
01:23:07,529 --> 01:23:11,658
Henry, why don't you put
those cookbooks in with the mixer?

1202
01:23:11,741 --> 01:23:12,867
Okay.

1203
01:23:12,951 --> 01:23:14,994
You take Spider-Man's pictures, right?

1204
01:23:15,954 --> 01:23:17,622
[Peter] I used to.

1205
01:23:17,706 --> 01:23:20,667
-[Henry] Where is he?
-Henry and I agree.

1206
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:23,086
We don't see his picture
in the paper anymore.

1207
01:23:25,046 --> 01:23:26,548
He...

1208
01:23:26,631 --> 01:23:27,799
uh...

1209
01:23:28,925 --> 01:23:31,136
-quit.
-Why?

1210
01:23:32,178 --> 01:23:35,682
-Wanted to try other things.
-He'll be back, right?

1211
01:23:37,017 --> 01:23:38,643
I don't know.

1212
01:23:39,811 --> 01:23:42,897
You'll never guess who he wants to be.

1213
01:23:42,981 --> 01:23:44,899
[chuckling] Spider-Man.

1214
01:23:44,983 --> 01:23:46,109
Why?

1215
01:23:46,192 --> 01:23:48,987
Well, he knows a hero when he sees one.

1216
01:23:49,070 --> 01:23:52,866
Too few characters out there,
flying around like that,

1217
01:23:52,949 --> 01:23:55,076
saving old girls like me.

1218
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:58,872
And Lord knows,
kids like Henry need a hero.

1219
01:23:58,955 --> 01:24:02,125
Courageous, self-sacrificing people

1220
01:24:02,208 --> 01:24:05,086
setting examples for all of us.

1221
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:07,422
Everybody loves a hero.

1222
01:24:07,505 --> 01:24:11,092
People line up for them,
cheer them, scream their names.

1223
01:24:11,176 --> 01:24:15,347
And years later, they'll tell
how they stood in the rain for hours,

1224
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:20,727
just to get a glimpse of the one who
taught them to hold on a second longer.

1225
01:24:22,604 --> 01:24:25,398
I believe there's a hero in all of us...

1226
01:24:26,608 --> 01:24:28,818
that keeps us honest...

1227
01:24:28,902 --> 01:24:30,487
gives us strength...

1228
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:32,530
makes us noble...

1229
01:24:33,823 --> 01:24:37,410
and, finally, allows us to die with pride.

1230
01:24:38,703 --> 01:24:42,749
Even though sometimes
we have to be steady and--

1231
01:24:42,832 --> 01:24:45,543
and give up the thing we want the most.

1232
01:24:47,545 --> 01:24:49,214
Even our dreams.

1233
01:24:51,341 --> 01:24:54,177
Spider-Man did that for Henry, and...

1234
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:56,513
he wonders where he's gone.

1235
01:24:57,806 --> 01:24:59,557
He needs him.

1236
01:25:04,062 --> 01:25:05,480
Do you think you could...

1237
01:25:05,563 --> 01:25:08,525
lift that desk and put it
into the garage for me?

1238
01:25:09,401 --> 01:25:11,611
But don't strain yourself.

1239
01:25:11,695 --> 01:25:13,238
Okay.

1240
01:25:32,132 --> 01:25:34,384
Strong focus on what I want.

Honey, you sure you don't wanna
invite your friend, the photographer?

1253
01:26:57,509 --> 01:26:58,802
Peter Parker?

1254
01:26:59,678 --> 01:27:02,347
Oh… Positive.

1255
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:05,225
-Thought he was your pal.
-Peter Parker?

1256
01:27:05,308 --> 01:27:10,021
-Yeah.
-Uh, he's just a great big jerk.

1257
01:27:10,105 --> 01:27:11,981
Well, the world's full of great big jerks.

1258
01:27:13,358 --> 01:27:15,694
You're adorable.

1259
01:27:15,777 --> 01:27:17,570
It's just the uniform.

1260
01:27:20,573 --> 01:27:22,659
Lean your head back for me.

1261
01:27:22,742 --> 01:27:25,453
-Put my head back?
-Yeah. Just do it.

1262
01:27:27,539 --> 01:27:29,874
-Just put my head back?
-Mm-hmm.

1263
01:27:29,958 --> 01:27:31,501
Okay.

1264
01:27:50,562 --> 01:27:51,730
Wow.

1265
01:27:52,981 --> 01:27:55,275
I'm back on the moon.

1266
01:27:55,358 --> 01:27:56,735
[laughs]

1267
01:27:59,446 --> 01:28:00,989
You up there with me?

1268
01:28:21,551 --> 01:28:23,762
-Hiya.
-Surprised?

1269
01:28:23,845 --> 01:28:27,307
-Very.
-Thanks for coming.

1270
01:28:27,390 --> 01:28:31,811
-Everything okay?
-Uh… You might say so.

1271
01:28:33,688 --> 01:28:36,858
This is funny. I'm not sure how to begin.

1272
01:28:39,569 --> 01:28:42,280
You know how our minds play tricks on us.

1273
01:28:42,364 --> 01:28:43,740
Tell me about it.

1274
01:28:43,823 --> 01:28:46,368
Well, mine did a real number on me.

1275
01:28:48,328 --> 01:28:51,915
Some part of me heard what you
had to say after the show that night,

1276
01:28:51,998 --> 01:28:54,334
that you were different,

1277
01:28:54,417 --> 01:28:55,627
but I didn't wanna listen.

1278
01:28:56,670 --> 01:28:58,797
I was afraid to trust you.

1279
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:03,176
But… I've been thinking about it--

1280
01:29:03,259 --> 01:29:06,846
Listen...there's more for me to say.

1281
01:29:10,642 --> 01:29:14,020
I...maybe rushed into things.

1282
01:29:14,104 --> 01:29:15,897
-I thought--
-Wait a minute.

1283
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:18,191
What are you saying?

1284
01:29:18,274 --> 01:29:20,151
I'm saying...

1285
01:29:21,236 --> 01:29:23,113
I...

1286
01:29:23,196 --> 01:29:24,739
uh...

1287
01:29:26,449 --> 01:29:28,952
I thought I could be there
for you, Mary Jane.

1288
01:29:29,786 --> 01:29:31,329
But I can't.

1289
01:29:34,708 --> 01:29:37,836
My mind was playing tricks too.

1290
01:29:42,966 --> 01:29:45,427
Do you love me or not?

1291
01:29:52,684 --> 01:29:54,060
I...

1292
01:29:57,230 --> 01:29:58,898
don't.

1293
01:30:03,319 --> 01:30:04,446
You don't.

1294
01:30:15,123 --> 01:30:16,374
Kiss me.

1295
01:30:18,335 --> 01:30:20,045
Kiss you?

1296
01:30:20,128 --> 01:30:21,880
I need to know something.

1297
01:30:24,632 --> 01:30:26,384
Just one kiss.

1298
