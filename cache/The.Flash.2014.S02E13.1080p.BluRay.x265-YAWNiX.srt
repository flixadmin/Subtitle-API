1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:06,307
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,268
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:13,146
but secretly, with the help of my friends
at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:16,559
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,819
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,776
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,443
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,828
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,622
Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,125
I'm in full-on vibe mode right now.

11
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,832
I wasn't fast enough
to protect Iris.

12
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,996
- I felt slower.
- I did it.

13
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:41,133
I stole your speed. I gave it to Zoom.

14
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,459
Give me back my daughter.

15
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:45,880
Bring me the rest of Flash's speed.

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,631
I told you we're a team.

17
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,517
We're going to help you save Jesse.
We're going to Earth-2.

18
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,763
Journal log entry one-fifteen.

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,275
My last entry on this earth.

20
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:02,105
We're closing the breaches. All of them.

21
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:08,404
Soon, every portal between this earth
and mine will no longer exist.

22
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,948
I've become distracted by this earth.

23
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:14,617
By its problems. Its people.

24
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,160
Twenty-nine.

25
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,828
Twenty-eight.

26
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,671
Twenty-seven.

27
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:20,960
Twenty-six.

28
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:24,673
But the one thing I never
lost track of was you, Jesse.

29
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:27,554
You are my conscience. My beating heart.

30
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,177
You're the reason I've made it this far
in my fight against Zoom.

31
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,015
And now, I Just need you to hang on,

32
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,647
hang on a little bit longer.

33
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:41,436
Because I'm coming to get you.

34
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,607
And this time,

35
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:47,525
I'm not coming alone.

36
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,837
Bam! Uh! That's how it's done.

37
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,123
Whoo!

38
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,628
He shoots. He scores.

39
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,543
- Not bad for a guy who got a C in gym.
- D plus.

40
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,383
Straight up F. Right here.

41
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,138
I can't believe it.
We closed all the breaches.

42
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:13,016
All except the one.
Our last way to Earth-2.

43
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,385
Ready?

44
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,725
Yeah. I just have a few things
to take care of first.

45
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,858
Just a reminder, Allen. Clock's ticking.

46
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,401
It always is.

47
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,075
You know, you haven't made lasagna
since I left for college.

48
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:34,572
Well, college is a hell of a lot closer
than another Earth.

49
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,658
- Ah.
- Hey. Did you tell Henry?

50
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:43,206
No. All right, look, if he knew,
he would just try to talk me out of it,

51
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:46,216
and he probably would so...

52
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,090
Dad, can you give us a minute?

53
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,177
Yeah. I'll make us some coffee.

54
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,731
Look, Iris, I know that this is...

55
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,810
Nuts is the only word
I can think of right now,

56
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,946
but it's not like I've never done
anything dangerous before.

57
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:11,651
Look, I, I get why you're doing this.

58
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,493
Innocent people are in danger.

59
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,620
That's always been the direction
that you've run in.

60
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,703
Even, even when you ran
a little bit slower.

61
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,209
I Just... I want to make sure
that you're not doing this

62
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,794
because you think that you don't have
anything left here anymore.

63
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,549
This isn't about Patty.

64
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:33,756
It's not.

65
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:39,012
I mean, of course,
you know, I miss her. A lot.

66
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,726
But I know what I have here.

67
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,141
I love my life.

68
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,269
I love myjob, being the Flash.

69
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,863
I love you and Joe.

70
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,491
I'm not trying to escape.

71
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,947
I promise.

72
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,829
Go win, Barry.

73
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,327
And then come home.

74
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,876
I will.

75
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,789
All right, Barry, listen to me.

76
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,299
You're about to go through
the looking glass.

77
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,007
You're gonna see things that look
and feel familiar, but they're not.

78
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,466
Up is down, black is white.

79
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,847
And do not let yourself
get sucked in emotionally.

80
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,758
And good luck.

81
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,310
Yeah. Look,
ifwe're not back in forty-eight hours,

82
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,016
that means that Zoom has us.

83
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,807
If that happens,
you have to close the breach.

84
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,270
We're not gonna do that.

85
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,858
You get yourself back here
in one piece, all right?

86
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,694
- Don't make me come and get you.
- No.

87
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,361
I wrote this for my parents and Dante.

88
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,701
If I don't come back,
make sure you get it to them?

89
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,207
Cisco, you're coming back.

90
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,242
Caitlin, please.

91
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,459
- Okay, I will.
- Thank you.

92
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,052
- Be careful, okay?
- Yeah.

93
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,886
- You too, Harry.
- Thanks, Snow.

94
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,684
I hope you get your daughter back.

95
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,220
I'll make sure you get your son back.

96
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,310
You don't have to do this.

97
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,899
Yeah, I do.

98
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,404
Is anybody else feeling panic right now?

99
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,239
I chickened out of bungee jumping
when I was eighteen.

100
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,119
But this is categorically a lot scarier.

101
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,746
Once I turn the speed cannon on,

102
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,533
the three of you will be
able to pass through unharmed.

103
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,326
But Barry, you need to make sure
you keep your speed up.

104
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,710
Mmm-hmm.

105
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,585
- I got no spit.
- Jaws.

106
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,796
And I'm not quoting Jaws. I mean
my mouth is really dry right now.

107
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,633
Do not get distracted by
anything you see along the way.

108
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,839
What are we going to see?

109
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,050
Everything.

110
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:42,634
Do it, Jay.

111
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,194
Okay. Let's go.

112
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,290
Caitlin, look out!

113
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,128
- Are you okay?
- Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

114
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,459
What happened?

115
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,636
With the rest
of the breaches closed,

116
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,474
the energy surge to this last remaining
breach must have destabilized it.

117
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,634
What does that mean?

118
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,647
As long as it's unstable, Barry and Cisco
will be trapped over there.

119
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,164
Holy 2001.

120
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,796
I feel like
I just opened my third eye.

121
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,340
Oh, my God.

122
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,839
Come on.

123
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,098
Wow.

124
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,825
Welcome to Earth-2.

125
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,714
Toto, I've got a feeling
we're not in Kansas anymore.

126
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,424
This is amazing.

127
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,760
Half these things are
just ideas on our earth.

128
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,391
- Come here.
- I mean...

129
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,385
Oh, yeah.

130
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,886
Ah!

131
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,648
- Ramon.
- What?

132
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,104
Not a sight-seeing tour.

133
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,270
Speak for yourself. We want our grandkids
to know we did cool stuff.

134
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,731
- Doctor Wells. Welcome back.
- Henry.

135
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,900
- We weren't expecting you.
- Aah!

136
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:07,822
Yes, I didn't tell anyone
I was coming back.

137
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,540
Well, I thought you might've left town
with all that's been happening.

138
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,622
- Right.
- Are your friends okay?

139
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,419
Yes, they're...

140
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,414
They're fine. They're excitable.

141
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,418
- This is...
- Henry Hewitt. Lab assistant.

142
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,676
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

143
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,009
And, you. I'm Barry. This is Cisco.

144
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:29,347
I'm Cisco.
And you are just a nice, normal guy.

145
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,556
Okay. Um...

146
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,142
Doctor Wells, will you and your visitors
be needing the conference room?

147
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,440
Not necessary, Henry.
Our visit will be short.

148
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,567
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, sir.

149
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,941
He's a bad guy on Earth-1.

150
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,151
He looksjust like him.

151
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,705
A reminder that a
city-wide curfew has been issued.

152
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,743
No unauthorized person
is to be out after 9 p.m.

153
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,708
A recent increase in Zoom attacks
has led Mayor Snart to extend the curfew.

154
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,043
The curfew was first issued

155
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,583
after a series of terror attacks
throughout the city...

156
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,093
It's worse.

157
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,221
It's worse than when I left.
Zoom's turned up his reign of terror.

158
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,928
All right. Then let's find Zoom. Fast.
Cisco, do your thing.

159
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,512
All right, Zoom.

160
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,684
You can run, but you can't hide.

161
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,480
All right. You know what?

162
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,943
You guys are crowding
my space a little bit.

163
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,403
I can't perform like this
under pressure. Okay?

164
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,909
If you could you just step back
just a little bit?

165
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,194
- I need to do my thing.
- All right.

166
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,907
- My mojo. Thank you.
- Yes, all right.

167
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,496
Take two.

168
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:33,782
Hmm. Ha.

169
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,498
All right, Zoom.

170
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,958
You can run...

171
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,299
- Ramon! What's happening?
- You know, I don't know, okay?

172
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,802
I can't see anything.
I don't know what's wrong.

173
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,177
Maybe I lost my powers.

174
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,680
I didn't lose my powers.

175
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,215
Why would you lose your powers?

176
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,383
Here we go.
The wavelength trigger's not responding.

177
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,019
- But that only happens if...
- The frequency is imbalanced.

178
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,604
What?

179
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,645
Our earth vibrates
at a different frequency than yours.

180
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,025
Harry, without that frequency...

181
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,561
We're up a creek.

182
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,025
The latest attack
was orchestrated by Zoom.

183
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:08,783
And we understand that
citizens of Central City are scared

184
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,240
but I can assure you,
the CCPD has been working diligently

185
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,154
- That's me.
- On thwarting the meta-humans

186
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,494
- Yeah, it is.
- Under the leadership of Detective West.

187
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,789
We will stop Zoom. That's a promise.

188
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,625
The leadership of Detective West.

189
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:21,879
So Joe's still a cop here.

190
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,416
Yeah, but more importantly,
I'm still a CSI.

191
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,584
I have a plan.

192
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,553
Whatjust happened?

193
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,217
Doppelgénger!

194
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,936
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
How did I get here?

195
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,769
Who are, who are you?

196
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,399
How do you look like me?

197
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:42,559
Allen, what are you doing?

198
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,272
Harrison Wells.

199
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,648
The Harrison Wells!

200
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,817
Oh, my God, am I in S.T.A.R. Labs?

201
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:54,906
Okay, I have no idea
what is going on here,

202
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,077
but I've always wanted to meet you.

203
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,746
Your thesis on string phenomenology
was revolutionary to me.

204
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:02,958
Oh, man.

205
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,091
I had the magazine laminated
so I could keep it. I Just wanna emulate.

206
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,292
That's incredible.

207
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,835
I won an award for it. Right over there.
Do you see?

208
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,424
Oh, it's beauti...

209
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,548
What did you do? What's wrong with you?

210
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:14,762
Have you turned into an evil you?

211
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,143
Relax. I Just knocked him out.

212
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,475
Oh. But why'd you even
bring him over here?

213
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,310
So he could become him.

214
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:25,022
While you guys work on the goggles,
I will go to CCPD as him,

215
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,109
see if I can figure out what information
they have on Zoom's previous sightings.

216
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,319
We can use those sightings
to triangulate Zoom's hideout.

217
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,324
Okay, that's a good plan.
Just remember what Jay said, okay?

218
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,110
Things here are all sorts of trippy.

219
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,745
Look, I'll be fine.

220
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,326
I can handle it.

221
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,545
Easy.

222
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,256
Whoa!

223
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,522
Whoa.

224
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,809
This is crazy.

225
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,186
Get your hands off me!

226
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,195
Captain?

227
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:15,409
Look, I don't know nothin'
so I ain't sayin' nothin'!

228
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,654
- Okay.
- Deadshot, wh...

229
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,325
That's not funny, Allen.
I hate that nickname.

230
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:26,793
Okay, look, I know I'm not, I'm not
the best shot in the department but...

231
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:31,256
Not the best? Lawton, you are
the worst shot in the entire department.

232
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,715
Hey, why don't you book Singh here
and I'll be in there in a moment.

233
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,505
- Whatever you say, partner.
- Mm.

234
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:36,719
Come on.

235
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,597
Oh, and, just for the record,

236
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:44,189
My marksmanship proficiency ratings
went up by two points last month.

237
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,682
All right?

238
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,850
Two points! Whoo!

239
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,018
Iris.

240
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,115
You're Detective West?

241
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,529
The one, the only.

242
00:12:56,234 --> 00:13:00,614
- Yeah.
- Can I see you for a second CSI Allen?

243
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,866
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

244
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:05,743
Mm.

245
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,203
What are you doing?

246
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,371
What?

247
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:12,083
I think a little office PDA between
a husband and wife is okay.

248
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,385
Husband and wife.

249
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:18,591
Yeah, that's what happens
when you do the vows, exchange the rings.

250
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,599
- Where is your ring?
- I...

251
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,312
People should know
that you're a taken man.

252
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:27,890
That's so weird.

253
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,059
- What's that?
- My meta-human alert app.

254
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,728
It thinks that you're a meta-human.

255
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,362
That is so weird.

256
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,740
Yeah. Must be on the fritz.

257
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,242
- Let's go.
- Where are we going?

258
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,944
Home.

259
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,030
Come on.

260
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:56,344
Where do you people get off
robbing Central City's Royal Bank?

261
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,631
This town belongs to Zoom.

262
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,802
And those of us he deems worthy enough
to enforce his will.

263
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:07,476
Here! Take it!

264
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,435
Thanks a million.

265
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,942
Or should I say two?

266
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,291
No. Wait.

267
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,790
Please don't hurt me.

268
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,796
Hurt you? I Just want to give you a kiss.

269
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,389
Now, what did I tell you about
watching that behind?

270
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,019
I thought that was your job.

271
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:02,243
Good thing, the only man I can kiss
is the only one I want to.

272
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,075
Just got word.
Some breachers came through.

273
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:07,582
Ooh, you know my favorite thing
to do is kill people from other Earths.

274
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,663
Today's your lucky day.

275
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,924
Oh, my gosh.

276
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,346
This is nice.

277
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,559
Our home, I mean. I forgot, I guess.

278
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,617
What is wrong with you?
You've been acting weird all day.

279
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,031
Um,

280
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,078
I'm just not myself, I guess.

281
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,297
Your mom called.

282
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,022
Allen residence.

283
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,528
Hello?

284
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:24,942
Uh, hello?

285
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,281
Mom.

286
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,617
Well, you certainly took your time
calling back.

287
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:35,371
Yeah. I'm sorry about that.

288
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,090
Thank you so much for
the anniversary tickets to Atlantis.

289
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,922
Your dad and I have always wanted to go.

290
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,680
I'm really glad you liked them.

291
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,264
Are you okay?

292
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,925
You sound kind of strange.

293
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,312
I'm fine. I'm...

294
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:56,941
Hey, lknow. Maybe Ishould give
the plane tickets to you and Iris.

295
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,772
A nice little romantic getaway.

296
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,905
You two could get started on
giving me a grandchild.

297
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,240
No, I want you to use them.

298
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:10,948
I'm really glad to hear you happy, Mom.

299
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,956
Aw. I love you, Barry.

300
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,037
I love you, too.

301
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,001
Okay. Bye-bye, honey-

302
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,011
Baby, what's wrong?

303
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,171
Um, nothing.

304
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,933
I was just, uh... I mean,
it was just good to talk to my mom.

305
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,641
We should get ready, yeah?

306
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,431
Yeah. All right.

307
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,235
Where is he? Where is he?

308
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:50,654
I don't know. I can't find him anywhere.

309
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,165
Yeah, well, he better show up soon
because he's been gone for hours.

310
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,372
We only have so many of those left
before Zoom needs the speed.

311
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,663
You're talking about Barry.

312
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,001
Yeah.

313
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,836
Yeah, don't worry about him.
He'll be fine.

314
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,299
Who'd you think I was talking about?

315
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,926
- I thought you were talking about me.
- You?

316
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,177
Yeah. 'Cause we found Barry's double,

317
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,588
so where the hell am I?

318
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,507
You know, I always thought,
in another life, I was, like,

319
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:15,429
I don't know, like, a really wealthy,
famous inventor.

320
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,939
You know, sort of
like the Earth-2 Elon Musk.

321
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,520
Only with less RBF, obviously.

322
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,185
Well, here's some advice for you.

323
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,228
How about spending
more time looking for Zoom

324
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:27,865
and less time worrying about what someone,
who is not you, is doing with their life.

325
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:40,204
Some things that happened
for the first time

326
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:45,549
Seem to be happening again

327
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,637
And so it seems that we have met before

328
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,516
And laughed before

329
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,604
And loved before

330
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,060
Whoa. Joe can sing.

331
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,858
- He's the best.
- Right.

332
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,065
But who knows, baby now, who knows

333
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,946
Yeah, who knows

334
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,575
Where or when

335
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,489
Whoo.

336
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,542
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

337
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,585
Mm. Oh, yeah.

338
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:24,623
- Joe, hey!
- Lt's Joseph, Bartholomew.

339
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:28,293
Pop, be nice. You too, babe.
I'll be right back.

340
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:29,926
Yeah.

341
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,221
So you're a singer!

342
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,806
So you're still an idiot.

343
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,480
Are you upset with me?

344
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,104
Or you just don't like me.

345
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,897
Have you lost your mind?

346
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,486
Central City is going to
hell-in-a-hand basket

347
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,868
because this lunatic, Zoom,
is running around, killing folks,

348
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,243
and you got my daughter
on the front lines.

349
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,155
Wait, wha... Me?

350
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,451
It is always been about you, Bartholomew.

351
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,496
You're the most selfish person
I've ever met, and I'm a musician.

352
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:05,959
We're all selfish.

353
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,796
You wanted to get your PhD
so you could further your career,

354
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,632
she had to become a police officer
to pay your tuition.

355
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:15,515
We both know that she'd be safer
going back to write at the newspaper.

356
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,266
Oh, Dad, please stop.

357
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,686
CCPN was an internship.

358
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,394
All I did was get coffee for real writers.

359
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,067
Being a cop, like Grandpa, is what I love.

360
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,524
You raised me to be tough, and I am.

361
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,403
Everything's fine.

362
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,818
I mean, we're here to have fun, right?

363
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,534
Right. Everything's great.

364
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,165
How's it going?

365
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:53,802
Uh, slow. Which is not a good adjective
when it comes to a speed cannon.

366
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,678
Well, we got another problem.

367
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,514
Why do we always have to have
another problem?

368
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,179
You've gotta see this!

369
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,394
Somebody call the Flash!

370
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,693
His name is Adam Fells

371
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,366
but he calls himself Geomancer.

372
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,318
So this meta-human is a breacher?

373
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:18,862
No. Fells died on my Earth.

374
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,826
This must be his Earth-1 doppelganger.

375
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,911
Well, at least now that we know his name.

376
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,034
Might be a little easier
to track him down.

377
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,373
Yeah, but with Barry gone,

378
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,879
how are we gonna stop him
even if we do find him?

379
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:33,634
Jay, if you could shoot yourself up
with that stuff, or was it Velocity...

380
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,046
- Velocity-Six?
- I cannot take V-Six.

381
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,509
But it gave you your speed back

382
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,423
long enough to get that bullet
out of Wells. Saved his life.

383
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,550
Joe, don't ask me
to take Velocity-Six again.

384
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,719
Look, Jay, I'm not trying
to tell you what to do.

385
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,388
But Barry is protecting your world,

386
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,227
and our world needs
a Flash right about now.

387
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,615
Jay.

388
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,785
Caitlin, I like the way
you look at me.

389
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:04,040
With warmth and pride.
And I'm not, I'm not worthy of those.

390
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:07,327
- Yes, you are.
- No. I did a terrible thing, Caitlin.

391
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,584
When my world's
Particle Accelerator went off,

392
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,248
I became a speedster.

393
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,041
I became the Fastest Man Alive.

394
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,553
Only, only it wasn't enough for me.

395
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,964
I wasn't fast enough.

396
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:22,762
So I figured
with my scientific background,

397
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,472
I could increase my powers.

398
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,062
I did.

399
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,483
So you've taken Velocity-Six before.

400
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:31,642
Yes.

401
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:37,068
But there were some
unforeseen side effects.

402
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,404
This is why
you didn't want Barry to take it.

403
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,194
Or even know about it.

404
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,997
Zoom never stole your speed.

405
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,032
This is what's making you sick.

406
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,911
Velocity-Six is killing you.

407
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,421
I wasn't lying when I said
that stuff was dangerous.

408
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,126
I've made so many mistakes.

409
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,430
You have something now
that you've never had before.

410
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,681
Me.

411
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:05,805
And I'm going to figure this out.

412
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:15,274
My funny valentine

413
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:21,158
Sweet comic valentine

414
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:28,708
Can we talk some more about
why Joseph doesn't like me?

415
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,416
What's there to talk about?

416
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,787
I mean, you can't stand him either.

417
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,165
- Right.
- Look...

418
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,544
I can love you both
even if you don't love each other.

419
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,849
My meta-human warning app.

420
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,936
Don't stop singing, old man.

421
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,812
That's our song.

422
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,862
So,

423
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:08,782
which one of you lounge lizards
is in the wrong universe?

424
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,458
Hmm? Show of hands.

425
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,877
Don't be shy.

426
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:17,544
Hey, no, no. Hey, no, no, don't.

427
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,333
Hey, handsome.

428
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,464
You got something you want to tell me?

429
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,846
- No.
- No?

430
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,808
Baby, no one's talking to me.

431
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,143
What if I make them scream?

432
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,058
CCPD! Everyone get out of here!

433
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:39,104
- All right, go, go.
- You are both under arrest!

434
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,904
Ladies first.

435
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,233
Caitlin.

436
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,245
I haven't heard that name in a long time.

437
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,077
But that is your name, isn't it?

438
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,743
Your real name. Please.

439
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:57,128
I know you. Don't do this.

440
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,541
If you knew me at all,

441
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,836
you would know
that I hate the name "Caitlin."

442
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,884
I'm Killer Frost.

443
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,551
Go, all right. Go, go!

444
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,429
Iris, look out!

445
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:19,276
Dad! Oh, my God.

446
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,113
Well, hello, breacher.

447
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,028
He's a speedster, babe.

448
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,617
Oh, I'm shivering.
I've been dying to kill the Flash.

449
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,665
I don't want to hurt you.

450
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:35,872
Trust me. You won't.

451
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,502
Kill him!

452
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,350
Come on.

453
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,557
God, this is making me so hot!

454
00:25:54,581 --> 00:25:56,581
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

455
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,127
This ain't over, breacher.

456
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,383
Barry!

457
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,257
Oh, my God.

458
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,673
Dad. Barry.

459
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,727
- Killer Frost and Deathstorm.
- You know them?

460
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:38,184
More importantly, they know you now.
They know that you're here.

461
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,354
So Caitlin and Ronnie's
doppelgangers are evil?

462
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,360
Those are some dope names, though.

463
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,521
This was supposed to be
a surgical mission, Allen.

464
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:49,408
Find Zoom's lair. Rescue Jesse.
Get in, get out. Not get involved.

465
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,944
All right, well look, I am involved, okay?

466
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,034
Joe is in the hospital.
They nearly killed him.

467
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:59,123
No, he isn't. Joe West, your Joe West,
is alive and safe on your earth.

468
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,752
So is Caitlin, so is Iris.

469
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:03,209
These people, Barry,
they're mere reflections.

470
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:06,751
As far as your life is concerned,
they don't exist.

471
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,594
Killer Frost, Deathstorm,
they know that you're here,

472
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,426
and it's not long before Zoom does too

473
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:12,589
and then my daughter's dead.

474
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:13,966
And that's on you.

475
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,974
Jesse still has time, okay?
Iris and Joe need me now.

476
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,730
- She is not Iris!
- I have to get back to them.

477
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,016
She is Iris! Okay? She is to me.

478
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:25,436
No matter what Universe I am in,
they are my family.

479
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,401
I would think by now, you should get
how important family is.

480
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,657
I'm going, Wells. I have to.

481
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,863
Find Zoom.

482
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,756
Iran Adam Fells through BCI.

483
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,713
Not exactly a model citizen
before he was a meta-human.

484
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:50,674
Multiple counts of robbery and assault.

485
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,463
Well, if he thinks he's gonna use my city

486
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,882
for a steel cage death match
with the Flash,

487
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,096
he's got another thing coming.

488
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,270
Hey, what are you doing here? Wait.

489
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:01,726
Were we supposed to meet up or something?

490
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,766
Nah, I was just nearby.

491
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:11,903
Everybody Okay?

492
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:15,160
Fells has been spotted.
Pasko and fourth. Go.

493
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,497
I got to go, son.

494
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,615
Joe...

495
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,298
Mm.

496
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,180
Dad, are you okay?

497
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,053
Mm.

498
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,226
Damn meta-humans.

499
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,647
Only thing I hate more...

500
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:51,818
Is hospitals.

501
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,069
Are you okay?

502
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:58,700
Yeah.

503
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,743
I'm just worried about you.

504
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,835
There's a first.

505
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,122
Baby...

506
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,584
Yeah, yeah.

507
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:19,433
You ever notice every time,
just before I do a number,

508
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:23,137
I close my eyes for a hot second,
and I take a deep breath.

509
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:25,647
You ever wonder what I was doing?

510
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:28,692
Trying to remember the lyrics?

511
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:36,571
I say a little mantra to myself
every time before I sing.

512
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,496
"This one is for Iris."

513
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,700
"My baby girl."

514
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,044
Every song's for you, baby.

515
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,711
Every single one.

516
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,384
Dad, don't talk like this, okay?

517
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,800
Barth... Barry.

518
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:01,967
Yeah.

519
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:07,389
You take care of her.

520
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,945
Dad!

521
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,106
Dad!

522
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:17,274
Dad! Nurse!

523
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,071
Doctor! Nurse! Dad!

524
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,244
Iris.

525
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,741
No! No! No!

526
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,253
No! No!

527
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:31,629
It's okay.

528
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,762
Oh, damn it. Ugh.

529
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,272
You don't have to do this, Lawton.

530
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:52,939
We're partners, right?
You've always had my back.

531
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:54,770
And I've got yours.

532
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:58,903
Oh, Iris.

533
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,485
- Do I know you?
- Does she know me?

534
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:05,121
Uh, this is my good friend, Cisco Ramon.

535
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,040
- "Good friend"?
- Yeah.

536
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,785
Cisco works at S.T.A.R. Labs,

537
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,953
and he has built a weapon that he believes

538
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,249
we can use to neutralize, um,
Killer Frost's powers.

539
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,425
Great. Thanks. I'll take it.

540
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,963
Uh, please, I should really take this.

541
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:23,883
All right.

542
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:27,682
One of my snitches gave me a lead
on Killer Frost and Deathstorm's location.

543
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:28,845
We're going to bring them in.

544
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,980
Okay. I'm coming with you, Iris.

545
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:35,110
No, Barry. I Just lost my father.
I cannot lose my husband too.

546
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,313
All right. Well, Cisco is the only one
that knows how to operate the device.

547
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,606
So you have to take him.

548
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,821
I can't put a civilian in harm's way.

549
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,530
Look, I've seen fire and I've seen rain.

550
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:47,914
I can handle myself, okay?
Mrs. West Allen.

551
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,832
I love you.

552
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:01,841
I love you too.

553
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,638
- Lawton, let's move!
- Yeah.

554
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,765
Uh...

555
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,722
We got to work on finding Jesse.

556
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,140
Are you sure this is
what you want to be doing?

557
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,307
Iam, all right?

558
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,226
Right now, we have to help Iris.

559
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,612
Just make sure no one else gets hurt.

560
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,966
CCPD! It's over, Fells.

561
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:44,255
No offense to you boys in blue
but I'm waiting on the man in red.

562
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,549
You better hope the Flash doesn't show up,
or you're finished.

563
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,058
See, that's funny.

564
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,014
I don't think he will show.

565
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:54,478
I've been causing tremors for days
and no sign of him.

566
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,892
I think he's gone.

567
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,526
What is it they say in boxing?

568
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,781
Let's get ready to rumble!

569
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,702
What the...

570
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,328
I heard you were looking for the Flash.

571
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,247
Looks like the Velocity-Seven is working.

572
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,131
Now go get him!

573
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:28,132
- That's a new one.
- Is that all you have?

574
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,728
You don't ever want to see all I have.

575
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,314
The Velocity-Seven's wearing off!

576
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:46,699
You've heard what an eight
on the Richter scale can do to a city.

577
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,611
Imagine what it's going to do
to your skull.

578
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:02,753
Are you hurt?

579
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,338
Only my pride.

580
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,378
And my body.

581
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,258
Pride and my body.

582
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,321
Are you really sure this is the place?

583
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,066
Maybe you should stay in the car, Lawton.

584
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,237
Look alive, gents.

585
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,217
Hey, maybe, maybe your snitch was wrong.

586
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,633
I mean, maybe they're not even here.

587
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:56,852
No, they're here.

588
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,894
You didn't knock.

589
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,397
How rude.

590
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,030
Drop them.

591
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,205
Ronnie?

592
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,005
Is Martin Stein in there?

593
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,709
Oh, I haven't let him out in years.

594
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,379
He doesn't talk much anymore.

595
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,639
You killed my father, you evil bitch.

596
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,266
He shouldn't have pal-ed
around with a breacher.

597
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:37,519
That's a big no-no
as far as Zoom's concerned.

598
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,395
I can't believe you two work for Zoom.

599
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,558
No, they work for me.

600
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,231
Iwork for Zoom.

601
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,694
Who the hell are you?

602
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:56,829
Well, that's funny.

603
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,162
I wasjust going to ask you
the same thing.

604
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,381
D0ppel... '... 93r1ger.

605
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,134
What the hell is going on here?

606
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,422
Are you two related to each other?

607
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,432
Oh, I knew there was another "me" here!

608
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,264
And I knew you were coming, Cisco.

609
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,894
Even before you entered the breach

610
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:21,726
and set foot on this world.

611
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:27,144
See, we're all connected, Francisco.

612
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,104
The name is Vibe.

613
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:31,773
Reverb.

614
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,909
Actually not the worst name
you could've come up with.

615
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,783
But not the best.

616
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,456
I've been watching you, Vibe.

617
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:44,040
And I have to say,
I am extremely disappointed.

618
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,212
Yeah? I know the feeling.

619
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:47,497
I'm not sure what's worse.

620
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:49,166
The fact that you're part of Zoom's gang

621
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:52,802
or that weird samurai situation you got
going on on the top of your head there.

622
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,467
Listen to this.

623
00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:00,056
What if Zoom wasn't
running the show anymore?

624
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,599
- What do you mean?
- You don't even know how powerful you are.

625
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:08,485
All you use your powers for
are these cheap parlor tricks,

626
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,817
when you, you could be a God.

627
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:15,450
We could be Gods.

628
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,666
Are you Cloud City Vadering me right now?

629
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,494
Are you out ofyour mind?

630
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,839
Let's turn them over to Zoom.

631
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,171
Speak to me like that again

632
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,257
and I will shatter your entire nervous
system without breaking a sweat.

633
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,008
So...

634
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,185
Vibe...

635
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,063
D0 you wanna run Central City?

636
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,023
What do you say?

637
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,236
I say...

638
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,693
Flash save us!

639
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,369
Hey. That didn't hurt you, did it?

640
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,200
- No. Why would it?
- I don't know.

641
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,363
And who the hell are you?

642
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,373
Look, Detective,
just get out of here, all right?

643
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,624
No. Not without them!

644
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,004
Stay here!

645
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,142
Round two.

646
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:27,560
Look, Mirror Mirror, I already told you.
I'm not going to the dark side with you.

647
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,566
You're a rotten shot.

648
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,079
I'm not.

649
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,536
Are you telling me I can do that?

650
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,579
I can show you.

651
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,506
No!

652
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:06,390
Stop! The both of you!

653
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:08,351
Zoom wanted him alive!

654
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,891
You know what Zoom will do
if you don't obey him!

655
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,569
No!

656
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,235
That.

657
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,822
What did I say you should do

658
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,784
if you encountered a speedster?

659
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,707
Leave him unharmed.

660
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:37,133
Does this look unharmed to you?

661
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,557
I'm happy to see

662
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:58,063
at least one of you knows their place.

663
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,862
Barry!

664
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,997
No.

665
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,786
No.

666
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:30,141
Sorry. Did I forget to say
this might sting?

667
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:34,190
It's not my first road rash.
I'm a speedster, remember?

668
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,568
You made sure
no one will forget that tonight.

669
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,227
Thanks to you.

670
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,480
Velocity-Seven held up pretty well.

671
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:42,194
Moving on to Velocity-Eight.

672
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:43,700
I'm gonna figure it out. I swear.

673
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,863
I just need you to figure out
how to restabilize the breach.

674
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,203
Barry, Cisco, and Wells
still have twenty-four hours to go.

675
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,542
So we have one day,

676
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,374
or they could be stuck there forever.

677
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,078
Jesse.Jesse.

678
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,573
Hey. I'm here with your dad.

679
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:33,909
We're gonna get you out of here,
all right? I promise.

680
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:41,128
It's not wise to make promises

681
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,760
you can't keep, Flash.

682
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,222
Look around.

683
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,892
This is the last place

684
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,015
you'll ever see.

685
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:05,039
