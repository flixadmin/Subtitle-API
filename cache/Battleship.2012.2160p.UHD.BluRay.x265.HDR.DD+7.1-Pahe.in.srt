00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:30,258
NOGRADY: <i>Today really
marks the first stage</i>

2
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:33,719
<i>of an unprecedented
technological advancement.</i>

3
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:38,057
We have begun to identify
so-called Goldilocks planets.

4
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:40,851
These are planets that share a
similar relationship with their sun

5
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,144
<i>as we have with ours.</i>

6
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:45,106
<i>If a planet's too far away from its
sun, it's too cold.</i>

7
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,857
<i>If it's too close to
its sun, it's too hot.</i>

8
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:50,111
<i>But for an Earth-like planet,
the distance is just right.</i>

9
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:52,780
<i>Potentially perfect
for sustaining life.</i>

10
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,951
We have finally managed
to identify one planet

11
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,705
<i>that is the right distance
from its star to hold water</i>

12
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:03,708
<i>and is the right mass
to sustain an atmosphere.</i>

13
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,795
<i>Every 24 hours,
our station in Hawaii</i>

14
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:12,591
<i>will transmit a signal to Landsat
7, our deep orbiting satellite,</i>

15
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:16,887
which will amplify and relay the
signal to our targeted planet

16
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:21,225
which is, rather grandly,
entitled Planet G.

17
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:24,478
If there is intelligent life
out there, and they come here

18
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:27,606
it's going to be like
Columbus and the Indians.

19
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,525
Only, we're the Indians.

20
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:35,239
Ladies and gentlemen, please prepare to
bear witness to the making of history.

21
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:37,575
Start transmission.

22

JACKIE: <i>It seems as though
NASA is setting up shop</i>

23
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,939

<i>Today, the Beacon International

29
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:23,287
JACKIE: <i>...or anything that
might be out there listening.</i>

30
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:24,705
A toast.

31
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:26,123
Happy birthday, little brother.

32
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:29,627
I'm wishing you success and
growth, and happiness.

33
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,254
May this be
a great year for you.

34
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:33,798
It's going to be a great year.

35
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,925
I love you.
I love you, too.

36
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:40,888
So, in the great
Hopper family tradition,

37
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:44,225
this year I'm quoting
from Coach John Wooden.

38
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,851
Johnny.

39
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:49,230
"Adversity is
the state in which man

40
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,649
"most easily becomes
acquainted with himself

41
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:55,319
"being especially free
of admirers then."

42
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:56,654
Cheers.

43
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:58,823
I'm not cheers-ing that.

44
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,074
It's a very good quote for you.

45
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,785
"I may be free of admirers right
now but there is still time"?

46
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,078
Will you shut up?

47
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,454
Light your cupcake
and raise your glass.

48
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:06,956
Did you get me that?

49
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,457
Yes, I got you that.

50
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:09,959
Thank you, that's very sweet.

51
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,502
You're welcome.
You're very welcome.

52
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:18,092
I got this guy, Tony.
He said he can get you a construction job.

53
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,427
All you need to do is call him.

54
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,179
Could I get a beer and a
chicken burrito, please?

55
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:24,432
Sorry, kitchen's closed.

56
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:25,724
STONE: You're not going
to call him, are you?

57
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,519
Give Tony my best,
but I don't need you

58
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,479
or Tony's help, for that matter.

59
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:33,190
You can call him or
join me in the Navy.

60
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:35,693
No.
Great. All right.

61
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,280
Happy birthday.
Blow out your candle and make a wish.

62
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,117
Do not waste a wish on a girl.

63
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,286
Wish for a job, an apartment.

64
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,913
A new alternator belt,
so I don't have to drive you everywhere.

65
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:50,374
A job, or...
You said "job" twice.

66
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:54,044
It's my birthday and my wish.

67
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:55,963
All right?

68
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,965
Please don't waste it.

69
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,261
You just wasted
that wish, didn't you?

70
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,345
I'm going in.
You're not going in.

71
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:04,763
How do I look?

72
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:06,682
Wait, let me just fix that.

73
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:07,933
Awesome!

74
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:09,393
All right, princess, go get 'em.

What seems to be the problem?

78
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,243
I want a chicken burrito.

79
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,454

He loves his daughter, she loves you.
He's going to respect that.

Hey, Mike.

317
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:26,273
You remember Sam?

318
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:29,109
It's an obsolete tradition,
this asking for permission.

319
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,777
Tell me where this came from.
Stop.

320

Sam's a physical therapist now.

321
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:35,365
Stop worrying about this and walk
up and do what you got to do.

322
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:36,783
Hello, Hopper.

323

Why are you here?

324
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,580
This is going to be sweet.

325
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,499
I was within the rules.
Really?

326
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,001
Were you in the rules when
you kicked me in the face?

327

Isn't there something more important
you should be doing right now?

328

He hates the man.

329
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,715
That seems a bit juvenile,
wouldn't you say?

330
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,550
Go mess with him
and see what happens.

331
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:54,968
Why?
CORA: Do it.

332
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,636
Would it be funny if I
punched you in the face?

333
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,929
Would that be funny?
Stop it.

Don't you have something more important

Thank you. I love you.
Thank you, Daddy.

Love you, too.

I think I heard a

a flying telephone cratered

of communication home.</i>

951
01:13:47,841 --> 01:13:50,093
If they have lost their communication
ship, how could they do that?

952
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:51,303
<i>The same way we did.</i>

953
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:54,139
<i>Our communications station

954
01:13:54,222 --> 01:13:57,809
<i>to send a message to deep space
via the Landsat 7 satellite.</i>

955

they have domed the islands.</i>

959
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:18,496
You're saying E.T.
wants to phone home?

960
01:14:19,539 --> 01:14:21,875
That would be incredibly,
incredibly bad.

961
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:24,586
So far, only five ships
have made contact.

962
01:14:24,753 --> 01:14:27,130
If five ships can do this,
what do you think 50 can do,

963
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:30,091
or 500 or 5,000 or 500,000?

If you'll just
give me one second...

966
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:54,699
Why am I staring at a lizard?

You have 15 seconds. Go.

970
01:15:01,206 --> 01:15:03,500
Okay, sir, I put the helmet on,

971
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:05,710
and the helmet is, basically,
extreme sunglasses.

972
01:15:05,877 --> 01:15:08,505
And it's some hydration
and some oxygen saturation,

973
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:09,839
and a bunch of other stuff
I don't understand.

974
01:15:09,923 --> 01:15:12,967
But we took Penelope to the beach one
time, which was a terrible idea.

975
01:15:13,051 --> 01:15:16,012
She went absolutely crazy because
she can't handle the sunlight.

976
01:15:16,179 --> 01:15:18,306
You see? I don't think that they
can handle the sunlight either.

Negative, sir.

There's no satellite

It's our deep-space satellite.

It only orbits into range

We've got about five hours.

And then they will use it to
slingshot their transmission.

Without radar, we have no
way to track them, correct?

1016
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:25,058
Correct. But I don't think
they can see us, either.

Why?
Because we are still alive.

Okay, so they can't see us
and we can't see them.

off that big gray monster,

1419
01:58:37,695 --> 01:58:39,655
get out to Coronado and get your
hands dirty with the big boys?

1420
01:58:39,738 --> 01:58:41,115
Yes, sir.
You think you've got what it takes?

1421
01:58:41,198 --> 01:58:42,950
I hope so, sir.
Call me, Hopper.

1422
01:58:43,033 --> 01:58:44,660
It just might be too
much sleep, though, sir.

1423
01:58:44,702 --> 01:58:46,036
A little too much sleep for you?
Yes, sir.

1424
01:58:46,120 --> 01:58:47,121
We will have to see about that.

1425
01:58:47,204 --> 01:58:49,665
Come on, Hopper,
cozy up to Nagata.

1426
01:58:49,748 --> 01:58:51,083
You look so cute.

1427
01:58:51,250 --> 01:58:52,876
You guys make a great couple.
Are we dating now?

1428
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:54,378
You look dapper.

Oh!

Bad timing.

Congratulations.
Thank you.

How are you?
Good, how are you?

1435

I love you.
I love you.

I'm a pretty lucky guy,
you know that?

1437
01:59:07,057 --> 01:59:09,852
Which is why I think it's a perfect
time for you to talk to my dad.

1438
01:59:09,935 --> 01:59:12,855
Where is he?
I wish he was standing right here.

1439

That's perfect, because look!

1440
01:59:15,733 --> 01:59:18,610
Your wish came true,
honey. Go get him.

1441
01:59:21,030 --> 01:59:23,032
Thumbs up, that helps.

1446

I want you to know
that I am in love with Sam.

1447
01:59:35,711 --> 01:59:39,757
And I am asking your permission
to marry your daughter.

1448
01:59:43,427 --> 01:59:44,470
No.

1449

Thank you, sir.
I mean, it's...

What?
No.

I saved the world.

1453

Saving the world is one thing, Hopper.
My daughter is quite another.

But...
No means no, Hopper.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm late for lunch.

I think I will have
a chicken burrito.

Yes, sir.

You got nothing on Jay-Z.

I mean,
even I couldn't get Beyoncé.

1465

I couldn't get Beyoncé either.

1466

No way.
