1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,378
[Sara] Previously on
Legends of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:05,005
- How did you do that?
- How did I do that?

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,423
Remember when we dented history?

4
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,050
By building Heyworld,
we changed the future.

5
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:12,053
<i>[Nate] What you think of as a haunting
is a temporal echo.</i>

6
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,889
<i>She is the you before.., you.</i>

7
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,056
[Charlie] Sara, no.

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,266
<i>My sister...
[gasping]</i>

9
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,435
-[Atropos] You can't kill me.
- No!

10
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,436
<i>I'm a god.</i>

11
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,355
[grunts]

12
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,982
We're being hunted
by a pair of bloody gods.

13
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:26,067
<i>This situation just got
a hell of a lot more dicey.</i>

14
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,904
Behrad, he's dead.
Can that Loom bring him back?

15
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,363
If we get the last piece, yeah.

16
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:38,496
[harp playing]

17
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,833
[Charlie] Oh, there you are.

18
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:44,711
It's always the artsy types with you,
ain't it?

19
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,504
How many times must I tell you

20
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:49,549
my powers are not a tool
for your amusement, Clotho?

21
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:50,842
<i>[Nate] Wait, wait, wait.., time-out.</i>

22
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,802
But you did look different at the time,
though, right?

23
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,471
[Charlie] Shapeshifter. 'Course I did.

24
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,349
But it makes the story easier
to imagine, if you just picture me.

25
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,142
- Yeah, just pay attention.
- Yeah, yeah.

26
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,603
Anyway, then she said her magic word...

27
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,521
Enchantress.

28
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:11,321
I imagine this has something to do
with your theft of the Loom of Fate?

29
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:12,822
You disapprove?

30
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,408
No.

31
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:19,162
Humanity's status quo should be
shaken up every few millennia.

32
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,580
It's good for them.

33
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:25,502
Well, I'm glad you think so,
because this is a pretty big shake-up.

34
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,587
I need to make sure
that no one ever finds this.

35
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,590
Not even me,
and especially not Lachesis.

36
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,550
- You think you can do that?
-[Agent Sharpe] Question.

37
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:34,886
- La-who?
- Lachesis.

38
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,181
She's my older sister
and also the leader of the Fates.

39
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,267
Now, she's a real master manipulator.

40
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,394
Atropos kills because Lachesis wills it.

41
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,814
It is you, Clotho,
that has the difficult task.

42
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,691
What, running and hiding?

43
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,651
I am relieving you
of a piece of the Loom

44
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:52,112
that has been your entire reason
for existence.

45
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,489
Now, that you are free of it...

46
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,825
it will be up to you
to determine what, if anything,

47
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,743
is left of Clotho in its wake.

48
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:02,914
All I need is to make sure that
that ring is never found.

49
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:05,542
Existential actualization
can come later.

50
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,756
You cannot run forever, Clotho.

51
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,844
And that's the last thing I remember.

52
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,430
You have no idea
what spell Enchantress cast?

53
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:21,224
That would defeat the whole point
of goin' to her, now, wouldn't it?

54
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,893
Charlie, all we need is the third ring
to bring Behrad back.

55
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,062
And now, you're telling us
it's impossible to find?

56
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,149
Maybe you could have mentioned that
before your sister got on the ship.

57
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,067
See, this is exactly the kind of thing
I was afraid would happen.

58
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,027
Stop!

59
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,279
Passing blame
is not gonna help anything.

60
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,364
I'm sorry, Z.

61
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,284
This Enchantress is a witch, right?

62
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:40,535
Well, we have...

63
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,495
whatever it is you are.

64
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,789
So, do some hocus-pocus
and find the ring.

65
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,792
Yeah, well, it's not as simple
as finding Atropos' ring, love.

66
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,587
Locating something hidden by someone
as powerful as Enchantress,

67
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,213
that can take months, maybe even years.

68
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,299
I don't accept that.

69
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,217
Behrad is gone and he's not coming back

70
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,886
until you find the ring.

71
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,430
So, figure it out, magic man.

72
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,475
Fast

73
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:25,914
[knock at door]

74
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:27,999
Hey.

75
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,543
You know,

76
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,463
I'm here for you if you ever
want to talk about Behrad.

77
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,007
We're getting him back.

78
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:41,054
There's no point in dwelling on it,
because everything's going to be fine.

79
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,055
Totally.

80
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:46,101
By the way, when I went on
that totem journey thing...

81
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,479
I met the other me.

82
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:51,856
Really?

83
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,819
How.., how is she?

84
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,073
She's great. Tough, cool...

85
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,535
You must have a thing for warrior women.

86
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:08,164
Only if they're from another time period
and eventually will leave me. Sure.

87
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:09,707
[Nate clears throat]

88
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,668
Did she have a message for me?

89
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,711
No.

90
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,010
But I can tell
she really cares about you.

91
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,388
I really care about her.

92
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,224
And just so you know, I, uh...

93
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:27,934
care about you, too.

94
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,190
Oh, all right, lovebirds,
look, I think I've got something.

95
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,609
Now, it won't be pretty,
but it might just work.

96
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,902
So, come on. Chop-chop.

97
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,710
[sighs]

98
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,677
[Charlie] Sara! Are you there?

99
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,138
Hey, Sara!

100
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,223
Sara?

101
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,643
- You all right?
- Yeah. I just, um...

102
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,149
It was nothing. I'm good.

103
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:20,195
Listen, you got hit full-force
with the power of Atropos.

104
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,779
- Yeah?
- I know you survived,

105
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,281
but there still could be repercussions.

106
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:27,785
Charlie.., look, I'm telling you,
I'm completely fine. All right?

107
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,871
Assassin's honor.

108
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,247
Fine.

109
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,751
[Constantine] All right, you lot.
Listen up.

110
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,962
Lachesis' ring could be anywhere
in space and time.

111
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,632
I'm going to need to borrow a little bit
of magical energy off you lot

112
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,509
to help amplify the summoning spell.

113
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,136
- Exactly how does that work?
-[Constantine] That's easy.

114
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,554
All you need to do
is keep your mouths shut

115
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,765
and let me use your auras
like batteries.

116
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,517
- Is this safe? It doesn't sound safe.
- It isn't.

117
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,353
Any more questions? Good.
Let's hold hands.

118
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,482
[reciting invocation]

119
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,994
- Whoa. This feels weird!
-[Gary] It is weird.

120
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,121
Kinda like that time
we went mushroom picking.

121
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,457
Focus, or you'll botch the bloody spell!

122
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,251
[Constantine reciting]

123
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,688
[gasps]

124
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,190
- Sara!
-[Constantine] Focus!

[classical music playing]

128
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,427
Where is everyone?

129
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,388
[Constantine sighs]

130
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,223
Wait. Something happened.

131
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,017
Oh, bollocks.

132
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,436
When everyone lost focus,
I had successfully

133
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,604
bound the ring to the house,

134
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,064
but I was still working
to anchor it temporally.

135
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:24,152
So, you, me and the ring
have been whooshed into the past?

136
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,486
Good work.

137
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,740
It's magic, love.
It's more of an art than a science.

138
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,743
[gasps] Oh, my, are those guests?

139
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,661
I didn't hear the bell ring.

140
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,207
Well, hello! I'm Mrs. Hughes.
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

141
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,209
Oh, no bother, love.

142
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,254
This is a lovely.., boarding house.

143
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,381
You know,
I could see myself living here.

144
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,551
Now, wherever did my etui get to?

145
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,677
Is it that?

146
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:50,928
[gasps]

147
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,930
Thank you, my dear.

148
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,059
I would have found it eventually.

149
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,062
Sometimes, one just needs
to stop looking.

150
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,688
-[chuckles]
- Right, totally.

151
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,608
Oh, is that another guest already?

152
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,319
It is, indeed.

154
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,908
Were you two
going to book a room, or...

155
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,369
Right you are. Yes.
Me and my wife here--

156
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,664
Oh, we're not married. [chuckles]

157
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,166
Well, I'm afraid I'm a bit traditional.

158
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,961
I don't allow single women
to stay in my establishment.

159
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,590
But we are engaged. Yay!

160
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,885
My sincerest congratulations!

161
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,888
- Please sign here.
- Oh, yes, of course.

162
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,894
And you will be in
room number three, upstairs.

163
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,896
Supper is at 8:00, sharp.

164
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,357
All right, thank you. Mr. White.

165
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:53,241
Huh. You know, you should take note.
This place can actually look decent

166
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,951
with a bit of TLC.

167
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,786
See what a difference a nice set
of curtains can make?

168
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:00,081
Yeah, all right. Now, let's take stock
of our situation, shall we?

169
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,667
Now, I'm assuming you can wield
the totem like Behrad.

170
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,627
Mm-mm.
I'm just holding onto this for him.

171
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,962
I don't have a superpower.

172
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,756
- Unless you count having flawless brows.
- I don't.

173
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,508
Oh, and by age 15,

174
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,511
I built a social media empire
valued at over 500 million dollars.

175
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,680
The New York <i>Times</i> called me
the most influential influencer

176
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,558
-of my generation.
- Oh, The New York <i>Times,</i> eh?

177
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,435
Yeah, it's, like,
an app that tells you the news.

178
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:25,565
So, your superpower
is that you're sort of popular?

179
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:29,569
Oh, calling me "sort of" popular is like
calling da Vinci "sort of" a genius.

180
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,946
Great. Got it.

181
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,241
What about you?
What exactly do you do,

182
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,327
besides wear the same outfit everyday,
and screw up spells?

183
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,539
I've banished demons, slain dragons
and walked through the fires of Hell.

184
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,916
I'm a sneaky bastard and
the greatest sorcerer that ever lived.

185
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,668
Cool, cool, cool. Do you wanna go ahead
and "sorcer" something

186
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,420
so, we can find the ring
and get out of here?

187
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,465
- Hmm. Yeah.
- Yeah.

188
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,019
Okay. So, does that mean it's in there?

189
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,688
Yeah, it seems so.
This is the doctor's room.

190
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:09,317
Maybe you could, uh, "influence" him out
while I go check it out?

191
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,527
Mm. See? You need my skill set already.

192
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,156
Yeah, all right. Good luck.
[clears throat]

193
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,409
[Zari clears throat]

194
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,248
Can I help you?

195
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,750
[coughs]

196
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,545
I seem to have come down
with something, Doctor.

197
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,839
Might you be able to give me a checkup?

198
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,800
Of course. I'd be happy to help.

199
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,177
Please. Come in.

200
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,639
Perhaps we could go down
to the sitting room.

201
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,350
I am a newly-engaged woman, after all.

202
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,102
I understand. One moment.

203
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:47,355
[Scoffs]

204
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,567
Ah. Hmm!

205
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,867
No ring?

206
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,453
We're still looking for one.

207
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:05,122
And you arrived with no luggage,
if I'm not mistaken.

208
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,791
[Zari] Couldn't wait to get away
from the city.

209
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,626
Yes, I could see why your betrothed

210
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,712
would want to get you to himself
as quickly as possible.

211
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,340
- You have a beautiful face.
- Oh, thank you.

212
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,884
- I moisturize.
- It's not like my face.

213
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,720
No one remembers my face.

214
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:21,806
Huh.

215
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:25,101
You know, you could, uh, look into
getting a rebranding specialist.

216
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,146
I'm afraid your case is worse
than I thought.

217
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:33,276
I must insist we return to my room
for a more thorough examination.

218
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:39,073
Oh, my gosh. Look at that.
No more cough! [laughs]

219
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,410
You're a real miracle worker, Doc.

220
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,122
You should just stay here, relax,
have a drink. And I'm gonna...

221
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,124
Okay, bye-We-

222
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,172
Ew.

223
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:09,520
John?

224
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:10,980
John!

225
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:14,025
It seems we did end up
in my room, after all.

226
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,319
Shall we begin the examination?

227
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,664
[White groans]

228
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:32,543
[neck snaps]

229
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,088
John, you killed him!

230
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,758
'Course I did.
He's Jack the bloody Ripper!

231
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,469
Behind you!

232
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,015
[gasps]

233
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,016
Blimey!

234
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,935
Old leather apron here
must be an Encore.

235
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,895
Hand me some rope now, will you, love?

236
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,358
Cheers.

237
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:59,070
[Gideon] Captain Lance is experiencing
unusual activity in the striatum,

238
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,947
a region of the brain
that processes time.

239
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,408
I'm continuing to run tests
to determine the cause.

240
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:08,579
So, Atropos not only killed Behrad,
but also managed to put Sara in a coma.

241
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,081
I don't think the team's gonna survive

242
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,582
another run-in
with your sister, Charlie.

243
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,377
If we had it my way, we never would've
run into her in the first place.

244
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,879
[Gideon] Pardon me, but Dr. Heywood
and Mr. Green are requesting

245
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,089
your presence on the bridge.

246
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,967
The Prognosticator is showing
unusual Encore activity.

247
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:21,884
Hey.

248
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,553
You got this, Captain.

249
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:25,972
Right...

250
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,474
"Captain."

251
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,105
All the Encores are moving through time.

252
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,650
More specifically, they're all heading
towards a particular point.

253
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,569
- Looks like they're hunting something.
- Or someone.

254
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,405
Astra must have sent
the Encores after John.

255
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,448
Gideon, pinpoint
where and when they're converging.

256
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,659
See, guys? I knew all my time spent

257
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,369
creating the Prognosticator
would be worth it.

258
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,872
- Ava Sharpe saves the day again!
-[Gideon] I'm sorry, Captain.

259
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,916
It appears that
the Prognosticator is not equipped

260
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,918
to handle time-traveling Encores.

261
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,044
[grunts]

262
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,879
Ava, take a deep breath.

263
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,589
You know what, we don't even know
if Sara's gonna wake up.

264
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,925
And if she does, she's going to find out
that two of the Legends are missing.

265
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,427
This is beyond unacceptable.

266
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,886
Let's just sit down.

267
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,055
I'll bring you a cup
of your favorite herbal tea--

268
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,807
[grunts] I'm not just gonna sit around
and do nothing.

269
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,267
If we can't track the Encores,

270
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,602
we have to go after them
at the source... Astra.

271
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,104
I seriously doubt she's just gonna agree

272
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,273
to stop doing whatever
her current evil plan is.

273
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,401
That's why I'm not going
to give her a choice.

274
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,195
Nighty-night, Jackie-boy.

275
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,406
Sweet dreams of disembowelment
and all that jazz.

276
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,866
What the hell, John?

277
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,535
[sighs] Astra must have sent him here
after me.

278
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,829
You know, not everything is about you.

279
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,874
Well, it'd be a big, bloody coincidence
if an Encore just happened

280
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,377
to show up in the same time and place
as us for no apparent reason.

281
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,713
Okay, fine. But I thought
you and Astra had a deal.

282
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,715
Clearly, she got impatient, all right?

283
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,634
Yeah, I know the feeling.
Did you find the ring?

284
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,388
It wasn't in his room. Now something
is interfering with my magic.

285
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,807
Yeah, some great sorcerer...

286
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,726
Ooh, some great influencer.

287
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,519
You could barely keep him
distracted for ten minutes.

288
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,065
Oh, I'm sorry, should I have
let myself be serial killed,

289
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,734
so, you would've had five more minutes
to not find the ring?

290
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,987
You know what, we should split up,
so we can both find this in peace.

291
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,239
Fine by me, sweetheart.

292
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,616
[entry bell rings]

293
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:18,042
- Howdy, ma'am. My name's Clyde Barrow.
- And my name's Bonnie.

294
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,503
[Clyde] And we're in need
of some accommodations.

295
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,963
Bloody hell. They're all Encores.

296
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,845
All right. While I'm down there,

297
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,889
you two need to work on
fixing the Prognosticator,

298
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,349
so we can track down Zari and John.

299
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:34,975
Well, tech is not really--

300
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,185
Charlie!

301
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,686
Sure. We'll figure it out.

302
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,855
Um, I feel like somebody has to ask you.

303
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,983
Are you 100% certain
you want Gary to take you to Hell?

304
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,401
I was kinda wondering the same thing.

305
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,362
Look, Gary is the only wizard
I have access to.

306
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,863
And besides, I'm not only
taking Gary down there.

307
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,448
I'm gonna need some extra muscle, too.

308
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,867
Well, thank you for noticing
the extra reps

309
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,370

-[Agent Sharpe] You ready, Mick?

310

- Oh.
- Mic:k,

311
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,331
I thought you were taking
some time off to hang out with the kid.

312
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,542
She told me to go to Hell.
Where are we headed?

313
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,586
The portal to Hell is ready, Captain.
All that's left is for...

314
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,464
me to drink some of this demon blood.

315
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,258

-[Gary] Yeah.

Ugh.

317
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,558
- Oh. It's actually quite tangy.
- Okay. How do we do this?

318
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,727
I will say some words, and then
the sigil will transport us to Hell

319
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,480
for precisely four hours.

320
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,691
After that,
we'll be transported right back here.

321
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:24,984
Sounds good to me.

322

[Gary] This was a terrible idea.

About time we killed the bitch.

No! John has been working so hard
to rehabilitate her.

Also, I thought we didn't use
that word anymore.

You know what, I'm gonna let the B-word
slide this time.

She sent a bunch of criminals
after our friends.

339
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,450
How do we even find her?
What are we supposed to do,

340
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,285

Uh, it's two streets down, make a left.

Wow. I didn't expect that to work.
Thanks, Micky!

Guess we're both out of luck.

348
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,063
Why would Astra send
so many Encores after me?

349
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,523
I mean.., seems like overkill.

350
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,151
Again, maybe it's not all about you.

351

What if they're after the ring?

352

You know, I never told Astra
about the Loom of Fate,

I'm seriously suggesting that
you stay here, while I handle it.

and possess far superior social skills.

Yeah. Well, you bottled it
when Jack the Ripper attacked.

Well, I can't exactly go out there

I think I have an idea.

Clyde and I were tortured
by Manaxos the Mutilator himself.

Your pain was a mere trifle compared
to what the Norfulthing did to me.

And I thought the Hellhounds
were the worst evil a man could suffer.

Ah, and you must be Brutus.

470
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:56,351
Yeah, I'll definitely be seeing
that one again down here.

471
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,771
Oh, you're no fun.

472
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,774
Now, this is where I keep
all my soul coins.

473
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,736
And as you can see, they're all right--

474
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,656
Did you lose something?

475
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:15,829
No one with an "executive privacy"
button has good intentions.

476
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,540
My vault is empty.

477
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:22,753
Besides me, you're the only one
with access, Tiberius. Care to explain?

478
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,254
Is this one of those human pranks?

479
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,506
You had me take them out
for you last week.

480
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,883
Like hell I did.

481
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,344
I swear it, I saw you myself.

482
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,514
A shapeshifter. Damn it!

483
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,891
[grunts]

484
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,059
[gasps]

485
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:38,810
[thud]

486
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,522
Oh, don't look at me like that.
He'll be fine in a few hours.

487
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,359
Better, even, 'cause he'll have learned
to be less gullible.

488
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,569
At least
the most valuable one is still...

489
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,702
Who the hell is Vandal Savage?

490
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:58,330
- Oh, I actually know that one. He's--
- Shut up!

491
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,501
I can't believe she did this to me.

492
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,378
Wait. You know who stole your coins?

493
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,046
Yeah.

494
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:08,632
But she is...

495
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,594
too powerful for me to take on.

496
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,596
Okay. What if you had backup, you know?

497
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,264
"Enemy of my enemy" sort of thing.

498
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,350
Fine.

499
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,352
But this will require stealth.

500
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:24,147
Wakey-wakey.

501
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,817
The boys stay here.

502
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,324
Now, that was influencing.

503
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:36,326
You really think
there's a saint's chance in Hell

504
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,327
that your truce is gonna hold?

505
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,871
May I remind you
that one of them is ruddy Brutus!

506
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,915
Sorry, was that some weird
British-y way of saying

507
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,750
-"Thank you for saving my life, Zari"?
-[chuckles]

508
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,128
Yeah, okay. All right.
I was in a bit of a pickle.

509
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,672
I admit it,
but may I suggest that we use

510
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,340
the few minutes that you bought us

511
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,050
-to go and look for the ring?
- Shh.

512
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:08,984
[gun cocks]

513
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,903
Sorry about this, hon.

514
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,572
Please, don't.

515
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,282
Don't be scared.

516
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,994
"The evil that men do lives after them,"
and all that.

517
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,125
So, who's this being we're going to see?

518
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,294
The woman
who found me terrified and alone

519
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,504
when John left me to rot down here.

520
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:33,049
She took me in, raised me,
taught me how to make it in Hell.

521
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,177
Wow. And now she's betrayed you.

522
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,138
She was the one person
I thought I could trust.

523
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,056
Everything I am, I owe to her.

524
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,685
You know, I don't know if that is
some sob story or what, Astra,

525
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,228
but I know how you feel.

526
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,480
- Really?
- Yeah.

527
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,064
I think it's a pretty specific story.

528
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:51,777
Yeah, well, I had a mentor once.
The guy's name was Rip.

529
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,737
I trusted him with my life
until I found out that

530
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,032
he fabricated all my memories
to make me good at my job.

531
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,202
That's awful. So what did you do
when you found out, did you kill him?

532
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,620
Ooh. [chuckles]

533
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,205
I wanted to so bad.

534
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,333
But, you know,
the one thing that I learned is...

535
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,668
the only way to keep going
is to take control of your life.

536
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,338
Stop letting everybody act like
they know what's best for you

537
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,964
and make your own choices, you know?

538
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:14,841
What the--

539
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,468
[Agent Sharpe scoffs]

540
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,554
So, it was a sob story, after all.

541
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:23,517
No, it was the truth.
Thanks for the therapy session.

542
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,644
Don't have too much fun
without me, boys.

543
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,354
I'll be back soon.

544
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:42,160
Show me the treasure I seek!

545
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,870
[compass chimes]

546
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,208
That compass must have
some sort of Hell powers.

547
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,668
He's using it to track the ring.

548
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,629
- Okay, then we need to get the compass.
- All right. I'll grab it.

549
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,464
Hey. I'm going with you.

550
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,093
All right. Follow me.

551
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,562
[exclaims]

552
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,190
[Zari clears throat]

553
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:15,402
Hey.

554
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:23,285
[chuckles] Well, that was
bloody convenient, wasn't it?

555
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,543
I tried to fight them. Just like Rory.

556
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,962
You folded like
a cheap deck of cards, you bum.

557
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,256
[grunts] Easy.

558
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,384
It's okay, Gary.
I totally got played by Astra.

559
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:44,264
On the bright side,
there's not much time left on the sigil.

560
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,224
We'll pop back
to the Waverider soon enough.

561
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:50,186
Um, about that...
I'm the one who cast the spell.

562
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,856
So, I'll pop back to the Waverider,
along with anyone who's touching me

563
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,399
when the time runs out.

564
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:55,901
I'm sorry.

565
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,195
- Didn't I mention that?
-[both] No!

566
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,865
Listen, you dweeb.
I gotta get out of here. I got a thing.

567
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,158
What thing?

568
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,202
Lita has a soccer match.

569
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,788
She didn't invite me,
but I'm inviting myself.

570
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:09,873
Sorry, ROW-

571
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,542
And I refuse to die here
without getting to know my daughter.

572
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,086
Do we understand each other?

573
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,131
- What position does she play?
- Gary.

574
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,387
[sighs] Hold on,
we were here just a minute ago.

575
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,222
John, we are going in circles.

576
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,975
Yeah, it seems like it's not just
my magic that's wonky in this place.

577
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:31,519
Magic or no, there's so many people
looking for this ring,

578
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,021
it should've turned up by now.

579
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,607
It's like [sighs]
it doesn't want to be found.

580
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,861
Hold on a minute,
you might be onto something.

581
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,698
"Sometimes you just have
to stop looking," right?

582
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,950
Why would we stop looking?

583
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,576
Because I'm beginning to suspect

584
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,454
that the spell on the ring
is of a particular breed.

585
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,665
So, if you want to find the ring...

586
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,500
you can't find it.

587
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,169
[chuckles]

588
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:59,589
You've gotta hand it to Enchantress,
she is a crafty one.

589
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:03,176
Okay, it's not just gonna
slip our minds. So, what do we do?

590
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,013
We drink.

591
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,400
I know what you did, Lachesis.

592
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,740
- Who's she?
- Astra, my dear,

593
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,159
I'd like you to meet my sister, Atropos.

594
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:31,246
I've wanted you two to meet
for quite some time now.

595
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,123
Your sister?

596
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:36,418
We've worn many faces in our long lives,

597
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,128
but we are family.

598
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,672
Anything you need to say to me,
you can say in front of her.

599
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,591
I know you stole my soul coins.

600
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:47,512
Of course I did. I had to.

601
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,223
Astra, they were becoming a distraction.

602
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:53,685
You'd amassed all this power
for what? Parties?

603
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:55,729
Gambling?

604
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:59,733
- You need to think in grander terms.
- Much grander.

605
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,737
You see, Astra, my sister and I...

606
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,823
are two of the three Fates.

607
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,909
The Loom of Fate belongs to us.

608
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,494
It is our birthright.

609
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:16,166
- Why.., why didn't you tell me?
-[laughs] You weren't ready.

610
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:20,003
Oh, Astra, making soul coins

611
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:23,715
and using them to control
the denizens of Hell

612
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,718
was a cheap reflection
of my former glory.

613
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:30,847
Now, that the Loom of Fate
is within reach...

614
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,350
I want you to become one of us.

615
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,478
Become our third sister.

616
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,856
You'd have the power of a god.

617
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:43,568
Astra, this is what
I have been preparing you for

618
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,528
ever since I took you in
as a young girl.

619
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,406
But what about my mom?

620
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,950
John had promised that
he'd use the Loom of Fate

621
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,368
to make it so she never died.

622
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:57,624
Astra, you need to move beyond
these petty human desires!

623
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:02,796
I am offering you the power
to design destiny.

624
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,924
You once sought to rule over Hell...

625
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,511
Now, you can rule over the whole cosmos.

626
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,055
Will you join us?

627
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,183
What do you say, girl?

628
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,644
Trust me, Astra.
I know what's best for you.

629
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,020
Sister always knows best.

630
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,775
Of course, I'll join you.

631
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,903
How could I ever turn down
so much power?

632
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,321
Good girl.

633
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,448
There's just one thing.

634
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,868
John Constantine's coin.

635
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,453
He's mine to toy with.

636
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,331
Seems like a fair trade.

638

[Bonnie] I took care of Brutus.

639
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,903
And I got our pirate friend, Caesar.

640
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:10,697
Any luck with the ring?

641
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,490
Damn thing might as well be invisible.

642
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:15,618
Well, Bonnie, guess we got no choice
but to make the rest

643
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,662
-of our fellow guests disappear.

645
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,840
Now, what do we have here?

646
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,550
Another Hell-ian to kill?

647
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,135
Lucky us.

648
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,513
- I'm Jack the Ripper.
- Nice try.

649
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:36,806
We already met Jack.

650
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,100
That Jack's an imposter. Worse...

651
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,353
- It's John Constantine.
- That liar!

652
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,022
He must be here to send us back to Hell.

653
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,024
Now, don't lose your temper, Bonnie.

654
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,318
We'll teach that grifter a lesson, okay?

655
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,864
[sighs deeply]

656
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,782
Good old Mrs. Hughes.

657
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,368
Okay, I'm not thinking about the ring.

658
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,370
I'm not thinking about the ring.

659
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,080
Yeah, that's not gonna work.

660
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,750
So, you're just gonna accept failure
when we are this close?

661
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:04,959
I'm not giving up.

662
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,378
Oh, I don't see it as giving up,
so much as...

663
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,131
accepting reality.

664
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,591
I know myself.

665
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:16,179
I'm a ripe old mix of guilt and torment.

666
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:19,182
If the Loom of Fate offers me
even one glimmer of hope

667
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,726
of redemption for all my past sins,

668
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,479
particularly Astra, then...

669
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,857
I'll never not be thinking about it.

670
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,237
You know, it's funny,
I'm usually an expert

671
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,530
at getting things out of my head.

672
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:40,745
Boyfriend cheating on me
with my assistant/best friend?

673
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:44,415
No time to cry,
I have a fall fashion line to plan.

674
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,419
Overhearing my mother tell a friend
she's embarrassed

675
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,047
her daughter is so shallow
and self-absorbed?

676
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:55,677
Definitely can't process that,
I will check my Cat-Chat analytics.

677
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:05,478
But my baby brother dying
because he was trying to protect me?

678
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,942
There is nothing that can get that
out of my head.

679
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,659
I was wearing the totem when he died.

680
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,247
If I hadn't been, maybe he...

681
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,876
Maybe he would have had a chance.

682
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,379
[sniffs]

00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,259
Look, you can take it from an expert...

[sighs]

Nothing good ever comes
from beating yourself up, love.

686
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,852
Don't try to make me feel better.

687
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,441
John.

688
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,777
What if we don't find the ring?

689
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,446
What if I never get him back?

690
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,073
[Clyde] Yoo-hoo!

691
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:02,869
- John friggin' Constantine!
- We know who you are,

692
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,747
and there's someone here
you'll be just dying to meet.

693
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,000
They do say imitation
is the sincerest form of flattery.

[breathes heavily]

695
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,508
This passage leads outside.
I'll distract them while you escape.

696
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,844
- No, come with me.
- Go.

697
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:23,181
This is my house
and I'm just crazy enough to defend it.

698
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,766
And listen...

699
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,476
you can get Behrad back, Zari.

700
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,770
I truly believe that. But unless
you get out of here right now,

701
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,646
then neither of you stand a chance.

702
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:33,900
Okay.

703

[sighs]

704
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:58,216
Ava, I'd just like to say,
you're the best boss I've ever had.

705
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,551
Well, the only boss I've ever had.

706
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:03,721
I'm more apprentice
than employee with John.

707
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,098
And before the Bureau, well--

708
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,142
Ah! Finally, you've come to kill us.

709
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,937
About time. I was getting bored!

710
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,981
[groans]

711
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,068
[Astra] Get out of here.

712
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,946
Astra, what made you change your mind?

713
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,572
You're helping John
find the Loom for me.

714
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,907
Might as well let you.

715
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,493
Either he'll come through,
or Lachesis is bound to.

716
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,787
Did you say "Lachesis"? The Fate?

717
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,831
Wait, how do you know who--

718
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,499
It's a small underworld after all.

719
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,334
- Time's almost up!
- Come with us.

720
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:34,836
- What?
- What?

721
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,629
[Agent Sharpe] Astra, it's time
for you to take control.

722
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:37,672
Don't wait for them.

723
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,966
You can help us find the Loom
and save your mother yourself.

724
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,134
Ten seconds left!

725
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,386
The choice is yours.

726
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,142
Wait, did she ever channel an animal
while you were, you know...

727
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,601
She did once.

728
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:51,686
But it was...

729
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,984
- Is that...
- Meet Astra.

730
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,527
Why does she have the sword?

731
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,112
There's no time to explain.
We got to move.

732
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:06,909
Where's the ring, John?

733
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,661
I don't know where the ring is.

734
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:11,289
And even if I did,
I wouldn't tell you muppets.

735
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,749
John. John, be reasonable.

736
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,793
We are going to kill you, regardless.

737
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,838
But it's up to you
how painful that death has to be.

you can stay alive without...

740
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,427
certain organs.

741
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,016
- You want your coat back, don't ya?
- Mm.

742
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,934
You can all go to Hell!

743
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,228
Hmm.

744
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:38,733
Stop!

Yes.

00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,406
I order you to stop.

748
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,158
You don't have
that kind of power here, honey.

749
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,202
Are you both serious? She's with him!

750
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,745
Is that so?

751
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,371
Maybe this will make you talk.

752
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,248
I don't know
where the ring is, all right?

753
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,877
Funny, I believe you. What a shame.

754
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,797
- Cheer up, darlin'. We can kill him now.
- Mmm.

00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,840
See you around, John Constantine.

788
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,512
So, you got the totem to work?

789
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,431
Yeah, I did. It was amazing.

790
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,308
Terrifying, but amazing.

791
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,228
And I sort of felt like
Behrad was there with me.

792
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:25,066
He'd be so proud of you.
I'm so proud of you. Congratulations.

793
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,360
[Gary] John!

794
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,569
You're safe!

795
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:31,697
All right, Gary. Oh! Okay, all right.
Calm down, all right?

796
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:33,324
I'm happy to see you, too, mate.

797
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,617
Hey, how's Sara doing?

798
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,828
Oh, she's still unconscious.
Charlie is sitting with her now.

799
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,956
I'm gonna try to distract myself
by fixing the Prognosticator.

800
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,667
Technical skills aren't
Charlie and I's strong suit.

801
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,294
- I know.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a tick.

802
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:48,005
If that contraption is broke,
how the hell did you find us?

803
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,840
Uh, about that...

804
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,467
Hey, John.

805
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,681
I hear we have a Loom to build.

806
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,648
