We kill him, and all the gangs

He took Sofia. Gave me this.

Damn it. I had a deal with Penguin.

Sofia Falcone was there.

AII right, we have

- Put out a citywide BOLO.

- L'll find Sofia.
- HARPER: What about the Pyg?

55
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,590
- I heard he escaped from Arkham.
- Tracked him to a black market surgeon.

56
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,593
He's already got a new

Why are you here, Father?

What did I tell you when you
asked to return to Gotham?

67
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,872
- I know...
- (LOUDLY) What did I tell you?

68

- That I wasn't ready.
- Exactly.

69
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,271
And you came back anyway.

70
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,796
Perhaps I should've acted then.
But I was indulgent.

71
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,760
Curious.
Who is this daughter I raised?

72
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,518
Father, Penguin is weak.

73

If you help me, <i>we</i> can end this.

74
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,357
I don't want Gotham.

I don't believe that.
You love this city.

I used to, yes.

77
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,915
But I'm dying, Sofia.

78
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,189
Someone else can have Gotham.
What I care about now is my family.

79

I deserve this. Gotham belongs to me.

helped reclaim Gotham.

the meaning of honor.

Thanks.

Don't thank me. Killing you
would have been a kindness.

You have no idea what you've brought
to your city.

That's a comfort.

GORDON: But I saw you shot.

476
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,353
There was another shooter there.

to throw off suspicion.</i>

to get herself</i>

plugged by a bunch
of yahoos in a car.

480
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,957
It was some pretty shooting,
if I do say so.

481
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,916
I missed all her vital parts.

482
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,952
I'm putting you in jail.
And this time it's Blackgate.

483
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,316
- You are gonna rot in there.

My father had his moment of truth.
This is yours.

489
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,996
How many cops died under
the Pax Penguina? Not one.

490
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,837
It was you who couldn't stomach it.

491
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,030
It was you who came
to the Falcones for help.

492
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,514
There is a direct line
from your decision

493
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,638
to a dozen police officers
who have been brutally murdered.

494
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,520
You are insane.

495
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,520
Why notjust kill me?

496
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,200
Because, Jim...

497
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,231
I need you at the head of the GCPD.

498
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,831
- I need...
- Someone you can control.

499
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,069
You've been planning this
since the day we first met.

500
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,110
This isn't about Gotham.
This is revenge.

501
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,554
For me killing Mario.

You want
to arrest me, arrest me.

504
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,589
But I will talk.

505
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,115
And the cops that died,
the friend that you betrayed,

506
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,838
will all have been for nothing.

507
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,792
The GCPD will crumble.

508
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,599
Penguin, or someone worse,

509
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,469
will take over
and you will lose Gotham forever.

510
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,795
Or, take on the sin as your own.

511
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,993
Keep the GCPD.
Let them think you're a hero.

512
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,632
But live knowing who you are.
What you've done.

513
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,118
That's my revenge.

Oh, thank Christ. You're safe.

Master Bruce, listen,
I don't want to fight anymore.

523

You win.

524
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,638
If this is how you want to deal

525
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,496
with what you've been going through,
then so be it.

I'm not gonna try and stop you.

528
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,999
You will remember who you are,

and when you do,
Iwill be right here...

No. you won't be.

531
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,635
I went to my lawyer and had him
draw up emancipation papers.

532
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,639
You're no longer my legal guardian.

533
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,760
I won't sign them.

534
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,636
You don't have to. Now I'm going out.

- Alfred, you're fired.
