1
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,777
Mommy…

2
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,161
Your home isn't over there, is it?

3
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:02,997
No.

4
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,792
I think they're burning Hyosan down.

5
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,544
Hey, Seoul University.

6
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,878
Yes?

7
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,172
To save the majority,

8
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,510
just how heartless are you allowed to be?

9
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,975
You must learn things like that
at your school.

10
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,357
We don't learn
that kind of stuff in my major.

11
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,901
I'm not sure what major does.

12
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,243
Oh no…

13
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,835
Stay still.

14
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,529
Let's go.

15
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,579
Let's go, On-jo.

16
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,964
I can't just go like this.

17
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,885
I'm sorry. Can you wait a bit?

18
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,222
Oh, never mind.

19
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,724
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

20
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,446
I'll go with her.

21
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,948
Let's go together.

22
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,366
I'll go too.

23
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,702
No, you hurt your leg.

24
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,246
Wu-jin, look after Dae-su.

25
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,464
Cheong-san.

26
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,638
Cheong-san!

27
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,776
Cheong-san, you jerk!

28
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,251
Let's go.

29
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,923
I don't smell anything.
There's no one here.

30
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,012
Let's say bye to Cheong-san…

31
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,767
and leave.

32
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,006
Slowly.

33
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,134
Damn it.

34
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,020
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

35
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,524
THIS IS A SAFE ZONE

36
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,410
One infected eliminated.

37
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,120
Pulling out.

38
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,168
THIS IS A RESTRICTED AREA

39
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,547
THIS IS A SAFE ZONE

40
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,345
The soldiers saw us at school.

41
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,141
They left us there without helping us.
Then they bombed it.

42
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,395
Maybe they want us to die.

43
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,523
That can't be it.

44
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,737
I think it's because of me.

45
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,075
Because we were with zombies,

46
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:18,080
they must think we're neither
zombies nor humans, like me.

47
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,543
Maybe that's what they thought.

48
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,295
Don't say that.

49
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,675
Is it okay for me
to stay with you guys like this?

50
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,470
You're still our friend
and our classroom president.

51
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,848
We couldn't have made it
this far without you.

52
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,475
Still…

53
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,019
You haven't turned,

54
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,605
and you never will.

55
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,075
Let's do that again later.

56
00:08:56,619 --> 00:09:00,164
It was my first time
sitting around a fire with friends.

57
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,544
We'll be able to do that again, right?

58
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,171
Let's do it tonight.

59
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,717
What the hell?

60
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,969
What's wrong?

61
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,805
Shit. I think we're lost.

62
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,975
-There's no trail?
-There hasn't been a trail for a while.

63
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,394
I feel like we're going in circles.

64
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,563
Why did you come this way
if there was no trail?

65
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,273
We might end up back at Hyosan.

66
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,986
Ha-ri.

67
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:30,987
Look.

68
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,992
There's something there.

69
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,342
It was tied here.

70
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,053
Who did something so nice?

71
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,055
Maybe a ginseng digger?

72
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,808
What's that?

73
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,440
I see another one.

74
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,810
RESCUE TEAM 1 NAM SO-JU

75
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,833
What state are they in?

76
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,502
It looks like
they're about to die of starvation.

77
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,838
Transport them carefully.

78
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,632
You must not lose or damage them.

79
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,092
Yes, sir.

80
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,947
Didn't he say we should go to Yangdong?

81
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,867
Do you think the zombies are here too?

82
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,618
No way.

83
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:28,706
They probably evacuated the city
because it's next to Hyosan.

84
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:32,418
Hey, I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

85
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,836
Why are there no people?

86
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,507
It's okay here.

87
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,967
Why? What's okay?

88
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,013
There are no broken windows,
and there's no blood on the streets.

89
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,351
It wouldn't be this clean
if the zombies had been rampant.

90
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:53,898
What is it?

91
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,858
Hold on.

92
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,128
What is it, Nam-ra?

93
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,009
What is it? Is something here?

94
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,677
Zombies.

95
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,349
Where?

96
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:31,727
Everywhere.

97
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,729
Are there a lot of them?

98
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,981
One, two, three…

99
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,319
four, five, six…

100
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,157
seven, eight…

101
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,578
nine, ten, eleven…

102
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,545
Run.

103
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,298
Hey, this way.

104
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,408
Damn it.

105
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,290
-Are you okay?
-Take Dae-su and go.

106
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,374
Forget it.

107
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,878
What are you doing? I said go.

108
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,254
I said forget it.

109
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,427
On-jo.

110
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,140
Fuck.

111
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,726
I have a feeling it'll all end here.

112
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,687
Stay behind me.

113
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,815
Stop messing around. Stay back.

114
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,087
Let go of me!

115
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,988
Ha-ri!

116
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,786
Fuck!

117
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:26,920
Fuck!

118
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,338
Get off of him!

119
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,007
Get off! Hey!

120
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,229
Wu-jin.

121
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,315
-Fuck.
-Wu-jin.

122
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,818
-Oh no.
-I fucking knew this would happen.

123
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,488
It's okay.

124
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,783
I knew it.

125
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,994
-Wu-jin, look at me.
-Ha-ri.

126
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,371
Did you really make the national team?

127
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,041
Yes, I did.

128
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,375
Bullshit.

129
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,253
You came to school
because you got eliminated.

130
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,423
Otherwise, you'd be at the tournament.

131
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,717
If you got eliminated,

132
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,678
you should've gone home.
Why did you come to school? Fuck.

133
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,515
-I'm sorry.
-Listen.

134
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,393
Stick with archery. Okay?

135
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,437
Okay.

136
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,688
Don't give up.

137
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,359
-Okay?
-Okay.

138
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,322
Wu-jin, I'm sorry.

139
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,577
No. Not Wu-jin.

140
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,913
Don't do it.

141
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,748
Fuck.

142
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,729
I'm sorry.

143
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,499
Su-hyeok.

144
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,751
Wu-jin…

145
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,588
Wu-jin…

146
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,975
More are coming.
Let's go that way. There aren't any there.

147
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,188
Let's go, Dae-su.

148
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,699
Ha-ri, let's go.

149
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,034
Let go.

150
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,546
Don't die a meaningless death.

151
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,154
If we run now, we can all live.

152
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,823
We have enough time.

153
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,535
I've been killing zombies, too,

154
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:50,540
but a human being would apologize
for killing her brother in front of her.

155
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,578
Eat them.

156
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,500
Eat them. Eat them all.

157
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,549
Why not? You're hungry.

158
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,595
Kill them.

159
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,229
I'm hungry.

160
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,114
Stop it.

161
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:46,907
Wait.

162
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,158
What is it?

163
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,327
Nam-ra's gone.

164
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,455
I'll be right back.

165
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,165
-Su-hyeok!
-Hey, Su-hyeok.

166
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,835
-Can you go on your own?
-What do you plan to do?

167
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,004
-Go ahead. I'll catch up.
-On-jo.

168
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,172
Hey, On-jo!

169
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,502
Nam-ra.

170
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,557
Why are you here by yourself?

171
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,226
Let's go.

172
00:23:58,478 --> 00:23:59,479
Stay away.

173
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,273
Come with us.

174
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,860
-Okay?
-I said stay away!

175
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:19,624
Nam-ra!

176
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:24,671
Nam-ra. It's me, On-jo.

177
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,006
Nam-ra, don't do this.

178
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,716
Choi Nam-ra!

179
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,015
Nam-ra, please.

180
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:57,996
You can bite me.

181
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,167
I'm okay.

182
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,669
It's okay, Nam-ra.

183
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,557
On-jo.

184
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,559
Are you okay, On-jo?

185
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,102
Are you okay?

186
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,814
Nam-ra.

187
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,026
Nam-ra.

188
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,363
Hey, Prez!

189
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,547
Nam-ra!

190
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,424
Nam-ra!

191
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,221
Hey, Choi Nam-ra!

192
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,349
Nam-ra!

193
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,161
Up ahead!

194
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,298
Survivors confirmed.

195
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,602
Go! Hurry!

196
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,315
Let's go! Let's go home!

197
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,443
Go!

198
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,070
Go!

199
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,073
Ha-ri!

200
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:03,705
Hey!

201
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,499
Come get me. All of you.

202
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,754
Today, I am…

203
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,342
the happiest guy in this school!

204
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,369
On-jo.

205
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,121
U-sin.

206
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,584
Are you okay? You're not hurt?

207
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:53,672
What about your dad?

208
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,218
Did you meet your dad?
He went to find you.

209
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,856
RESCUE TEAM 1 NAM SO-JU

210
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,031
I already knew the sorrow

211
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:22,742
of a survivor.

212
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:29,249
But I didn't know how heavy
that sorrow would be…

213
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,002
at that time.

214
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,589
Do you know the teacher, Lee Byeong-chan?

215
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,635
I only took morning classes
because I had training.

216
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:42,971
So, no, I don't.

217
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,766
Has he ever said anything weird
or acted strangely?

218
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,520
That isn't important right now.

219
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,398
I'm a senior. What about the CSAT?

220
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,068
If there's anything you want to say,
say it.

221
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:04,826
How many times do I have to tell you?

222
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:10,498
He kidnapped a student
from our class named Hyeon-ju.

223
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,334
I heard he gave Kim Hyeon-ju
some sort of injection.

224
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,544
Why did you

225
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,297
abandon us?

226
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,178
You abandoned us.

227
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,680
-If you cooperate--
-No.

228
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,682
I won't ask adults for anything

229
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,019
ever again.

230
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,064
So…

231
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,360
don't ask for my cooperation.

232
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:46,034
This notice goes out
to all citizens of Hyosan.

233
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,871
For the safety of everyone in the camp…

234
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,498
HOW MUCH TIME MUST PASS FOR THIS TO END?

235
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,333
I MISS YOU, PLEASE JUST SHOW UP

236
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,584
I MISS YOU

237
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,544
I MISS YOU, PARK JU-YEONG

238
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,593
I LOVE YOU, U-GI

239
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:09,432
FLOWING WATER ENVELOPS ME
AND FLOWS INTO MY PAINFUL MEMORIES

240
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,767
I'LL LET YOU GO NOW

241
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,534
The National Assembly hearing
on the bombing of Hyosan

242
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,119
has been postponed indefinitely
upon agreement.

243
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:33,206
The party leaders announced
in a joint statement today

244
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,875
they won't hold the hearing
until the epidemic situation…

245
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,461
They won't hold the hearing
until the epidemic situation

246
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,879
has been completely resolved.

247
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,172
The National Security Council

248
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,342
announced they will end martial law
in Hyosan today.

249
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:47,053
This comes 3 months
and 17 days since martial law

250
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,013
was imposed due to the outbreak.

251
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,390
However, as a precaution,

252
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:53,226
Hyosan residents will continue
to be quarantined.

253
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:56,813
Although it has been more than four months
since the outbreak started,

254
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:59,148
the Korea Disease Control
and Prevention Agency

255
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,817
has failed to identify the virus.

256
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,611
Since it is impossible
to know its incubation period,

257
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:07,240
the agency opposed ending
the quarantine of Hyosan residents.

258
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:10,326
Donations are pouring in
from across the nation

259
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,830
for the Hyosan residents who have been
living in quarantine for four months.

260
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,720
Thank you for your hard work.

261
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:38,646
This notice is to remind you
of the curfew times.

262
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:45,028
Curfew lasts from midnight
to 6:00 a.m. the next morning.

263
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:50,241
During this time,
please remain in your shelters

264
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:54,454
and refrain from moving
for the livelihood of all.

265
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,708
This time will be used

266
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:04,213
to inspect facilities
and to clean and disinfect the camp.

267
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:09,427
These measures are meant
to protect you from infection

268
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:14,557
and to ensure that public facilities
remain clean for everyone to use.

269
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,005
I-SAK, I MISS YOU

270
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:49,425
NAM-RA, COME BACK

271
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:53,471
CHEONG-SAN, I LOVE YOU

272
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,670
LEE CHEONG-SAN

273
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,380
Cheong-san.

274
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,915
ZOMBIE VICTIM SPECIAL ADMISSION

275
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,251
HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS WHO SUFFERED
THE ZOMBIE ATTACK

276
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,420
MUST BE GIVEN SPECIAL ADMISSIONS
INTO COLLEGES

277
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:11,591
Goodness. My daughter is a senior too.
You poor thing.

278
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:12,800
Rock, paper, scissors.

279
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,429
-Shit.
-Hang in there. You'll get another chance.

280
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,939
KOREAN RED CROSS
EMERGENCY RELIEF SUPPLIES

281
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,299
Su-hyeok.

282
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,101
Where have you been?

283
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:04,936
I couldn't find you.

284
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,772
I saw the others a few times.

285
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,234
I wanted to see them,

286
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,278
but I couldn't bring myself to.

287
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,781
In case it would remind me.

288
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,534
Can you forget if you don't see them?

289
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,746
I went to the mountain last night
and saw a campfire.

290
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,667
I think someone lit a fire
on the school rooftop.

291
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,504
The rooftop?

292
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,089
Are you sure?

293
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,718
I may be mistaken, but I'm pretty sure.

294
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,890
Nam-ra said we should light a campfire

295
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,601
if we ever meet again.

296
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,823
I plan to go tonight.

297
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,366
I'll go with you.

298
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,124
I'm sorry about that day.

299
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:11,377
About what?

300
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,714
That day when Nam-ra tried to bite you.

301
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,091
Sorry I couldn't do anything.

302
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,551
It's okay.

303
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,306
Your choice saved us all.

304
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,350
Don't tell the others.

305
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,478
It could be dangerous,
so let's go by ourselves.

306
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,764
I told you not to tell them.

307
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:12,146
Hey, I told you not to tell anyone else.

308
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:16,943
Ha-ri.

309
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,694
I said it was between us.

310
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,282
She said she'd tell the cops
if we didn't take her.

311
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,994
Fuck it.
They won't give me special admission.

312
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:31,540
How is that related to this?
They'll lock us up if we get caught.

313
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,960
I'd rather go to jail
if I can't get into college.

314
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:37,296
Let's go.
Just climb over that wall, right?

315
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,132
You're really going?

316
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:41,592
All of you?

317
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,637
You're not the only one
who feels indebted.

318
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,180
We're all hurting just like you.

319
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,307
Being alone doesn't make it hurt less.

320
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:54,563
Go on.

321
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,149
Didn't you say there was a rope?

322
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,734
-How do we get up there?
-Move.

323
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,028
-What are you doing?
-Are you sure?

324
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,322
I'm going too.

325
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,657
-Get on the ground.
-What?

326
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,033
-Let's go.
-You heard me.

327
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,387
I MISS YOU ALL

328
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,065
What is that?

329
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,026
Well,

330
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,278
I couldn't throw that away.

331
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:45,823
Joon-yeong.

332
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,993
I'll buy you a box next time.

333
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,043
I see a light.

334
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,839
-Do you see it?
-Where?

335
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,382
There.

336
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,719
Hey, I think that really is our school.

337
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,062
It's a total wreck.

338
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:19,648
I know.

339
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,049
Let's go.

340
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,015
Okay.

341
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:10,116
THIS IS A SAFE ZONE
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

342
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,906
Do you think it's really Nam-ra?

343
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:53,742
Yes.

344
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,495
I don't know why,

345
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,206
but I think it's her.

346
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,303
Who do you think it was?

347
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:03,270
Maybe… it was kids
who came back to the school like us.

348
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:09,902
Maybe it was a YouTuber or something.

349
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,487
Kids who like haunted houses.

350
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:17,743
No.

351
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,121
It was Nam-ra.

352
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:25,251
She probably lit it because she misses us.

353
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,002
How do you know that?

354
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:31,924
I don't.

355
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,093
But I think I do.

356
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:38,889
You made it.

357
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:41,892
Hey.

358
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:43,644
Prez.

359
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,564
Nam-ra.

360
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,002
Prez.

361
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,880
Am I still the classroom president?

362
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,262
I like that.

363
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:21,807
Are you okay?

364
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,310
How have you been?

365
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,410
I've missed you.

366
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,373
All of you.

367
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,252
Nam-ra.

368
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,673
I wanted to see you,
but I didn't think I should.

369
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,008
No, it's okay.

370
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,511
Let's go. Come with us.

371
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,140
I still have things to do here.

372
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,476
What things?

373
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,730
There are a few more like me.

374
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:14,151
Some fled outside of the school,
but there are still a few left.

375
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,071
You're not a zombie.

376
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:19,907
Don't say that.

377
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:24,912
You know how students are not children
but not yet adults either?

378
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,164
I'm like that.

379
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,208
I'm neither a human…

380
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:32,753
nor a monster.

381
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:34,421
That's not true.

382
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,258
Stay with us.

383
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:41,720
It's okay if it's just us.

384
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,736
We're friends even if we're not together.

385
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,406
Right?

386
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:06,745
No?

387
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,373
Yes, you're right.

388
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:13,085
Wherever we may be, we're friends.

389
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,046
That's good enough.

390
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:22,511
They're back.

391
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:29,935
I'll be back.

392
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:04,186
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, INSTITUTIONS,

393
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:07,230
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.

394
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:12,319
