1
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,090
You little brats, get lost!

2
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,090
Hey!

3
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,130
It should have been me!

4
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:01,510
I should be the one going to that Jap's house.

5
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,850
You'll miss the train.

6
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,180
Hurry.

7
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:20,130
PART ONE

8
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,320
KOUZUKI NORIAKI

9
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,520
Go back to sleep.

10
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,780
We're still far from the house.

11
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,360
Pleased to meet you. I am Okju.

12
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,280
This property has three buildings.

13
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,580
A Western-style wing designed by an English architect...

14
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,030
...and a Japanese wing form the main house.

15
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,040
Not even in Japan is there a building combining the two styles.

16
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:59,000
It reflects Master's admiration for Japan and England.

17
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,170
Next is the annex

18
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,720
which Master had furnished as a library.

19
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,840
Last, the servants' quarters.

20
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,260
As the Lady's handmaiden, you won't sleep there.

21
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,310
You may eat her leftover food,

22
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,770
but tea leaves go to the kitchen girls.

23
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,060
Used soap and oil are for the steward.

24
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,070
Anyone caught stealing is expelled that day.

25
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,440
I'm sure you wouldn't dare, Tamako.

26
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,620
"Tamako" is you, by the way.
It's your name Okju in Japanese.

27
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,660
Everything in this household is Japanese style.

28
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,000
Use only Japanese to Master and the Lady.

29
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,670
- Call me Sasaki.
- Yes, ma'am.

30
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,760
I don't trust new handmaidens.

31
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,760
Even though they greet you politely,

32
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,010
they are always the first to take scrolls
and run away when there's a fire.

33
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:02,230
The Lady's routine is simple.
She takes walks or reads for Master.

34
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,400
Among the richest men, Master is the greatest book lover.

35
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,660
And among book lovers, he is the richest.

36
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,700
His ties to the colonial government even let us use electricity.

37
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,370
In such a home,

38
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,290
you should know what's expected of a maid like you.

39
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,880
Don't be alarmed at the blackouts.

40
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,700
I sleep in here?

41
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,250
Miss Hideko wakes easily on account of her nerves.

42
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,790
- She's behind this door?
- Sh!

43
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,890
Mother!

44
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,570
Mother!

45
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,650
Mother!

46
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,490
Miss!

47
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,950
Miss, are you alright?

48
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,200
Junko! Is that you?

49
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:21,540
Junko was kicked out, Miss.
I'm the new girl.

50
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,040
You must have had a bad dream.

51
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,710
You see that big cherry tree?

52
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,010
My aunt went mad and hanged herself there.

53
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,510
Sometimes on moonless nights,

54
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,390
my aunt's ghost

55
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,810
dangles from that branch.

56
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,360
Here, drink up.

57
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,410
When babies cry, my auntie feeds them a spoonful of sake.

58
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,050
Sweet bird, sweet bird

59
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,090
My sweet bluebird

60
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:27,060
What scent is this, that fills my nose?

61
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,260
Those fuckers.

62
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,760
This is Tamako.

63
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,730
I am at your service, Miss.

64
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:21,120
A reference letter from Lady Minami, my last mistress.

65
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,910
So is this place to your liking?

66
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,170
The sun scarcely ever shines here.

67
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,090
Uncle won't permit it.

68
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,680
Sunlight causes books to fade.

69
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,300
One could never grow fond of such a dreary place.

70
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,020
Not a good liar, are you?

71
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,980
We look alike.

72
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,570
Don't you think?

73
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,610
I'll take my leave.

74
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,740
My late aunt

75
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,700
and Mrs. Sasaki

76
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,960
tried very hard to teach me of a mother's love.

77
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,000
But not really.

78
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,970
My head aches before every reading practice.

79
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,520
Would you read it to me?

80
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,730
Pardon?

81
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,990
Oh, how kind of her.

82
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,870
Lady Minami said such nice things about me!

83
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:49,790
Is that so?

84
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,210
You're a Japanese lady, why don't you speak Japanese?

85
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,880
I'm sick of it.

86
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,470
The books he makes me read are all Japanese.

87
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,100
So read that for me.

88
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,150
"Dear Miss Izumi Hideko,

89
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,570
Count Fujiwara said you're looking for a maid.

90
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,700
Maids are like...

91
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,750
a spoon... no...

92
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,370
are like chopsticks..."

93
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,010
Is it a spoon?

94
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,270
I don't know how to read, Miss.

95
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,520
Not at all? What about Korean?

96
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,130
This is your name. Can't you read it?

97
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,890
Reading can be learned,

98
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,310
and I don't care if you curse or steal.

99
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,530
But don't ever lie to me. Understood?

100
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,660
Yes, Miss.

101
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,660
She's my mother.

102
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,840
She's beautiful, quite the charmer!

103
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,380
And me? Am I "quite the charmer"?

104
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,760
Everyone says I can't compare to my mother.

105
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,310
Count Fujiwara said...

106
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,900
So you've met the Count?

107
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,270
Pardon?

108
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,020
No, I've never met him...

109
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,780
My aunt! I heard it from my aunt.

110
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,150
She was his nanny.

111
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,870
What did the Count say about me?

112
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,410
He said your face...

113
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:40,130
Every night in bed he thinks of your assets... your face.

114
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,340
Why in bed, I wonder?

115
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,840
What's with your foot?

116
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,230
I've nowhere to go.

117
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:03,360
I've just stayed in this house since coming to Korea when I was 5.

118
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,490
But in new shoes, even paths I always take seem different.

119
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,620
The ones from here

120
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,490
up to here should fit you.

121
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,120
Why don't you pick something prettier?
Like this one.

122
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,090
It's time for reading practice.

123
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,170
- I'll go alone.
- Miss?

124
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,970
But it's raining.

125
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:51,030
At noon, come knock on the door. Okay?

126
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,740
See you at--

127
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:34,910
This is...

128
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,390
My new handmaiden.

129
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,220
The snake, the snake!

130
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,440
You mustn't pass that point.

131
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,940
Be warned!

132
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,030
The snake marks the "bounds of knowledge".

133
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,510
He has a habit of licking the pen when he's thinking hard.

134
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,630
He's not a dirty person.

135
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,800
What kind of a handmaiden uses the umbrella for herself?

136
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:03,720
Pardon?

137
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,100
Miss.

138
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,730
Miss!

139
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,900
Miss.

140
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,120
I don't have an upset stomach.
It's okay.

141
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,790
It's because the books are so boring.

142
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,790
You must read a ton of books.

143
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,040
You must be so knowledgeable.

144
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,010
I'm sorry about the prank.

145
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:46,930
I won't do it again.

146
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,180
Forgive me.

147
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,880
The Count?

148
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,920
Today?

149
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,300
No wonder you insisted on a bath.

150
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,140
When my aunt heard a guest was coming,

151
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,850
she dropped everything and bathed her Baby Miss.

152
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,140
Nothing made her happier than when guests praised the baby's scent.

153
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,400
You are my Baby Miss.

154
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,860
Auntie gives babies candy during baths

155
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,030
to teach them how sweet bath time is.

156
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,870
What's wrong?

157
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:51,200
One of my teeth must be sharp.
It keeps cutting me.

158
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,380
So this was the scent.

159
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,600
It's smooth now.

160
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,580
Welcome, sir!

161
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,510
You are too kind to greet me like this upon my arrival,

162
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,850
when the journey has left me so unkempt.

163
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,260
Now your tedium is over.

164
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:19,060
I'll ensure your painting lessons are stimulating.

165
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,480
This must be Okju.

166
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,900
At your service, milord.

167
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:30,610
You know if you fail, it'll put me in an awkward position?

168
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,330
A decent bone structure for a Korean...

169
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,540
So, are you carrying out your duties faithfully?

170
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,130
Thank you for introducing her.

171
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:47,960
You found the perfect maid for me.

172
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:54,010
It was tough looking for one that wasn't chubby.

173
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,180
Take care of the lonely lady.

174
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,480
Here.

175
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,040
Count Fujiwara asks Miss Hideko to kindly allow her maid Tamako

176
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:27,710
to be sent to his Lordship for a brief errand.

177
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,640
Did you call for me, milord?

178
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,560
You may enter.

179
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,560
You tried to fool me with a fake coin.

180
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,140
How dare you?

181
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,820
You think I'm Tamako, a poor Korean handmaiden.

182
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,240
But my real name is Nam Sookee.

183
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:42,910
Raised by Miss Boksun, top purveyor of stolen goods.

184
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,250
I was able to tell a real coin from a fake when I was 5.

185
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,420
Then learned to forge stamps from Gugai,

186
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,090
and pickpocketing from Kutan,

187
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,220
but these babies will never learn such useful skills.

188
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:01,310
Abandoned as newborns,

189
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,520
we'll wash and feed them, then sell them to Japan.

190
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,810
What meaningful work.

191
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:11,230
Instead of starving, they grow up to be rich gentlemen and ladies.

192
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,990
Kutan only breastfeeds her own kid.
I wouldn't be so miserly.

193
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:22,410
I wish my breasts gave milk.
I'd breastfeed all of them.

194
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,960
Count!

195
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:06,450
I'll tell you the story of an interpreter,

196
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:12,540
who bribed his way into translating for high officials.

197
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:17,630
After helping Japan annex Korea, he got rights to a gold mine.

198
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,590
Now he wants to turn fully Japanese.

199
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,640
So he gets naturalized,

200
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:28,520
marries the daughter of a fallen Japanese noble,

201
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,400
and adopts his wife's family name Kouzuki.

202
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:37,900
Ba... bas...

203
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:42,990
That bastard builds a mansion, fills it with books and antiques.

204
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:48,540
He invites Japanese collectors to his library,

205
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:52,670
holds readings of rare books, and auctions the books off.

206
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,050
He loves books and paintings like his own flesh,

207
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,550
but he can't help parting with a few.

208
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:01,550
What to do, when he must sell, but can't bear to?

209
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,090
He sells a fake.

210
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:11,140
He seeks out a specialist to create intricate forgeries.

211
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,940
Unlike him, this specialist...

212
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,480
is a real Japanese of noble birth!

213
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,450
Count Fujiwara from Nagoya.

214
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,240
So, who is this?

215
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,160
It's the wife. His Japanese wife.

216
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,540
- You'll seduce her--
- Is she pretty?

217
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,420
The Jap wife died ages ago with no children.

218
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:42,590
But the dead wife's dead sister's living daughter

219
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,140
performs those book readings.

220
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,430
But is she pretty?

221
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,100
She's an orphan. Her father was rich.

222
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,480
Soon she'll fall in love with me, and we'll elope to Japan.

223
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,350
After marrying her there

224
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,400
and inheriting her fortune, I'll declare her insane

225
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,440
and lock her up in a madhouse.

226
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,740
Right!

227
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,990
Sookee will be my mouse, work as her maid,

228
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,490
eavesdrop on her sleeptalking,

229
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,080
and hand her over to me.

230
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:16,670
Stay by her side during the day and gently persuade her to fall in love.

231
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,340
Love?

232
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,800
What does a crook know about love?

233
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,560
What about her fortune?
Is she rich for sure?

234
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,310
Every night in bed I think of her assets.

235
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:37,610
1.5 million in cash. 300,000 in bonds.

236
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,990
The uncle is just a guardian.
It's Hideko's fortune.

237
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,780
That's why Kouzuki schemes to marry the girl.

238
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,530
To his w... wife's niece?

239
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,330
What a s... sick f... f...

240
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,000
Right, a sick fuck.

241
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:58,290
So what's our share?

242
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,420
I'll share 50,000.

243
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,710
Sookee also gets the dresses and jewellery.

244
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,430
I'll do it! Take me!

245
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,680
My Japanese is better, and I've worked as a maid before!

246
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,030
On top of the fifty,

247
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,780
I get dresses, jewellery and my own 100,000.

248
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,790
B... b... beautiful!

249
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,710
I... I... I'm utterly speechless in your presence!

250
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:44,590
If you stutter like that and make your face go red,

251
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:47,260
those uppity bitches will feel superior,

252
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,340
and then they'll open up to you, all right?

253
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,140
Now, how to make your face go red.

254
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,720
Listen carefully. Breathe in,

255
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,020
pull in your stomach,

256
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,060
pull your chin down and tighten your butthole,

257
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,440
then hold your breath and swallow your saliva ten times.

258
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,770
Get it?

259
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,110
Let's just try it.

260
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:23,340
Would you like to wear a navy kimono with white peonies

261
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,840
or a black kimono with cranes?

262
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,050
Would you like to wear a caterpillar patterned poop color

263
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,550
or a poop patterned caterpillar color?

264
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,350
Don't ask! If you ask a question, she'll start to think.

265
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:39,350
You think, and she doesn't.

266
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,600
That's how you control the Miss.

267
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:42,690
All right?

268
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:43,610
All right.

269
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,450
Here's the letter. Pay attention.

270
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,830
"Dear Miss Izumi Hideko,

271
00:31:55,910 --> 00:32:00,710
Count Fujiwara has informed me of your urgent need for a maid.

272
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:04,630
A maid is like a pair of chopsticks.

273
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:09,010
Her presence is little noted, but her absence causes much distress."

274
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:14,800
Did my mom cry before they hanged her?

275
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,600
Women who stole once

276
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,890
and got hanged cried.

277
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,690
They cried a lot.

278
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,990
Your mother stole a thousand times,

279
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:33,700
was caught just once and died once.

280
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,780
Did she cry?

281
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,750
She laughed.

282
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,670
Said she was lucky to have you before dying

283
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,050
and that she had no regrets.

284
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:54,590
You will surely become a brave thief.

285
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,980
It should have been me!

286
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:16,490
I should be the one going to that Jap's house.

287
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,090
Everyone's talking about you in Eunpo,

288
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,840
how you'll be an even greater thief than your mother.

289
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,550
Who believes the words of a swindler?

290
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:41,390
When I give the signal, "fully ripe",

291
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,520
arrange for her and me to be alone.

292
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,600
Then I'll gobble her up to the pit.

293
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,940
She's so naive she wouldn't know what a man wants

294
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,400
even if he pulled on her nipples.

295
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,610
So it's your job to tell her

296
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,870
that everything is because of me.

297
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:01,120
"Oh my, since the Count arrived,

298
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,870
your toenails are growing much faster!"

299
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,000
That sort of thing, all right?

300
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,500
Here, a gift.

301
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,220
Oh, he's so thoughtful!

302
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:28,560
That'll be mine when she goes to the madhouse.

303
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:33,070
It pains my heart to see this poor girl.

304
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,690
Have you ever seen sapphires so blue?

305
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,120
Let's take a look...

306
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:46,870
This isn't a sapphire, it's blue spinel.

307
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:52,670
It's all right, Miss.
Spinels are expensive too.

308
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,130
How do you know?

309
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:00,090
Oh, my Auntie...
I mean, Lady Minami taught me.

310
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,470
But it's fine!

311
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,140
There's no need to be ashamed at all.

312
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,810
Your average fence can barely tell them apart.

313
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:07,850
Is that so?

314
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:25,290
Of all the things I've washed and dressed...

315
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,250
...has anything been this pretty?

316
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,790
I'd like to show her to the people at home.

317
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,670
What would they say?

318
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,470
Probably this?

319
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,050
Mesmerizing!

320
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:47,810
S... S... Spellbindingly beautiful.

321
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,790
He's shameless.

322
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:04,410
The Count kept offering me wine.

323
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,540
Does it feel okay?

324
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,750
It's suffocating.
How do ladies wear such things?

325
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,210
You think this is suffocating?

326
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,590
Miss, you're killing me!

327
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,180
Dressed up, you look like a lady too.

328
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,400
I think I know

329
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,070
what the Count meant.

330
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,240
Your face...

331
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,660
Every night in bed,

332
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,660
I think of your face.

333
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,210
Don't be silly, Miss.

334
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:04,380
Ladies truly are the dolls of maids.

335
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,890
All these buttons are for my amusement.

336
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,480
If I undo the buttons and pull out the cords...

337
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,280
...then the sweet things within...

338
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,280
...those sweet and soft things...

339
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:28,410
If I were still a pickpocket I'd slip my hand inside...

340
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:05,360
Miss, are you truly going to marry your uncle?

341
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,120
That's what he raised me for, knowing he'd need my fortune.

342
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,420
There's a famous collector in France.

343
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,790
He'll be putting his entire library up for auction.

344
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,590
The gold mine's proceeds won't cover the cost.

345
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:29,010
If it were me, I'd sell books to buy gold, not the opposite.

346
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:34,390
Have you ever thought of marrying someone else?

347
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,180
Like Count Fujiwara, for example--

348
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,560
You're very nosy for a handmaiden.

349
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:13,470
For now, the Lady needn't go read to the sick fuck,
who wants to marry his wife's niece.

350
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,940
Instead the fake Count goes to the Library to make fake books.

351
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:29,070
The Lady waits for her 2 o'clock art class, and waits...

352
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:35,890
Poor girl, losing her heart to a fake.

353
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,450
Please, Count!

354
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,170
Sorry to be late.

355
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,210
It's fine.

356
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:21,730
Maybe I need more practice to give it dimensionality.

357
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:24,310
Dimensionality... perhaps.

358
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,810
Nonetheless, you have a vision that transcends mere skill.

359
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,570
It's as if you see directly into an object's essence.

360
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:36,660
For example, the fact that this peach contains a lot of water.

361
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:42,370
I hesitate to stand before you,
for fear that you might read my thoughts.

362
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,670
That's enough for today.

363
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:07,320
Almost fully ripe.

364
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,400
Already?

365
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,320
Damn...

366
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,580
Do you know what?

367
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:24,370
Since the Count arrived, your cheeks have grown flushed.

368
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:25,370
Have they?

369
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,210
How did your mother die?

370
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:40,760
When I was a baby, at a big house, she was hanged...

371
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:44,810
- I mean, she hanged--
- Hanged herself like my aunt, huh?

372
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,350
Well, pretty much.

373
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:59,280
She must have often hugged you when she was alive, right?

374
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:07,660
My mother died giving birth to me.

375
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:15,550
So it's as if I strangled her myself.

376
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:20,180
I wish I'd never been born.

377
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,980
No baby is ever guilty of being born.

378
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:32,800
If your mother thought you could understand,
this is what she'd have said.

379
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:37,190
That she was so lucky to have you before dying...

380
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,860
...that she had no regrets.

381
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,620
Wait here a moment, Miss.

382
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,420
I'll go pick mushrooms.

383
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:56,550
We'll have mushroom stew tonight, you like that.

384
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,130
I'll go with you.

385
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,550
I'll be quick.

386
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,550
Before it rains.

387
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,020
Good girl--

388
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,360
What a coincidence.

389
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,030
Indeed.

390
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:23,740
May I sit next to you?

391
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,770
The lady sits, shy and trembling.

392
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:56,690
The gentleman is persistent.

393
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,150
The perceptive maid has stepped out for a moment.

394
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,660
All is well, Sookee.

395
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:08,450
Everyone's performing their roles so damned well.

396
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:11,290
Damn.

397
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:19,300
You know servants can't use this entrance!

398
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:28,970
Hey!

399
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,360
I wish I'd never come here.

400
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:42,070
It was wrong to come.

401
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,740
Tamako, you brought watercolors, right?

402
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,580
Of course, milord!

403
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,080
Watercolor paints and brushes--

404
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,250
Go and get the oils.

405
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:56,850
A day like this demands oils.

406
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:20,490
Shit!

407
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,320
Lady!

408
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,600
Milord!

409
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:45,760
Lady...

410
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:10,110
A blackout! Bring a lantern.

411
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,260
I need to think.

412
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,920
I need to become rich...

413
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:41,600
...sail off to a distant harbor, eat food I scarcely recognize,
buy my fill of glittering baubles, and...

414
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:43,820
...not think of Hideko.

415
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,490
Never think of Hideko--

416
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,010
I returned and you didn't even come to me.

417
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,020
It was late, I must have fallen asleep.
My apologies.

418
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,730
You know how hard it is to do those readings?

419
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:29,690
Must I remove my makeup and change all by myself?

420
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,910
I feel a nightmare coming. Sleep here.

421
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:00,560
He proposed to me.

422
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,360
On the 15th...

423
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:10,940
...when my uncle visits his mine, he wants to elope to Japan.

424
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:15,660
What did you say?

425
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,370
I said I wasn't sure.

426
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:21,290
Why?

427
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:23,120
I'm scared.

428
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:25,540
Of your uncle's anger?

429
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:29,130
Of the Count.

430
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,380
What's to be scared of? He's so kind.

431
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:39,010
I don't know, I just feel it.

432
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:45,940
It's like the reflex of pulling your hand back from a flame.

433
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:50,900
Tell me...

434
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,540
What is it that men want?

435
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:06,080
Pardon?

436
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:11,000
I mean after getting married, at night...

437
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:18,800
How would I know?
I'm practically a child with no mother.

438
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,410
There's no one here to...

439
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:28,730
First.

440
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,900
I guess we'd kiss?

441
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:36,860
And?

442
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,580
He would hold you in his arms.

443
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:42,240
Standing?

444
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:46,910
Only when there's nowhere to lie down or you're in a hurry.

445
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,880
Normally you do it on the bed.

446
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,590
You'll know when it happens.

447
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:54,710
It's just like drinking for the first time.

448
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,970
When it happens?

449
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,640
But...

450
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:04,470
Could someone be like a blind person,

451
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:09,100
not being able to feel it?

452
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:12,030
What the hell.

453
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:14,480
I'll show her one thing then put her to bed.

454
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:24,900
Poor thing, alone in a strange country, reading those useless books...

455
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:28,410
...without learning a single useful skill.

456
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,230
Why does the candy taste different?

457
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:53,110
The bitterness turns sour...

458
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:56,110
...the sourness turns sweet...

459
00:51:56,730 --> 00:52:00,120
...the sweetness turns savoury...

460
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,780
How do you know all this?

461
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,990
Do you have experience?

462
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:10,750
My friend Kutan taught me.

463
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,670
Taught you? With words?

464
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:16,090
Yes, only with words.

465
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,940
So this is how it feels.

466
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,190
That's what you will feel for the Count.

467
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,200
Really?

468
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:44,570
The Count, truly...

469
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:50,540
He won't think he's making love to a corpse?

470
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,830
You know about my cold hands and feet.

471
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:56,670
Really?

472
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:58,250
Here.

473
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,850
It feels just fine.

474
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:10,220
You like it?

475
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:15,100
Do it to me. I want to know how it feels.

476
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:23,820
I'm sure he'll want to do this too.

477
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:25,530
And then...

478
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,250
It's so cute.

479
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,920
If the Count sees this...

480
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:52,270
Will he really be as tender as this?

481
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:54,440
Of course.

482
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,360
He'll also touch you like this.

483
00:53:57,770 --> 00:53:58,610
And like this...

484
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:04,860
Keep doing what the Count will.

485
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:11,120
And this is what he'll say.

486
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:17,000
"It's so soft, warm,

487
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:20,540
wet, and...

488
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:25,300
s... s... spellbindingly beautiful!"

489
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,820
Okju.

490
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:52,740
Hideko.

491
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,920
Mom.

492
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:02,000
Dad.

493
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,130
Now, the model must stay still.

494
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:10,680
Okju.

495
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:18,390
- Hideko...
- Wait.

496
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,900
Stop!

497
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:24,190
...doesn't like it, you damned scoundrel!

498
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:27,150
Stop it!

499
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,360
I can't do this.

500
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:33,580
Come here, Tamako.

501
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:39,420
Find something else to keep you busy.

502
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,620
Do you know what I mean?

503
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,760
I have nothing else to do.

504
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:56,140
My job is to look after the Lady.

505
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:10,650
I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

506
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:12,740
She's fully ripe! Fully ripe!

507
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,450
If I miss this chance, I'm finished!

508
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:18,290
Can you feel it?
How much I want it?

509
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:23,100
After fighting so hard to escape my garbage heap of a life...

510
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:26,820
...you think I'll let you ruin it, you bitch?

511
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:32,180
Shall I tell the Lady you're nothing but a lowly pickpocket?

512
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:35,760
Fine, I'll have something to tell her too.

513
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:40,200
That you're nothing but the son of
a lowly Korean farmhand and shaman--

514
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,430
Sookee.

515
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,480
Think of your family at home.

516
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,280
Boksun raising babies with her bad back and those two idiots.

517
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:50,030
How will they feel if you go home empty-handed?

518
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,900
Want to ruin your mother's reputation?

519
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,320
You should go home in glory.

520
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:03,500
So don't push Hideko too hard.

521
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:04,960
She's got no one on this earth.

522
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,130
If you frighten her, she'll close up hard as a clam.

523
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,720
And please...

524
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:18,810
Don't ever again put my hand on your tiny joke of a cock.

525
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:28,900
Oh my.

526
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,860
Your toenails have grown faster since the Count arrived.

527
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,450
How curious.

528
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:39,870
Miss, doesn't it bother you not to know?

529
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:43,910
How many ships sail on the wide sea,

530
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:47,040
people leaving, people returning,

531
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,800
those saying farewell or welcoming people back.

532
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,340
Where is the farthest you've traveled?

533
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:53,880
The hill beyond the manor?

534
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:05,060
My uncle will chase me wherever I go.

535
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,820
This is how I lived my life.

536
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:16,240
I could be content here, if you are with me.

537
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:26,420
You can walk with me in new shoes, tell me stories...

538
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:32,300
...and massage my feet.

539
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,550
You're fortunate, Miss.

540
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:40,600
The man who loves you has the power to protect you.

541
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,680
That's rare.

542
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:47,770
But I'm not sure... if I love him.

543
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,150
You do love him.

544
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:55,490
How do you know?

545
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,320
You stare out the window all day,

546
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:02,580
turn in your sleep and sigh...

547
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,440
...and your toenails...

548
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:08,540
What if I said I don't love him?

549
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:12,670
What if I said that I love someone else?

550
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:18,510
I have no one on this earth...

551
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:21,300
Would you still want me to marry him?

552
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:26,730
You will love him.

553
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:43,700
Miss!

554
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:36,050
In the end, Hideko accepted the proposal,
provided that I go to Japan too.

555
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:40,840
The Count, after feigning
annoyance for a bit, nodded his head.

556
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:49,390
On the day her Uncle left to visit his mine,
the Count pretended to go back to Japan and hid nearby.

557
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,750
You'll have a week of freedom...

558
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:10,540
...but always remember the basement.

559
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:57,620
Miss!

560
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:05,820
Thank you for traveling on our ferry today.

561
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:11,370
We will arrive at Shimonoseki at 7:30 p.m.

562
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:19,790
We're finally going home.

563
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:23,590
- It's been three years...
- It's been a long time.

564
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,350
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

565
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:46,170
To not steal...

566
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:48,460
To not steal...

567
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,340
To not commit adultery...

568
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,380
To not commit adultery...

569
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:55,300
To not lie...

570
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:57,680
To not lie...

571
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:39,070
♪ Spider thread pulled into strings ♪

572
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:44,000
♪ Strumming makes a zither sing ♪

573
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:47,210
♪ A thousand woes-- ♪

574
01:06:54,460 --> 01:07:01,300
♪ Under the blue sky only the crows cry ♪

575
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:07,020
♪ How sorrowful my zither ♪

576
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:10,690
♪ My beloved zither... ♪

577
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:23,120
Did you sleep well?

578
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:34,460
Excuse me.

579
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:36,630
Sorry.

580
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:46,810
The Count paid the innkeeper to spy on us, afraid we might run off.

581
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:49,900
Why get dressed?
I've nothing to do anyway.

582
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:54,070
Things are moving too slowly.

583
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:57,610
I fear Hideko might truly go mad.

584
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,360
Shall we play "maid", like before?

585
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:07,580
There is no sign of the Count from morning to night.

586
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:12,330
Certifying the marriage and converting the inheritance to cash

587
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:13,750
require much work, he says.

588
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,880
How could you be so cruel?

589
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,300
You plucked the flower, now re-plant it.

590
01:08:58,380 --> 01:08:59,840
What do you want?

591
01:09:00,510 --> 01:09:03,720
Hurry up and throw her into the madhouse!

592
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:39,840
After a week...

593
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:51,520
...finally...

594
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:39,690
This way.

595
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:47,860
They're from the madhouse.

596
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:49,160
You know what to say.

597
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:05,590
Who is that person?

598
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:08,130
The Countess Lady Fujiwara.

599
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:10,970
Her maiden name was Izumi Hideko.

600
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,640
And who might you be?

601
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,430
I am the Lady's handmaiden.

602
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:18,690
- What's your name?
- It's Tamako.

603
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:22,900
Then, what kind of treatment

604
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:26,320
do you believe your Lady requires?

605
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:44,130
She should be confined in a place

606
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:50,050
where no one can harm her and where she can do no harm.

607
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:59,520
Just a few tests, then let's have lamb chops at the Peace Hotel.

608
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,000
It's almost over. Good work.

609
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,880
Don't be frightened.

610
01:12:57,490 --> 01:12:59,580
Good day, Countess.

611
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:01,920
Do you remember me?

612
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:06,290
Countess?

613
01:13:15,970 --> 01:13:17,350
What is this?

614
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:20,350
We mean you no harm, Countess.

615
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:22,440
We're going to look after you.

616
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:27,520
You've got the wrong person.
She is the Countess.

617
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,320
Tell them, Your Lordship!

618
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:35,820
She still believes she's a Korean handmaiden.

619
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:41,040
It's because her nanny was Korean.

620
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:42,910
You scoundrel!

621
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:46,880
Let go of me, you filthy bitches!

622
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,590
We do not use such language here, your Ladyship.

623
01:13:50,670 --> 01:13:51,970
Miss!

624
01:13:56,470 --> 01:14:00,890
My poor Lady, she's gone nuts.

625
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:04,190
If it would be of any help,

626
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:08,980
this is from her mother and she used to cherish it

627
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,360
before going mad.

628
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:19,120
Such a considerate maid.

629
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:24,960
You may have thought that Hideko was a fool.

630
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,290
A fool... maybe not.

631
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:32,590
I tell you, right from the start Miss Izumi Hideko...

632
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:37,470
had always been...

633
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:38,970
Miss!

634
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:41,720
...a rotten bitch.

635
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:50,590
PART TWO

636
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:53,570
I'm not a rotten bitch!
No! No!

637
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:02,370
Put it in your mouth, Hideko.

638
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:06,960
Hold out your hand.

639
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:29,020
Next time you feel like talking back,

640
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:32,770
remember the taste of this metal bead.

641
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:41,740
You'll sleep alone from tonight.

642
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:54,590
- All right?
- Please give me a light.

643
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:58,170
We've been ordered to save oil.

644
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,430
You little brat.

645
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:01,930
Speak Japanese!

646
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:08,560
In there is a man the size of an ogre

647
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:12,770
who can't stand the sound of girls screaming.

648
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:16,940
If he hears you, he'll burst in through that door after you.

649
01:16:18,190 --> 01:16:19,320
And then?

650
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:27,410
He'll smother you with his giant body,

651
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:30,160
so you can't make a sound.

652
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:45,600
Aunt.

653
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:47,970
My, my.

654
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,230
Scaring a little girl like that.

655
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,530
And me?

656
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:46,870
Am I pretty too?

657
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:52,290
Look closely.

658
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:59,500
Everyone says I can't compare

659
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,130
to my big sister.

660
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:07,680
Day.

661
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:09,140
Night.

662
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:10,560
Day.

663
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:12,140
Night.

664
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:14,310
Man.

665
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:15,770
Woman.

666
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:17,770
Man.

667
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:19,360
Woman.

668
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:23,570
Eye.

669
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:25,240
Nose.

670
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:27,160
Mouth.

671
01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:28,780
Ear.

672
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:30,790
Shoulder.

673
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:32,660
Nipple.

674
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:34,210
Navel.

675
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:35,830
Eye.

676
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:37,420
Nose.

677
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:38,960
Mouth.

678
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:40,630
Ear.

679
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:42,550
Shoulder.

680
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:43,670
Nipple.

681
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:45,300
Navel.

682
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:49,890
Penis.

683
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:51,640
Vagina.

684
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,770
P... penis.

685
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,650
Vagina.

686
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:41,230
Do you think I won't understand if you speak Korean?

687
01:19:44,190 --> 01:19:48,740
I was going a bit crazy and wanted everyone else to go crazy too.

688
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:56,500
When Mrs. Sasaki looked as crazy as I,

689
01:19:56,580 --> 01:19:58,830
life was more bearable.

690
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:20,980
I know you are a bit insane.

691
01:20:21,770 --> 01:20:25,020
It runs in your mother's family.

692
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:28,530
That's why I'm training you,

693
01:20:28,610 --> 01:20:29,820
to set your mind right.

694
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:35,160
If I fail, there's a place called a "mental hospital" in Japan.

695
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,710
Established by rational Germans,

696
01:20:41,790 --> 01:20:45,630
it's very effective in treating lunacy.

697
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:49,920
They dig holes in the dirt, put a patient in each one,

698
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:51,430
and put lids on top.

699
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:54,050
When the patients get better, they get a leash,

700
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:57,970
so they can crawl around like dogs.

701
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:29,170
The cherry tree that came with me on the ship from Japan

702
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:30,920
bloomed twice.

703
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:35,720
"When Jinlian finally took off her clothes,

704
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:39,020
Ximen-Qing-examined her-Jade-Gate...

705
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:42,850
To-find-it-hairless-as-white-as-snow and-as-smooth-as-jade..."

706
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,440
You must pause between words.

707
01:21:48,650 --> 01:21:51,570
Don't read like a dog lapping at his plate!

708
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:56,870
Listen to your aunt read.

709
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,670
"When Jinlian finally took off her clothes,

710
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:12,550
Ximen Qing examined her Jade Gate...

711
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:14,050
DISCOVERING THE SECRET WELL

712
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:18,220
...to find it hairless, as white as snow,

713
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,770
and as smooth as jade.

714
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:23,560
As tight as a drum,

715
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:25,980
and as soft as silk.

716
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:31,730
Once he drew apart the curtains of flesh,

717
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:38,570
a scent of well-aged wine emanated from within,

718
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:45,160
and on fold upon fold of the red velvet interior

719
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:47,290
beads of dew were forming.

720
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:53,760
Its center was dark and void,

721
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:57,640
yet as if it had its own life,

722
01:22:58,220 --> 01:23:02,260
it twitched and twitched."

723
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:34,960
Everyone wanted to cut it down, but my uncle refused.

724
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:41,510
He said this tree from Mt. Fuji had absorbed my aunt's soul.

725
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:48,100
The servants whispered it was due to the tree's high cost,

726
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:50,940
but I think my uncle was right.

727
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:54,150
You can tell from the cherry blossoms,

728
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:57,610
which turned brighter and bloomed longer.

729
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:33,310
"Tell me, Juliette.

730
01:24:33,690 --> 01:24:37,150
Do you wish for this impetuous young knight to save you?

731
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:40,700
The duchess shook her head resolutely,

732
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:53,380
to my great disappointment.

733
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:56,920
Now,

734
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,050
my brave knight."

735
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:07,140
Oh, it's a new face!

736
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:11,980
Now,

737
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:13,940
my brave knight.

738
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:21,990
When you see these old scars and the fresh pink wounds,

739
01:25:22,070 --> 01:25:23,780
what do you feel?

740
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:29,830
I pity the poor woman.

741
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:34,920
I wish to lick her and lick her, caress her and caress her.

742
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:38,300
If you pity her so,

743
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:43,380
why not take her place and let her whip you?

744
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:54,400
The duchess raised the whip high in the air, and then...

745
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,240
And again...

746
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:14,870
My cock became painfully erect.

747
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:24,800
If she could be yours for ten minutes,

748
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,720
what would you give in exchange?

749
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:30,720
Whatever your heart desires.

750
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:33,980
Anything in this whole wide world.

751
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:39,230
Once the duke untied me,

752
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:42,820
I sat on the chair, pulled her to me,

753
01:26:43,610 --> 01:26:47,740
and slid my cock into her cunt.

754
01:26:53,410 --> 01:26:56,420
Oh, Juliette, Juliette...

755
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:03,590
As I felt the duke approach from behind,

756
01:27:03,670 --> 01:27:06,380
a rope slithered around my neck.

757
01:27:07,930 --> 01:27:10,680
The duke slowly tightened the rope.

758
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:15,810
Like a drowning man grasping at straws,

759
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:20,310
I pulled the swirling currents of her hair.

760
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:23,820
Then the duke spoke.

761
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:28,950
The ten minutes are almost up.

762
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:41,250
Slowly, my dear, said the Duchess...

763
01:27:41,710 --> 01:27:48,470
I haven't yet fully savored his pain.

764
01:27:54,430 --> 01:27:57,980
No, the knight cried, don't stop!

765
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:03,360
Please let me die

766
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,610
in the midst of this pain.

767
01:28:06,070 --> 01:28:08,530
In this suffocating pain.

768
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,570
Is it Sade?

769
01:28:54,410 --> 01:28:56,080
It's Sade-esque.

770
01:28:56,620 --> 01:29:01,670
It is believed to be the same Japanese man who wrote The Lizard Skin.

771
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:07,050
It was acquired from a Japanese sailor on a ship from Hamburg.

772
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:20,390
Cheap hair and shabby clothes,

773
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:23,480
old and worn down,

774
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:26,980
a body foul with food waste and human secretion.

775
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:33,410
Can you imagine my joy when

776
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:38,080
after such a journey,

777
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:42,960
it sat on my shelf with its brothers?

778
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,380
Even compared with an unopened

779
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:47,670
first-edition of Milton's, it wouldn't be outstripped.

780
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:50,420
That's right.

781
01:29:51,170 --> 01:29:56,010
These are the babes to whom I feel the most affection.

782
01:29:57,300 --> 01:30:03,270
It used to contain an elaborate monochrome woodcut illustration,

783
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:07,020
but as you can see...

784
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:08,440
So unfortunate.

785
01:30:10,610 --> 01:30:14,780
If that were intact, you could've named your price.

786
01:30:16,530 --> 01:30:20,910
The author felt words alone could not fully describe the positions,

787
01:30:20,990 --> 01:30:24,710
and so included an illustration.

788
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:29,340
In that regard, before we start the bidding...

789
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:31,130
Hideko!

790
01:30:31,630 --> 01:30:33,720
Why don't you show us this scene?

791
01:31:12,130 --> 01:31:15,130
PAIN IS A GARMENT

792
01:32:37,630 --> 01:32:39,010
Beautiful!

793
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:47,770
See you again.

794
01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:50,520
Yes, thank you.

795
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:53,440
Today's reading was outstanding.

796
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:55,520
Yes, thank you.

797
01:32:56,230 --> 01:32:58,900
Especially the puppet!

798
01:33:27,180 --> 01:33:29,100
You are of noble birth,

799
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:33,940
yet you engage in the lowly work of copying paintings.

800
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:37,270
There was a time

801
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:40,360
when I dissipated my wit and skills on gambling.

802
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:44,320
Imagine the torment of having so many women

803
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:46,120
make advances on me,

804
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:48,910
when I couldn't afford to buy them a glass of Burgundy.

805
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:54,670
Do the women here make advances on you?

806
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:57,420
I look at women's eyes,

807
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:58,670
only the eyes.

808
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:03,130
They turn their gaze away,

809
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:05,720
but then they always look back.

810
01:34:06,090 --> 01:34:08,930
It's a silent exchange of question and answer.

811
01:34:09,890 --> 01:34:14,850
If I were to slide under someone's covers tonight,

812
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:19,360
only one woman here would refuse me.

813
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,240
Does that include Mrs. Sasaki?

814
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:29,410
Is she not your former wife?

815
01:34:29,910 --> 01:34:32,750
You left her to marry a Japanese woman.

816
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:36,750
But the servants tell me you still share a bed with her.

817
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:41,800
Can I ask you something?

818
01:34:44,970 --> 01:34:46,130
Of course.

819
01:34:47,550 --> 01:34:52,220
You went so far as to abandon your wife, why this urge to become Japanese?

820
01:34:54,850 --> 01:34:56,560
Because Korea is ugly

821
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:59,860
and Japan is beautiful.

822
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:04,190
Some Japanese say Japan is ugly,

823
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:05,780
and Korea is beautiful.

824
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:08,780
Beauty is cruel by nature.

825
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:12,870
Korea is soft, slow, dull, and therefore hopeless.

826
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:18,630
Let's talk about that one woman who would deny you.

827
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,920
Does it include Mrs. Sasaki?

828
01:35:26,010 --> 01:35:28,010
Mrs. Sasaki...

829
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:31,890
If I gave her the right signal,

830
01:35:31,970 --> 01:35:36,350
she'd knock on my door without her underwear.

831
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:46,110
My thoughts exactly.

832
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:49,660
Then who is it?

833
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:52,410
The one who would deny you?

834
01:35:54,910 --> 01:35:57,830
I heard you own the highest quality

835
01:35:57,910 --> 01:36:01,540
antique bookmaking tools of the East and West,

836
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:03,710
but I don't see them here.

837
01:36:04,090 --> 01:36:06,340
I'll show them to you later.

838
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:13,640
Who is the one person to refuse you?

839
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:21,020
I met Hideko's eyes by chance, but she didn't look away.

840
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:24,400
Indeed it was I, who shifted my gaze.

841
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:25,570
Hideko,

842
01:36:26,190 --> 01:36:31,910
Will she make an appearance in your lewd dreams tonight?

843
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:36,830
Even if honored with such a visit,

844
01:36:37,410 --> 01:36:39,790
I don't think I could consummate.

845
01:36:40,330 --> 01:36:44,250
I would happily regret it the moment I begin

846
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:48,050
because her body would be as cold as a waterfowl.

847
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:55,680
That is the result of long training.

848
01:36:57,470 --> 01:37:00,810
I heard you are engaged to her.

849
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:10,610
If I'm not mistaken, you are yet to have intercourse?

850
01:37:11,740 --> 01:37:14,450
Her eyes have no desire.

851
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:17,410
It means her soul is dead inside.

852
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:21,120
You should go easy on her training,

853
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:25,290
unless you enjoy making love to a corpse.

854
01:37:48,820 --> 01:37:50,280
Would you like a smoke?

855
01:37:58,950 --> 01:38:02,790
How did such a noble count

856
01:38:02,870 --> 01:38:07,040
fall into the grouty habit of smoking cigarettes?

857
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:04,270
This is my particular way of possessing beauty.

858
01:39:05,890 --> 01:39:09,400
Hideko too must have received painting lessons.

859
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:12,110
No, she did not.

860
01:39:12,730 --> 01:39:17,030
I was too occupied teaching her to read with correct diction.

861
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:19,280
Is that so?

862
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:21,950
In England, where I studied,

863
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:28,080
all ladies were expected to produce vibrant color and graceful lines,

864
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:31,290
even in the less noble families.

865
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,520
You have a phone call, sir.

866
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,190
At this hour?

867
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:56,950
It's the Iwamura Bookstore.

868
01:39:57,950 --> 01:39:59,280
Is that so?

869
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,320
Excuse me a moment.

870
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:12,920
You are mesmerizing.

871
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:17,630
Men use the word "mesmerizing"

872
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:20,680
when they wish to touch a lady's breasts.

873
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:25,220
I'm familiar with Western conversational etiquette.

874
01:40:27,430 --> 01:40:30,270
I do a bit of reading, you know.

875
01:40:30,980 --> 01:40:32,900
There was no calculation in what I said.

876
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:37,900
It was a reflex, like pulling one's hand from a flame.

877
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:40,360
I'm no flame.

878
01:40:41,110 --> 01:40:44,620
I'm cold as a waterfowl, your Lordship.

879
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:52,670
He will return soon.

880
01:40:52,750 --> 01:40:55,340
Mr. Iwamura only called with a frivolous inquiry,

881
01:40:55,420 --> 01:40:57,460
at my request.

882
01:40:57,550 --> 01:41:01,180
There's an issue regarding your future you should know.

883
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:04,470
I'll wait by the stone lamp at midnight.

884
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:09,390
That Iwamura is a real fool.

885
01:41:15,570 --> 01:41:17,400
Good night, Miss.

886
01:42:28,810 --> 01:42:30,930
My maid is asleep in the room next door.

887
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:33,310
I don't fancy being in scandalous rumors with you.

888
01:42:33,390 --> 01:42:36,940
I saw Junko go to the servants' quarters with her pillow.

889
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:39,150
Consider your reputation as a nobleman.

890
01:42:39,770 --> 01:42:41,570
I'm no nobleman.

891
01:42:41,650 --> 01:42:43,440
I'm not even Japanese.

892
01:42:43,530 --> 01:42:46,110
Do you think it was easy for a Korean farmhand's son to reach here?

893
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:50,740
After fifteen hard years in Japan, I heard some things about you.

894
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:53,120
Another three years were spent to prepare.

895
01:42:53,790 --> 01:42:56,670
I studied bookmaking and learned to paint forgeries.

896
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:59,540
All so that I could meet you.

897
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,460
To seduce and marry you,

898
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:04,050
to possess your father's inheritance,

899
01:43:04,670 --> 01:43:06,300
and then probably to get rid of you.

900
01:43:08,430 --> 01:43:09,930
But I knew as soon as I met you.

901
01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:12,350
For a man to seduce you would be--

902
01:43:14,890 --> 01:43:15,980
...impossible.

903
01:43:17,770 --> 01:43:21,110
So in place of seduction, I decided to propose a deal.

904
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:26,070
Most marriages are like being imprisoned, but this one will free you.

905
01:43:26,910 --> 01:43:28,740
I'll rescue you from here,

906
01:43:28,820 --> 01:43:32,290
take you far away, and give you freedom.

907
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:35,960
Of course, we'll split the money.

908
01:43:37,170 --> 01:43:38,540
Nonsense.

909
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:42,500
Does marrying an old man with a black tongue

910
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:44,050
at your tender age makes sense?

911
01:43:44,130 --> 01:43:46,260
I won't marry anyone.

912
01:43:46,340 --> 01:43:47,680
What have you in mind?

913
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:55,100
That's not proper.

914
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:56,810
There's no beauty in that.

915
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:59,690
If you kill yourself, what of your fortune?

916
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:04,610
That will be the sum of your efforts?
Your fortune going to that pervert?

917
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:08,570
So he can buy 10 little girls and teach them to read books?

918
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:12,870
My uncle will find us somehow.

919
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:14,700
Then he'll take us to the basement.

920
01:44:15,830 --> 01:44:16,910
Uncle.

921
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:18,960
The basement?

922
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:22,340
It says here when people are hanged,

923
01:44:22,420 --> 01:44:27,170
their tongues stick out and faeces is expelled.

924
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:32,350
But that day, aunt's mouth was shut

925
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:35,060
and her bottom was clean.

926
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:38,690
Do you want to go somewhere nice?

927
01:44:56,450 --> 01:45:00,290
I'll tell you in detail what I did to your aunt

928
01:45:00,370 --> 01:45:02,130
after I caught her running away.

929
01:45:02,750 --> 01:45:07,300
So don't you ever think of running, understood?

930
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:26,940
That day I just watched and listened.

931
01:45:27,690 --> 01:45:31,200
But if I ever end up there again...

932
01:45:35,990 --> 01:45:37,330
This is highly concentrated opium.

933
01:45:37,830 --> 01:45:39,660
Three drops will make you sleep all day.

934
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:42,580
Five drops will knock down a horse.

935
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:44,880
If you crave death within five minutes,

936
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,670
drink it all.

937
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:51,090
If you carry this, he can never take you to the basement.

938
01:45:51,170 --> 01:45:52,260
At least not alive.

939
01:45:53,430 --> 01:45:55,010
It'll be my wedding gift to you.

940
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:57,390
It's more expensive than jewels.

941
01:46:09,070 --> 01:46:14,030
Bring a girl to be my maid.
One who could disappear and not be missed.

942
01:46:14,450 --> 01:46:16,160
If a bit dense, all the better.

943
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:20,330
We'll send her to a madhouse under my name.

944
01:46:22,750 --> 01:46:24,670
They dig a hole in the ground,

945
01:46:24,750 --> 01:46:27,590
put a patient in there and close the lid.

946
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:31,090
I want my name to be buried in that hole.

947
01:46:32,130 --> 01:46:34,630
I can find you a new maid,

948
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:36,930
but what do we do about Junko?

949
01:46:42,310 --> 01:46:47,270
You really think I'm prettier than Miss Hideko?

950
01:46:48,690 --> 01:46:52,780
Sure, Hideko's pretty, and you're pretty.

951
01:46:52,860 --> 01:46:54,570
What? You speak Korean?

952
01:46:56,240 --> 01:46:57,700
You know...

953
01:46:58,780 --> 01:46:59,620
I learned it.

954
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:02,580
To speak more easily with you.

955
01:47:04,370 --> 01:47:06,830
I really wanted to say this to you.

956
01:47:08,540 --> 01:47:10,090
You are just mesmerizing.

957
01:47:10,170 --> 01:47:11,590
Oh my gosh!

958
01:47:13,550 --> 01:47:15,130
You little tart!

959
01:47:20,260 --> 01:47:22,310
I can't!

960
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:25,480
If they catch me with a guest, I'll be thrown out!

961
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:30,980
Forget this wretched place.
Come live with me!

962
01:48:18,030 --> 01:48:19,160
Oh, fucking hell!

963
01:48:20,070 --> 01:48:21,160
Fucking hell?

964
01:48:21,240 --> 01:48:22,620
Fucking hell...

965
01:49:13,540 --> 01:49:16,210
The Count sent exactly what I ordered.

966
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:18,510
Naive and a bit foolish.

967
01:49:22,340 --> 01:49:24,600
We're alike, somehow.

968
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:26,680
I heard you're an orphan, too.

969
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:32,230
Mother!

970
01:49:43,490 --> 01:49:48,290
Show Sookee your clothes and jewellery at every opportunity.

971
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:53,080
The material greed she got from her mother will make her more gullible.

972
01:49:53,170 --> 01:49:59,170
P.S. Don't worry if she reads this letter, she's totally illiterate.

973
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:00,760
Would you read it to me?

974
01:50:01,170 --> 01:50:02,260
Pardon?

975
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:07,430
"...looking for a maid.
Maids are like...

976
01:50:08,510 --> 01:50:10,020
a spoon... no...

977
01:50:12,100 --> 01:50:14,560
are like chopsticks..."

978
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:20,440
Is it a spoon?

979
01:50:20,530 --> 01:50:21,400
COUNTESS FUJIWARA HIDEKO

980
01:50:21,490 --> 01:50:24,280
This is your name. Can't you read it?

981
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:31,160
What's with your foot?

982
01:50:35,710 --> 01:50:36,540
Who did it?

983
01:50:37,340 --> 01:50:39,340
Who took Tamako 's shoe?

984
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:48,260
Apologize before all the servants!

985
01:50:52,220 --> 01:50:55,100
If she ever runs away because of one of you,

986
01:50:55,190 --> 01:50:57,060
I'll strip you all naked and throw you out!

987
01:50:58,860 --> 01:50:59,820
Fucking hell.

988
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:05,780
All smooth.

989
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:14,210
Do you like the scent?

990
01:51:15,250 --> 01:51:16,870
Do you want to come in?

991
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:17,790
Pardon?

992
01:51:38,350 --> 01:51:39,940
This must be Okju.

993
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:42,940
At your service, milord.

994
01:51:43,860 --> 01:51:47,450
You know if you fail, it'll put me in an awkward position.

995
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:56,210
A decent bone structure for a Korean...

996
01:51:59,670 --> 01:52:04,090
So, are you carrying out your duties faithfully?

997
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:10,550
- What?
- Thank you for introducing her.

998
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:15,640
You found the perfect maid for me.

999
01:52:16,730 --> 01:52:20,400
It was tough looking for one that wasn't chubby.

1000
01:52:21,190 --> 01:52:24,440
Take care of the lonely lady.

1001
01:52:25,110 --> 01:52:25,940
Here.

1002
01:52:28,990 --> 01:52:31,910
Becoming the lady's friend

1003
01:52:31,990 --> 01:52:33,870
and getting paid for it

1004
01:52:34,330 --> 01:52:35,750
is nothing to be ashamed of.

1005
01:52:38,410 --> 01:52:40,170
Isn't that right, Miss?

1006
01:52:42,290 --> 01:52:43,960
There's no need to be ashamed at all.

1007
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:46,340
Your average fence can barely tell them apart.

1008
01:52:46,420 --> 01:52:48,420
Is that so?

1009
01:52:53,970 --> 01:52:55,970
"I'm returning the earrings you loaned me.

1010
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:59,440
A woman might wager her fate on such an exquisite pair.

1011
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:03,310
I'm sure that Sookee will try her very best

1012
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:07,780
in order to see herself wearing these in the mirror.

1013
01:53:08,610 --> 01:53:12,110
I'll tell you how to keep her from getting suspicious.

1014
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:15,330
Keep her busy until the day of the wedding.

1015
01:53:15,830 --> 01:53:17,950
Make her spend all her energy

1016
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:20,370
on making you fall in love with me."

1017
01:53:22,290 --> 01:53:25,630
In other words, don't fall in love with me so easily.

1018
01:53:36,470 --> 01:53:37,310
Mesmerizing!

1019
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:41,520
Me?

1020
01:53:50,690 --> 01:53:53,160
Dressed up, you look like a lady too.

1021
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:03,120
Almost fully ripe.

1022
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:15,300
How did your mother die?

1023
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:19,180
That she was so lucky to have you before dying.

1024
01:54:20,020 --> 01:54:22,060
That she had no regrets.

1025
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:27,570
Is this the companionship they write about in books?

1026
01:54:30,530 --> 01:54:31,570
I'll go pick mushrooms.

1027
01:54:31,650 --> 01:54:35,450
We'll have mushroom stew tonight, you like that.

1028
01:54:35,530 --> 01:54:36,910
I'll go with you.

1029
01:54:37,870 --> 01:54:38,700
I'll be quick.

1030
01:54:38,780 --> 01:54:39,790
Before it rains.

1031
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:55,760
What's with her?

1032
01:55:04,230 --> 01:55:05,770
Men are disgusting.

1033
01:55:06,270 --> 01:55:09,150
How can they be so single-minded?

1034
01:55:09,730 --> 01:55:10,900
What's on my mind?

1035
01:55:12,190 --> 01:55:15,450
You don't really believe that I crave your body, do you?

1036
01:55:17,570 --> 01:55:18,700
You do!

1037
01:55:18,780 --> 01:55:20,410
You read too many of those books.

1038
01:55:20,490 --> 01:55:22,290
If there's one thing I'm after, Miss...

1039
01:55:23,540 --> 01:55:28,540
It's not your eyes, your hands or ass,

1040
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:31,500
it's your money, only that.

1041
01:55:32,050 --> 01:55:34,090
Of all that you have, money is the best.

1042
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:39,720
It feels great being so rude to a noble lady.

1043
01:55:40,470 --> 01:55:42,060
What's with her?

1044
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:46,560
Why does she stomp her feet, expressing her anger,

1045
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:49,440
sit up in the middle of the night and sigh?

1046
01:55:51,230 --> 01:55:55,320
Every time she sees the Count, her eyes seem to say,

1047
01:55:56,110 --> 01:55:57,360
I despise you.

1048
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:00,160
Try to bear it.

1049
01:56:00,240 --> 01:56:03,450
Only if she sees this will she believe the proposal.

1050
01:56:23,060 --> 01:56:27,100
Think of me as that puppet, and I'll imagine another woman.

1051
01:56:27,560 --> 01:56:29,600
What woman?

1052
01:56:32,190 --> 01:56:33,610
The duchess Juliette.

1053
01:56:36,570 --> 01:56:38,240
Lady!

1054
01:56:38,990 --> 01:56:40,490
Milord!

1055
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:47,540
Lady...

1056
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:56,550
"The lady's emotions lay deep inside...

1057
01:56:57,170 --> 01:56:59,680
Jinlian could not fathom their depths.

1058
01:57:01,720 --> 01:57:03,800
Knowing this, Lady Sun

1059
01:57:03,890 --> 01:57:08,020
gave Jinlian four small silver balls.

1060
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:12,600
These are 'minling', or 'bells of passion'.

1061
01:57:12,690 --> 01:57:16,070
Place two in the lady's Jade Gate,

1062
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:19,700
and the other two in yours.

1063
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:24,200
Spread your legs apart

1064
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:26,790
and like two scissors

1065
01:57:26,870 --> 01:57:29,000
trying to cut each other, put them together.

1066
01:57:29,370 --> 01:57:32,170
When the lips below rub against each another,

1067
01:57:32,250 --> 01:57:34,290
you'll hear a clear ringing sound."

1068
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:36,500
A blackout! Bring a lantern!

1069
01:57:36,590 --> 01:57:38,130
Yes, sir!

1070
01:57:38,210 --> 01:57:41,340
THE SOUND OF BELLS ON A WINDLESS NIGHT

1071
01:57:43,180 --> 01:57:47,390
"'When do I put this in?'
asked Jinlian.

1072
01:57:48,220 --> 01:57:52,690
Does the lady breathe deeply and swallow hard?

1073
01:57:54,100 --> 01:57:57,230
Does she whisper sweetly in your ear,

1074
01:57:57,320 --> 01:57:59,190
and kiss you?

1075
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:06,240
Does she embrace you tightly

1076
01:58:06,330 --> 01:58:08,240
and caress your nipples?

1077
01:58:10,660 --> 01:58:15,210
Does her secret part become slippery

1078
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:23,130
as she gently bites your shoulder?

1079
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:27,850
Then, put in the bells."

1080
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:34,980
- Amazing!
- Indeed!

1081
01:58:54,250 --> 01:58:56,080
It's so cute.

1082
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:03,470
If the Count sees this...

1083
01:59:10,890 --> 01:59:13,270
Will he really be as tender as this?

1084
01:59:14,770 --> 01:59:16,020
Of course.

1085
01:59:16,100 --> 01:59:19,020
And he'll touch you like this...

1086
01:59:20,020 --> 01:59:21,150
And like this...

1087
01:59:29,910 --> 01:59:31,700
Tamako, keep doing

1088
01:59:32,790 --> 01:59:34,410
what the Count will.

1089
01:59:37,170 --> 01:59:38,330
The Count...

1090
01:59:38,830 --> 01:59:40,630
The Count...

1091
01:59:40,710 --> 01:59:43,300
He'll go crazy over this.

1092
01:59:45,630 --> 01:59:49,090
And this is what he'll say.

1093
01:59:51,350 --> 01:59:57,100
"It's so soft, warm, wet, and...

1094
02:00:01,110 --> 02:00:05,240
s... s... spellbindingly beautiful!"

1095
02:00:37,140 --> 02:00:40,060
Shall I teach you more, Miss?

1096
02:00:40,150 --> 02:00:42,520
Yes...

1097
02:00:43,110 --> 02:00:44,570
Teach me everything.

1098
02:01:29,530 --> 02:01:33,870
I wish that I had breast milk so I could feed you.

1099
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:50,590
Do you like it when I do this?

1100
02:01:52,260 --> 02:01:53,590
Do you like me?

1101
02:01:55,510 --> 02:01:58,270
Can you promise that you won't betray me?

1102
02:01:59,930 --> 02:02:01,850
I'll never...

1103
02:02:01,940 --> 02:02:02,850
never...

1104
02:02:04,230 --> 02:02:05,230
ever...

1105
02:02:19,750 --> 02:02:25,750
Miss, how could such an innocent...

1106
02:02:26,170 --> 02:02:27,880
You must be a natural.

1107
02:03:24,020 --> 02:03:24,850
Stop!

1108
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:30,150
I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

1109
02:03:30,980 --> 02:03:32,650
She's got no one on this earth.

1110
02:03:32,730 --> 02:03:36,070
If you frighten her, she'll close up hard as a clam.

1111
02:03:36,150 --> 02:03:37,700
And please...

1112
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:43,120
Don't ever again put my hand on your tiny joke of a cock.

1113
02:03:50,210 --> 02:03:51,210
You see?

1114
02:03:52,840 --> 02:03:55,510
If you don't give the impression you want this marriage,

1115
02:03:55,590 --> 02:03:58,840
she may throw another fit and refuse to go forward.

1116
02:03:58,930 --> 02:04:02,060
Be more convincing when you pretend to love me.

1117
02:04:02,140 --> 02:04:03,220
I can't do it.

1118
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:04,430
What?

1119
02:04:05,180 --> 02:04:06,520
I want to quit.

1120
02:04:08,690 --> 02:04:09,860
What's with you all today?

1121
02:04:11,570 --> 02:04:12,480
Why?

1122
02:04:13,610 --> 02:04:15,610
I hate everyone.
My mom, dad, aunt, uncle,

1123
02:04:15,690 --> 02:04:16,950
you and...

1124
02:04:22,830 --> 02:04:24,330
I don't like Sookee, either.

1125
02:04:24,410 --> 02:04:26,000
You feel sorry for her?

1126
02:04:29,370 --> 02:04:31,380
What is it with women?

1127
02:04:34,590 --> 02:04:38,180
You know what that poor Sookee said about your Ladyship?

1128
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:42,350
That you're too naive to get it even if someone pulls on your nipples.

1129
02:04:42,430 --> 02:04:45,350
That she was nice out of pity, but you ate it up.

1130
02:04:45,430 --> 02:04:47,140
That you were so gullible!

1131
02:04:47,230 --> 02:04:50,850
That naive servant's face...

1132
02:04:50,940 --> 02:04:53,270
Yes... you will love him.

1133
02:04:53,360 --> 02:04:56,400
If I say that I love someone else...

1134
02:04:57,820 --> 02:05:02,160
I have no one on this earth...

1135
02:05:02,740 --> 02:05:05,160
Would you still want me to marry him?

1136
02:05:05,580 --> 02:05:06,410
Yes.

1137
02:05:18,220 --> 02:05:19,130
Miss!

1138
02:05:41,910 --> 02:05:44,410
I wish I'd never been born.

1139
02:06:16,730 --> 02:06:19,940
I wish I'd never been born.

1140
02:06:39,880 --> 02:06:40,880
Let go.

1141
02:06:43,630 --> 02:06:46,680
Miss, I'm sorry!

1142
02:06:49,310 --> 02:06:50,140
Let go!

1143
02:06:50,810 --> 02:06:52,730
I'm sorry, Miss!

1144
02:06:53,100 --> 02:06:54,600
Don't die.

1145
02:06:54,690 --> 02:06:56,900
I'm sorry.

1146
02:06:58,860 --> 02:07:00,190
What are you sorry about?

1147
02:07:02,190 --> 02:07:06,780
I tried to trick you into marrying that bastard.

1148
02:07:06,870 --> 02:07:09,910
I was going to put you in a madhouse and run off.

1149
02:07:11,330 --> 02:07:15,250
Don't die. Don't get married, Miss!

1150
02:07:17,540 --> 02:07:21,000
Sookee, are you worried about me?

1151
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:28,260
I'm worried about you.

1152
02:07:33,730 --> 02:07:36,390
How do you know my name?

1153
02:07:37,850 --> 02:07:39,980
You think you're tricking me?

1154
02:07:42,610 --> 02:07:43,990
You're the one being tricked.

1155
02:07:45,650 --> 02:07:47,860
You're the one bound for the madhouse.

1156
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:52,540
I was going to lock you up in there under my name,

1157
02:07:53,290 --> 02:07:56,160
then I'd become you and run far away with him.

1158
02:08:01,250 --> 02:08:04,710
I won't say sorry, since you tried to trick me too.

1159
02:08:12,010 --> 02:08:14,520
That fucking son of a bitch!

1160
02:08:16,980 --> 02:08:19,980
Oh, sorry Miss!

1161
02:08:20,900 --> 02:08:25,150
"I hope this letter finds you well.
This is Sookee.

1162
02:08:25,610 --> 02:08:30,070
I'm writing to inform you of a change in plans.

1163
02:08:30,160 --> 02:08:35,370
I decided to team up with the Lady Hideko.

1164
02:08:35,450 --> 02:08:38,750
As such, I'm now in need of all your help.

1165
02:08:38,830 --> 02:08:41,840
I'm enclosing an item as advance payment."

1166
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:46,300
Always remember the basement.

1167
02:09:00,650 --> 02:09:02,610
Do you want to go somewhere nice?

1168
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:48,820
You didn't teach me to read Japanese.

1169
02:10:11,380 --> 02:10:13,340
Did that bastard draw this?

1170
02:10:15,850 --> 02:10:20,810
Is this what you've been reading to that dirty old man

1171
02:10:21,310 --> 02:10:22,690
and those gentlemen?

1172
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:32,570
The daughter of a legendary thief,

1173
02:12:32,650 --> 02:12:34,860
who sewed winter coats out of stolen purses,

1174
02:12:34,940 --> 02:12:38,110
who was a thief, pickpocket and swindler.

1175
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:41,780
She is the savior who came to tear my life apart.

1176
02:12:42,410 --> 02:12:43,910
My Tamako.

1177
02:12:44,790 --> 02:12:45,790
My Sookee.

1178
02:14:07,410 --> 02:14:09,330
How cruel can you be?

1179
02:14:09,410 --> 02:14:12,670
You plucked the flower, now re-plant it.

1180
02:14:12,750 --> 02:14:14,750
What do you want?

1181
02:14:14,830 --> 02:14:17,960
Hurry up and throw her into the madhouse!

1182
02:14:23,430 --> 02:14:24,930
You scoundrel!

1183
02:14:25,430 --> 02:14:27,680
Let go of me, you filthy bitches!

1184
02:14:29,220 --> 02:14:30,640
Miss!

1185
02:14:31,140 --> 02:14:32,640
Let go!

1186
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:35,770
Miss!

1187
02:14:50,910 --> 02:14:51,910
I'm hungry.

1188
02:14:56,580 --> 02:15:01,130
The first month, I ordered a slim herringbone suit.

1189
02:15:01,890 --> 02:15:04,880
The next month, I wore it to dine at the Imperial Hotel.

1190
02:15:02,220 --> 02:15:05,740
PART THREE

1191
02:15:06,030 --> 02:15:08,810
Me, a colonial boy working as a tout at a brothel.

1192
02:15:08,890 --> 02:15:11,970
Some Englishmen who frequented the brothel recognized me.

1193
02:15:12,060 --> 02:15:15,650
I thought they'd call the maitre d' and kick me out,

1194
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:17,440
but what do you know?

1195
02:15:18,400 --> 02:15:22,780
They were amused I'd spend a month's pay

1196
02:15:22,860 --> 02:15:24,320
on one dignified meal.

1197
02:15:25,450 --> 02:15:27,740
They started calling me "Count"

1198
02:15:27,820 --> 02:15:29,660
and taught me manners to go with the name.

1199
02:15:29,740 --> 02:15:31,740
Frankly, I'm not that interested in money itself.

1200
02:15:32,330 --> 02:15:34,580
What I desire is, how shall I put it...

1201
02:15:35,750 --> 02:15:38,250
The manner of ordering wine without looking at the price?

1202
02:15:38,710 --> 02:15:39,920
Something like that.

1203
02:15:51,930 --> 02:15:54,430
Fourteen hours by train from Vladivostok

1204
02:15:54,520 --> 02:15:56,520
is the summer home of a genuine Russian noble family.

1205
02:15:56,600 --> 02:15:58,480
All the furniture is set

1206
02:15:58,560 --> 02:16:00,940
along with ankle-deep carpets.

1207
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:09,700
Shall we marry there?

1208
02:16:15,160 --> 02:16:17,420
In a few days, I'll hear from the hospital.

1209
02:16:19,330 --> 02:16:22,000
That my wife Fujiwara Hideko has died.

1210
02:16:26,050 --> 02:16:28,680
You didn't just ask them to keep her?

1211
02:16:29,590 --> 02:16:32,890
I doubt Sookee would want to live there very long.

1212
02:16:41,610 --> 02:16:42,650
Fuck!

1213
02:16:47,610 --> 02:16:49,240
Bastard.

1214
02:16:49,320 --> 02:16:52,740
I never said I wasn't a bastard.

1215
02:16:54,370 --> 02:16:58,620
You'll become a colonial girl named Nam Sookee.

1216
02:16:58,710 --> 02:17:00,670
You know I'm an expert at document forgery, right?

1217
02:17:00,750 --> 02:17:02,710
I arranged it with a photography studio.

1218
02:17:03,960 --> 02:17:07,720
From tomorrow, we'll give Sookee a new life.

1219
02:17:07,800 --> 02:17:09,090
I'm glad.

1220
02:17:09,180 --> 02:17:10,840
Marry me once again.

1221
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:13,430
This time as Nam Sookee.

1222
02:17:15,430 --> 02:17:17,350
You want another wedding night?

1223
02:17:23,770 --> 02:17:26,900
I think I slightly like you.

1224
02:17:30,400 --> 02:17:32,660
Poor Sookee, in a place like that

1225
02:17:33,950 --> 02:17:35,790
all by herself...

1226
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:41,080
Did such a thought ever cross your mind?

1227
02:17:41,540 --> 02:17:43,670
Not at all. Why should I pity her?

1228
02:17:44,170 --> 02:17:46,710
Where I come from, it's illegal to be naive.

1229
02:17:47,460 --> 02:17:50,970
Where you come from,
it's not naive to fall in love with a business partner?

1230
02:17:51,050 --> 02:17:53,140
Of course. It's illegal.

1231
02:17:53,640 --> 02:17:56,970
So even if my love for you leads me to ruin,

1232
02:17:57,560 --> 02:17:58,980
don't pity me.

1233
02:17:59,770 --> 02:18:00,600
Love?

1234
02:18:02,900 --> 02:18:04,690
What does a crook know about love?

1235
02:18:27,550 --> 02:18:30,090
Fire!

1236
02:18:39,680 --> 02:18:42,020
C... c... come this way!

1237
02:18:42,100 --> 02:18:44,480
This way!

1238
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:56,590
Because you desired me,

1239
02:19:56,680 --> 02:19:58,930
and overcame all obstacles to reach me,

1240
02:19:59,010 --> 02:20:00,970
I have been born anew, it's true.

1241
02:20:02,560 --> 02:20:04,230
I'm grateful for that.

1242
02:20:06,600 --> 02:20:08,480
I'll allow a kiss.

1243
02:20:13,570 --> 02:20:14,400
No.

1244
02:20:14,820 --> 02:20:15,650
Why not?

1245
02:20:19,030 --> 02:20:21,080
I don't like kisses with conditions.

1246
02:20:21,160 --> 02:20:23,790
I never learned how to stop halfway.

1247
02:20:26,040 --> 02:20:31,380
After this I'll thrust in deep, to your navel.

1248
02:20:32,460 --> 02:20:33,960
Please do that.

1249
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:39,220
Those aren't the eyes of one who wants it.

1250
02:20:39,800 --> 02:20:42,430
You know you can't deceive me in such matters.

1251
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:51,690
If I could be yours for ten minutes,

1252
02:20:51,770 --> 02:20:53,020
what would you give in exchange?

1253
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:56,690
Whatever your heart desires.

1254
02:20:56,780 --> 02:20:59,070
Anything in this whole wide world.

1255
02:21:23,930 --> 02:21:25,560
There's much I want to teach you.

1256
02:21:27,560 --> 02:21:30,310
You'll become a completely new woman.

1257
02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:24,840
It won't hurt.
You've seen it in those books.

1258
02:23:24,930 --> 02:23:28,760
In truth, women feel the greatest pleasure

1259
02:23:28,850 --> 02:23:30,510
when taken by force.

1260
02:23:31,060 --> 02:23:33,850
Now I'm going to rip your underwear.

1261
02:25:51,950 --> 02:25:54,070
Would you fetch those for me?

1262
02:26:04,080 --> 02:26:07,000
Okay, here we go.

1263
02:26:07,090 --> 02:26:09,010
One, two, three.

1264
02:26:50,510 --> 02:26:52,470
Respected Uncle,

1265
02:26:53,550 --> 02:26:55,390
it always pained me

1266
02:26:55,840 --> 02:26:58,560
to see you straining to speak flawless Japanese

1267
02:26:58,640 --> 02:27:03,190
before the Count from Nagoya and even to quiver your voice

1268
02:27:03,270 --> 02:27:06,360
like a nobleman.

1269
02:27:08,690 --> 02:27:14,740
So I'm happy to inform you that you no longer need do so.

1270
02:27:15,910 --> 02:27:20,540
That man is the son of a Korean farmhand.

1271
02:27:21,540 --> 02:27:25,870
Oh, did my gift arrive safely?

1272
02:27:26,960 --> 02:27:30,590
Please tell this to my gift, in Korean.

1273
02:27:31,510 --> 02:27:33,260
I'm afraid that in real life,

1274
02:27:34,340 --> 02:27:37,640
no woman feels pleasure at being taken by force.

1275
02:27:38,050 --> 02:27:43,520
But, for sending me Sookee out of all the girls in the world,

1276
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:45,730
I feel "slightly" grateful.

1277
02:27:59,320 --> 02:28:02,660
You wished to see my bookmaking tools?

1278
02:28:03,290 --> 02:28:06,580
Don't just look, experience them for yourself.

1279
02:28:07,580 --> 02:28:09,380
I'll choose five books that I cherish...

1280
02:28:10,090 --> 02:28:12,710
that I used to cherish more than anything.

1281
02:28:15,010 --> 02:28:17,180
Let's see... First,

1282
02:28:20,260 --> 02:28:22,350
Confessions of a Whip

1283
02:28:31,150 --> 02:28:32,440
The Lizard Skin

1284
02:28:44,950 --> 02:28:48,620
Decadent Girls Who Sell Lingerie

1285
02:28:57,970 --> 02:29:00,680
May I please smoke a cigarette, sir?

1286
02:29:01,760 --> 02:29:02,600
Sir.

1287
02:29:05,770 --> 02:29:06,980
Bells and Balls

1288
02:29:11,310 --> 02:29:12,940
The Mortician's Bedroom

1289
02:29:25,450 --> 02:29:28,080
How could you let a little girl fool you?

1290
02:29:31,460 --> 02:29:35,960
But don't worry.
I'll catch them for you soon.

1291
02:29:41,340 --> 02:29:44,100
I'll bind books with the skin of those two bitches and you

1292
02:29:44,180 --> 02:29:48,230
and place them on the shelf.

1293
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:54,860
I arranged so that no two girls traveling together can leave Kobe.

1294
02:29:57,690 --> 02:29:59,860
Please change the destination to Shanghai.

1295
02:30:00,280 --> 02:30:03,370
Changing two tickets, from Vladivostok to Shanghai.

1296
02:30:03,450 --> 02:30:05,200
Yes, that's correct.

1297
02:30:05,990 --> 02:30:06,950
Show me your passports.

1298
02:30:14,670 --> 02:30:16,130
Miss Nam Sookee?

1299
02:30:19,550 --> 02:30:20,760
Mr. Go Pan-dol?

1300
02:30:29,390 --> 02:30:31,850
You need to pay an additional 3 yen.

1301
02:30:32,480 --> 02:30:33,310
All right.

1302
02:30:37,980 --> 02:30:43,070
Hideko is a peach that I left on the branch,

1303
02:30:43,740 --> 02:30:46,160
imagining what the taste will be like.

1304
02:30:46,950 --> 02:30:49,830
Would I have plucked it someday?

1305
02:30:50,500 --> 02:30:51,330
No.

1306
02:30:52,620 --> 02:30:57,000
I'm just an old man who likes dirty stories.

1307
02:30:58,880 --> 02:31:02,010
Even listening to the same story, people imagine different things.

1308
02:31:03,010 --> 02:31:06,010
Peering into each of those fantasies

1309
02:31:06,550 --> 02:31:09,510
was this old man's humble recreation.

1310
02:31:10,020 --> 02:31:13,100
What to do, now that it's all over?

1311
02:31:13,770 --> 02:31:16,150
You should at least tell me your story.

1312
02:31:17,980 --> 02:31:21,190
How did that bitch Hideko taste?

1313
02:31:22,280 --> 02:31:25,240
Was she fully ripe?
Tell me.

1314
02:31:28,240 --> 02:31:30,620
A cigarette might help my memory.

1315
02:31:31,790 --> 02:31:34,040
Right, right...

1316
02:31:34,830 --> 02:31:38,590
You have that silly penchant for cigarettes?

1317
02:31:55,600 --> 02:31:59,310
So how was Hideko?

1318
02:32:05,610 --> 02:32:09,410
You have no windows here.

1319
02:32:13,160 --> 02:32:16,160
Sookee could be listening in.
Let's do our best.

1320
02:32:28,260 --> 02:32:29,510
That's it, good.

1321
02:32:42,020 --> 02:32:43,730
What's this?

1322
02:32:43,820 --> 02:32:46,190
You can't stop there, dear fellow.

1323
02:32:46,280 --> 02:32:48,610
So, where did you touch first?

1324
02:32:49,070 --> 02:32:49,910
Her face?

1325
02:32:52,700 --> 02:32:54,080
Her breasts?

1326
02:32:55,700 --> 02:32:57,710
Or straight for her c... cunt?

1327
02:33:00,210 --> 02:33:01,630
Was it soft?

1328
02:33:02,500 --> 02:33:04,050
Did it tighten up?

1329
02:33:05,710 --> 02:33:07,550
Did it have many wrinkles?

1330
02:33:08,550 --> 02:33:10,720
Was it sufficiently wet?

1331
02:33:10,800 --> 02:33:14,310
How was the viscosity and transparency of her vaginal secretion?

1332
02:33:15,770 --> 02:33:17,890
Please, one more cigarette, sir.

1333
02:33:44,880 --> 02:33:52,050
Spider thread pulled into strings...

1334
02:33:52,140 --> 02:33:55,890
I dare say no book has ever described

1335
02:33:55,970 --> 02:33:58,980
such a ferocious wedding night.

1336
02:34:03,480 --> 02:34:07,110
I thought I heard a nightingale sing.

1337
02:34:41,940 --> 02:34:46,940
And the clear, bright crimson blood...

1338
02:34:56,070 --> 02:34:58,290
Thus the Lady became my wife.

1339
02:34:58,870 --> 02:35:02,830
Coy one moment, bold the next...

1340
02:35:06,500 --> 02:35:10,760
But how was she coy,

1341
02:35:11,340 --> 02:35:15,510
how was she bold, tell it to me in detail!

1342
02:35:16,010 --> 02:35:19,390
A story is all about the journey.

1343
02:35:19,470 --> 02:35:21,180
You should know.

1344
02:35:23,310 --> 02:35:24,850
Did she resist?

1345
02:35:25,980 --> 02:35:28,360
So did you pinch her ass as punishment?

1346
02:35:28,820 --> 02:35:32,490
Or did she spit at you in contempt?

1347
02:35:33,610 --> 02:35:35,030
Or else...

1348
02:35:35,660 --> 02:35:37,820
Did she beg you to do it?

1349
02:35:38,870 --> 02:35:42,250
Like the lady in The Widow's Lapdog ?

1350
02:35:45,790 --> 02:35:47,040
How dare you!

1351
02:35:47,460 --> 02:35:49,090
Hideko is my wife.

1352
02:35:49,670 --> 02:35:53,970
What kind of scoundrel rattles on about his wedding night!

1353
02:37:30,230 --> 02:37:31,770
It's odd...

1354
02:37:33,190 --> 02:37:34,980
Your smoke.

1355
02:37:37,490 --> 02:37:40,910
It's cold, blue...

1356
02:37:42,370 --> 02:37:48,040
and strangely beautiful.

1357
02:37:49,580 --> 02:37:56,210
You too have become soft, slow and dull.

1358
02:37:57,960 --> 02:38:00,930
Mercury is most deadly in its gaseous state.

1359
02:38:01,930 --> 02:38:03,760
One cigarette would have sufficed.

1360
02:38:07,970 --> 02:38:12,270
At least I will die with my cock intact.
