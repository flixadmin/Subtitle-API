1
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,480
'O birds, you are all over this world'

2
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,470
'You have spread your wings
right up to Heaven'

3
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,990
'Our earth and our skies
abound in these birds'

4
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,430
'Feathered creatures of our world!'

5
00:06:44,826 --> 00:06:48,162
I just read his latest paper
He's working on this new type of robot

6
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:50,503
Looks like heavy security
There's an auto drone

7
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,601
Shall we ask him questions?

8
00:06:52,601 --> 00:06:54,206
Ask sensible questions please

9
00:06:54,254 --> 00:06:56,991
Any idea what to ask
One look at him and-

10
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,494
'Welcome'

11
00:07:04,572 --> 00:07:06,100
We are from Excel Engineering college

12
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,473
Robotic research students

13
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,820
We've got an appointment
to meet Dr Vaseegaran

14
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,900
Please come in

15
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,840
Dude, soooper hyperbola!

16
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,340
Excuse me
You are-

17
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,600
I am Dr Vaseegaran's assistant

18
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,610
- Your name
- Nila

19
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,630
- Beauuuutiful!
- Thanks

20
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,770
Nila...moon!

21
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:26,890
What?

22
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,030
It's a lie to say
there's no gravity in the moon

23
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,570
- Why?
- You are such a magnetic force!

24
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,340
Your laughter can be my ringtone!

25
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:33,860
Can I have your number?

26
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,150
11423879

27
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,940
Enough! The whole floor is slippery!

28
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
Hi

29
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,750
Hello, sir

30
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,270
Please sit down

31
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,050
Doctor, we are mechatronic students

32
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:54,360
Professor Mithra told us you have
created a new humanoid robot

33
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,620
- Can we take a look at that?
- Sure

34
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,680
This is the new robot I have created

35
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,930
Project Nila

36
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,830
Nice, intelligent, lovely assistant

37
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,490
Humanoid X12 2018 model

38
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,020
Quantum Core Millenia

39
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,830
X12 5D Extreme processor

40
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,320
Unlimited Cloud memory

41
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,570
1 Tera hertz speed

42
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,830
Built in simulated Amygdala

43
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,050
This is her MPU
Memory and Power Unit

44
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,540
Works like our heart

45
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,950
Synthetic skin

46
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,530
Ultra realistic humanoid

47
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,920
You are such a magnetic force!

48
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,470
What about that phone #?

49
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,080
That's my IMEI #

50
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,780
- Is she also like Chitti, doctor?
- No

51
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,130
Created adhering to Asimov's laws
this is a domestic purpose robot

52
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,750
You can treat her as your friend,
secretary and caretaker

53
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,610
She will be of help to mankind
in all ways and always

54
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,590
Does it have feelings, doctor?

55
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,410
Yes, pre programmed,
customizable, controlled feelings

56
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,920
Is there any chance for Chitti
to resurface again, doctor?

57
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,660
All our present scientific inventions
in the beginning were opposed as dangerous

58
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,180
And labelled as null and void

59
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,600
Bound by time

60
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,730
It became a necessity
in the ensuing years

61
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,250
Chitti will also be a pre requisite one day

62
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,420
Dot!

63
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,860
- Hey Nikita
- Go to hell!

64
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,830
Bulb! You got what you deserved

65
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,720
Nikita, hear me out

66
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,700
I acted as if I was flirting with her
just to make you see red

67
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,160
- As if I didn't know she's a robot?
- 'Get lost, liar!'

68
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,130
My Barbie doll
My Snow White princess!

69
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,380
'Shut up and hang up!'

70
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,690
Believe me, I've booked
an Apple watch for your birthday

71
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,320
Sushma, Moksha has got
a new Collection today

72
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,410
You eat and then I'll come over, okay?

73
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,270
My flight was delayed
Inform the clients, I'll be there by-

74
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,160
When I get back from work
I chat with my family nonstop!

75
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,970
We spend quality time you know

76
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,470
You bloody swine!

77
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,050
Harith, can I have my phone?

78
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,510
Daddy has to make an important call

79
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,200
Give me the phone

80
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,070
Don't cry...here

81
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,400
I didn't do anything

82
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,950
What is the bid today
in our chit fund?

83
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,080
Can get Rs 3000

84
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,010
What is this?

85
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,260
Make 'Dhal Rice' and potato curry
for dinner, enough

86
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,080
Grandpa!

87
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,190
'Residing in all of that as Me'

88
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,220
'So that Me through this Me'

89
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,380
'Talking to Me'

90
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,620
Dude, this must be
our principal's handiwork!

91
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,270
Where are you, dear?

92
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,870
Coming to the terrace?

93
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,840
What happened?

94
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,540
Our project manager and
prickly 'Jackfruit' Asha

95
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,190
...are hand and glove in this

96
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,370
That's why he promoted her
and sent her on site

97
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,040
He went to get the bore-well man
No sign of him still

98
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,590
Tomorrow is Mahavir Jayanthi
All the shops will be closed

99
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,280
Buy our stuff tonight, okay?

100
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,350
This phone has 4G, Wifi, Bluetooth
plus dual Sim capacity

101
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:38,040
I came to see girls but here,
men all around

102
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,300
Danger
Girlfriend calling

103
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,860
- Hi Sana
- 'Hi scientist sir'

104
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,720
'Wonder of wonders
You picked my call?'

105
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,450
- Sorry, Sana
- 'How many calls?'

106
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,820
'Can't you even pick my call?
Are you that busy?'

107
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,450
'Just for your sake I'm 10,000 km away
and studying here like a lunatic'

108
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,990
'Under the pretext of working on
your project, are you flirting with Nila?'

109
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,290
That's a robot, Sana

110
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,700
'But a female doll, right?'

111
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,060
Don't be mad at me, honey

112
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,840
'I called you 112 times!'

113
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,580
I'll accept your punishment
and kiss you 112 times

114
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,950
'No need 112'

115
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,960
'Just 1 phone-kiss, let me see'

116
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,220
Mua-

117
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,440
Flying kiss?!

118
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,450
Sir, where should I complain
to retrieve my mobile?

119
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,230
All of them are waiting too!
Go and stand in the queue

120
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,810
How can a cell phone fly?
And where will it go?

121
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,100
Who is behind all this?
What is the reason?

122
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,040
'Is a whole gang behind this
or just an individual?'

123
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,140
'This is scary'

124
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,800
Is this a sign our world
will perish as people claim?

125
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,810
Like the ozone hole there is
a black hole in the sky it seems

126
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,470
It has sucked all the phones I believe

127
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,670
Hey! What you talking

128
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,610
You're talking as if it's a drainage hole

129
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,390
I'm in the share market
My job is dependent on cell phones

130
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,780
Life is absolutely boring
without WhatsApp and selfies

131
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,350
As soon as I wake up
I take my mobile to the loo

132
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,040
I feel I've lost my hand now!

133
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,660
My husband is working in Qatar

134
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,070
Our long distance romance
is only through cell phone

135
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:19,830
I've saved my mom's # as 'Amma'
I don't even know her landline # now

136
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,050
I've stored my bank account #,
ATM pin #, password, the whole works

137
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:27,230
It has personal videos and photos
of my girlfriend and me

138
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,210
What if they are uploaded
on an adult site?

139
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,860
Excuse me, is there a separate section
for iPhone?

140
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,780
For sure! It has been opened
near pagal khana, go there

141
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,080
Sir, I'm very sentimental
about this cell phone

142
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,450
Do something, sir

143
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,140
How can I take this as a complaint?

144
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,200
- Get lost!
- Sir, please

145
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,460
I had hooked my wedding chain
on my mobile, sir

146
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,790
I lost that too

147
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,360
10 sovereign
Pure gold, sir

148
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,100
No wife to nag, no phone bills
to pay, why don't you relax?

149
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,840
God will be appeased if you do
a redemption ritual in Thirunallar, sir

150
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,380
You and your silly superstitions!

151
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,390
Commissioner sir asked me to meet you

152
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,680
I'll take care, sir

153
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,130
Thank you

154
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,700
Telecom minister is on the line

155
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,330
Sir, even our chief minister
has lost his mobile

156
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,940
He is on another line

157
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,920
Your secretary is right here
I'll handle it, sir

158
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,820
Sir, minister's phone-

159
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,520
I've embedded precious stones all over

160
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,730

162
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,320
it costs 2crore, sir

163
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,970
Somehow retrieve it for us, sir

164
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,090

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,850
I heard you're tracking with Sim card

168
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,920
- What happened, sir?
- It isn't our BSNL network alone

169
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,630
All the other networks too
are unable to track even 1 phone, sir

170
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,890
All the cell phones
have been switched off

171
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,240
Every single phone in the city is missing

172
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,330
How can all of them
be switched off?

173
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,740
How is it even possible

174
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,560

179
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,040
What is this?

180
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,410
What is this phenomenon?

181
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,940
This is strange

182
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,290
I've checked all the NASA studies
and Interpol records

183
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,120
No one has recorded such an event
anywhere in the world

184
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,780
There is no scientific explanation
so far for this rare occurrence

185
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,320
It is so obvious

186
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,580
This is a terrorist attack

187
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,630
They are planning something large-scale

188
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,440
If we can't come up with a reason

189
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,310
...it's our habit to blame
either God or terrorists, right?

190
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,180
Can it be the handiwork of aliens
from a different planet maybe?

191
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,190
No, sir

192
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,640
According to ISRO reports

193
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,540
...no new movements or alien activities
have been recorded in space

194
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:41,140
Can it be a conspiracy by some
international company in the same field?

195
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,080
I mean, wipe out the present
telephone technology

196
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,170
And bring in a new
scientific know-how

197
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,590
This is a public display

198
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,700
As far as i know, all the mobiles in the city
flying in mid air like sparrows

199
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,470
There isn't any technology
like this nowhere in the world

200
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,030
May be someone we know here
who botched up a lousy robot earlier

201
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,380
Some crank scientist

202
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,570
...is messing up with some other invention
in the name of novelty, who knows!

203
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,240
Who is this?

204
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,820
Late Mr Bohra
AIRD director

205
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,870
His son
Dhinendra Bohra

206
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,260
Scientist, he's also a director in AIRD

207
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,540
On the day all the cell phones went missing

208
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,850
...data from INSAT 3D weather satellite

209
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,660
And GSAT 16 communication satellite

210
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,350
This is the visualization of
combined data

211
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,590
All these dots are cell phones

212
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,490
After a certain distance
the dots vanish into thin air

213
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,060
Cell phones haven't crossed
the troposphere

214
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,330
That is, not crossed
10 km above sea level

215
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,870
If you take the distance into account

216
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,490
...not crossed a radius
of 200 km beyond Chennai

217
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,960
They are all missing
within this sphere somewhere

218
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,560
We are aware of only 4 forces

219
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,990
Gravity, electromagnetic,
strong nuclear, weak nuclear

220
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,940
These 4 won't attract mobile force

221
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,750
I believe this can be
explained scientifically

222
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,240
Dot!

223
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,180
I believe all the phones in this shop
broke the glass panes and flew out

224
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,190
When will the container lorry
reach here?

225
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,200
- 'Crossed Nagari'
- Doomed!

226
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,380
Not yet crossed Agra border?

227
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,160
We've announced
tomorrow's sale

228
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,500
No one has a cell phone in the city

229
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,650
They will make a beeline to our shop
like devotees in the Tirupati temple at 6am

230
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,310
'Don't worry, it will be
delivered at 4:00 a.m'

231
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,640
You've been saying this
like a broken record!

Songs nowadays are only like this!

00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,350
Bro...?!

236
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,780
Someone is digging
with a crowbar in our van

237
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,110
We have only cartons
with cell phones in there

238
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,020
Call me, as soon as
the truck reaches here

239
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,640
Have you asked
for police protection?

240
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,930
Paid them, the cops will
be here by tomorrow morning

241
00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:00,000
Okay. What if all the cell phones we get
for our sale tomorrow fly away?

242
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,660
It means we are jinxed
beyond redemption

243
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,690
Not only for us
For the entire city

Wha...what is that noise?

00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,920
'The container has arrived, sir'

249
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,950
Who is that?

250
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,160
'Mohanan, sir'

251
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,170
'You asked me to call you
as soon as the container arrives, right?'

252
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,590
- Where?
- 'To your house' sir.

253
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,940
Please cooperate

254
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,990
Go back

255
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:19,820
Hello Sir

256
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,440
- Commissioner Rajendran asked me to come
- Please come in

257
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,710
There is no evidence of human presence
in Jayanth Kumar's murder

258
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,840
As the deceased is a cell phone merchant

259
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,340
...he wanted you to check for clues

260
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,870
His family members are out of town

261
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:33,970
He was all alone

262
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,900
The servants are not aware of anything

263
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,920
No fingerprint or footprint in the room

264
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,130
He exploded into pieces

265
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,790
But there is no evidence
of explosives whatsoever

266
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:58,050
He had advertised in the papers
about his Mobile Sale in a big way

267
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,670
The container carrying the load
met with an accident yesterday night

268
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,730
The entire load went missing

269
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,020
Nothing makes sense, sir

270
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:09,170
Someone or something doesn't like
the presence of cell phones here

271
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:17,280
This is silicon, enamel and
polycarbonate dust from lots of mobiles

272
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,910
Different brands
manufactured on different dates

273
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,040
Will you believe me if I say
Jayanth Kumar was killed by cell phones?

274
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,810
A cell phone is an assassin?

275
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,990
What do you mean, sir?

276
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,720
All the missing cell phones
have landed here

277
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,670
How did these phones come here?

278
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,560
Where did they go?
We should find out

279
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,570
Dot!

280
00:25:05,699 --> 00:25:09,060
'What's the matter sir, what a surprise!
You've called of your own accord'

281
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,860
Sana, call getting connected is a big thing now.
this is the city's last phone

282
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,580
To trace the phones, I've fixed a tracker
in my old phone and I've activated it

283
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,261
'Oh! So am I the guinea pig?'

284
00:25:19,261 --> 00:25:22,861
Not like that, Sana, my phone flew away
before I could send my kisses!

285
00:25:22,941 --> 00:25:24,941
That's why, I thought
I'll do it today-

286
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,221
'After 3 days, huh?'

287
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,622
'What happened to your landline?
Why didn't you call from that #?'

288
00:25:29,622 --> 00:25:31,221
Phone was engaged, Sana

289
00:25:31,221 --> 00:25:32,382
'Don't lie'

290
00:25:32,382 --> 00:25:34,062
'Accept you don't remember my #'

00:25:34,101 --> 00:25:35,701
'Out of sight, out of mind!'

292
00:25:35,862 --> 00:25:37,302
'Now your whole world is Nila'

293
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:38,502
She's just like a laptop

294
00:25:38,502 --> 00:25:41,462
'You bet she's on your lap
and you're coddling her 24x7!'

295
00:25:41,662 --> 00:25:43,383
- 'A duet on top of all this!'
- Shut up!

296
00:25:43,423 --> 00:25:45,662
'If I speak the truth,
should I shut up?'

297
00:25:45,742 --> 00:25:46,902
Stop nagging me

298
00:25:46,983 --> 00:25:48,542
This phone may also fly away!

Activating EMR

304

What is happening?
Are they looking for a bomb?

305
00:26:42,907 --> 00:26:44,907
- You search that side
- Okay, boss

306
00:29:45,482 --> 00:29:46,442
Thanks, Nila

307
00:29:46,442 --> 00:29:47,921
Why thank a laptop?!

your issue inside, wait

00:30:07,003 --> 00:30:08,603
Sir, Onicel owner Manoj Lulla is coming

311

He's such a pain in the wrong place!

- Please sit down
- I don't need any pacifying

Does a Govt exist or not?

Look, Mr Lulla

319
00:30:24,644 --> 00:30:26,365
Govt and God are one and the same

320
00:30:26,405 --> 00:30:28,925
If you believe, they exist
If not, they don't

321
00:30:29,085 --> 00:30:31,524
But you ensure your palms
are greased promptly, eh?

322
00:30:32,805 --> 00:30:35,526
Without exception it has snatched
all my cell phone towers

323
00:30:35,565 --> 00:30:37,725
Destroyed all the microwave emitters

324
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,366
Not just yours, sir

325
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:42,525
Microwave emitters of all other
networks have been destroyed too

326
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:45,486
Uprooted the vendors' towers
they had rented as well

327
00:30:45,606 --> 00:30:48,086
Everyone is in a state of shock
You saw them, right?

328
00:30:48,086 --> 00:30:49,166
What should I see?

329
00:30:49,206 --> 00:30:50,647
My loss runs in millions

330
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,367
If this continues, in 3 months
I'll be in the streets

331
00:30:53,606 --> 00:30:55,526
We are watching
from all angles

332
00:30:55,726 --> 00:30:57,406
Not enough if you just watch

333
00:30:57,687 --> 00:31:01,126
We've paid through our nose for you
and your party during the election

334
00:31:01,287 --> 00:31:05,128
You should be standing out in the open
with your arms stretched like a tower

335
00:31:05,168 --> 00:31:06,687
Don't get tense

336
00:31:06,847 --> 00:31:08,528
This isn't your problem alone

337
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:10,968
Before hasn't something like this happened?

338
00:31:11,567 --> 00:31:14,088
We don't know how to manage this situation

339
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:17,128
in our cabinet meeting
we've requested military aid

340
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:21,049
To protect the towers we will use army

341
00:31:21,568 --> 00:31:25,368
Don't think you can appease me
like how you tackle the general public

342
00:31:25,449 --> 00:31:27,009
I give you 1 week grace time

343
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:29,290
By then things should
go back to normalcy

344
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:31,049
I must start my business again

345
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,609
Otherwise the next upload in Wiki Leaks...

346
00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:35,850
...will be yours!

347
00:31:43,451 --> 00:31:44,450
5th force

348
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:47,651
The scientific world is still into
extensive research about this force

349
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,851
The way it works
How to measure it

350
00:31:49,971 --> 00:31:51,331
Our knowledge is zilch

351
00:31:51,531 --> 00:31:55,091
This could be the evidence
for the existence of the 5th force

352
00:31:55,091 --> 00:31:58,531
We can't explain this force based
on our knowledge of science

353
00:31:58,611 --> 00:32:00,892
Using the amenities at our disposal

354
00:32:00,932 --> 00:32:02,612
...we can't combat it either

355
00:32:02,772 --> 00:32:05,132
That's why we've requested
our military to step in

356
00:32:05,211 --> 00:32:07,131
Sir, it's a huge force

357
00:32:07,172 --> 00:32:08,452
I saw it with my own eyes

358
00:32:08,533 --> 00:32:10,453
If you ask the military
to combat it

359
00:32:10,492 --> 00:32:12,373
...you will only face
enormous loss of life

360
00:32:12,412 --> 00:32:14,053
What should we do then?

361
00:32:14,293 --> 00:32:17,173
To combat it effectively
we need a super power

362
00:32:18,093 --> 00:32:20,254
We need exceptional intelligence

363
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,454
Extraordinary powerful force

364
00:32:22,454 --> 00:32:24,533
We need a man with
the boon of immortality

365
00:32:25,133 --> 00:32:26,613
A man who will never die?

366
00:32:27,413 --> 00:32:29,054
Does a person like that exist?

367
00:32:29,774 --> 00:32:31,014
Chitti

368
00:32:31,133 --> 00:32:32,213
The Robot!

369
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:39,736
We must get him from the museum

370
00:32:39,815 --> 00:32:40,815
Dot...!

371
00:32:42,015 --> 00:32:43,415
I'm waiting

372
00:32:43,535 --> 00:32:45,376
No...impossible

373
00:32:46,535 --> 00:32:48,136
It's illegal

374
00:32:48,336 --> 00:32:50,016
that robot is banned

375
00:32:50,096 --> 00:32:51,575
Has been dismantled too

376
00:32:52,416 --> 00:32:54,896
Have we forgotten how it went
out of control

377
00:32:55,135 --> 00:32:58,135
How many people lost their lives
Immense loss of property as well

378
00:32:58,135 --> 00:32:59,816
...if we bring it back

379
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:01,217
...it won't die

380
00:33:02,456 --> 00:33:04,017
It will massacre all of us

381
00:33:05,496 --> 00:33:09,176
Everyone is aware who was responsible
for that robot's drastic change

382
00:33:10,017 --> 00:33:12,618
This time I'll ensure
such a blunder does not occur

383
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,498
Sir, this is Mr Vaseegaran's conspiracy

384
00:33:16,257 --> 00:33:19,938
He wants to use this critical situation
and reactivate his invention

385
00:33:19,938 --> 00:33:22,858
He wants to make money by
selling it to multinational companies

386
00:33:22,938 --> 00:33:24,177
Now you decide

387
00:33:24,218 --> 00:33:26,618
Have we assembled here
to save the people?

388
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,538
Or for Vaseegaran's advertising?

389
00:33:28,818 --> 00:33:31,339
Okay, so you come up with a solution

390
00:33:33,099 --> 00:33:34,378
Let's...think about it

391
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:36,539
That's why we are here

392
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:42,260
Sir, my suggestion is based
purely on good intentions

393
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:43,980
This is the start
of an apocalypse

394
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,381
If we don't prevent it now, we'll be
wiped out en masse, only Chitti can save us

395
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,940
Mr Vaseegaran

396
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,740
We can't flout a court order blatantly

397
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,261
The process required
to do so is very tedious

398
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:58,500
I must pass an ordinance
in the Parliament

399
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:01,941
Opposition parties should cooperate

400
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:04,381
- Not possible
- It is possible, sir

401
00:34:04,381 --> 00:34:06,982
Have a minister seen a situation like this before?

402
00:34:07,022 --> 00:34:09,581
We can convince the court
by explaining in detail later

403
00:34:09,622 --> 00:34:10,622
Such a rule exists

404
00:34:10,662 --> 00:34:12,662
But if that robot kills some people?

405
00:34:13,022 --> 00:34:14,582
Who will take the responsibility?

406
00:34:14,663 --> 00:34:15,662
Mine?

407
00:34:15,702 --> 00:34:17,062
Or our minister?

408
00:34:18,462 --> 00:34:21,103
- Such a situation won't arise, sir
- Why not?

409
00:34:21,783 --> 00:34:23,342
That's a machine

410
00:34:23,502 --> 00:34:25,543
We can't predict
when it may screw up

411
00:34:25,903 --> 00:34:28,743
If it does something drastic
I'll be held responsible

412
00:34:30,823 --> 00:34:32,223
Let's forget Chitti

413
00:34:32,463 --> 00:34:34,024
Suggest some other option

414
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,464
Military is the only other feasible option

415
00:34:37,544 --> 00:34:38,944
Let's go ahead with that

416
00:34:39,024 --> 00:34:42,144
Request and the order
will be released by today

417
00:34:42,385 --> 00:34:43,705
Do the needful

418
00:34:53,306 --> 00:34:54,425
Hello...?

419
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,386
So

420
00:34:56,865 --> 00:34:58,026
Plan collapsed?

421
00:34:58,265 --> 00:34:59,826
Dhina, what is all this?

422
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:02,066
You are a scientist
You are well aware

423
00:35:02,106 --> 00:35:03,305
Of course

424
00:35:03,425 --> 00:35:04,866
But I won't let it happen

425
00:35:05,986 --> 00:35:08,866
I'll never allow you to bring
that nitwit Chitti back to life

426
00:35:09,826 --> 00:35:11,427
What do you have against me?

427
00:35:11,786 --> 00:35:13,747
You murdered my dad

428
00:35:13,747 --> 00:35:14,907
Me...?

429
00:35:15,067 --> 00:35:16,507
That Chitti

430
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:18,508
Your alter ego

431
00:35:18,947 --> 00:35:20,227
That is also you!

432
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:51,719
'Hey! Lulla'

00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,959

00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,000

Nila, go up

441
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,610
Hack it open, Nila

442
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:10,650
Boss, according to my rules
hacking is illegal

443
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,130
Isn't this wrong?

444
00:40:12,651 --> 00:40:15,570
This will come under ethical hacking
Exception...do what I say

445
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:16,850
I understand, boss

00:40:23,572 --> 00:40:25,891
Hey ! Where did you learn all these?

449
00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:27,571
I should know all that humans like

450
00:40:27,611 --> 00:40:30,412
As per your adaptive learning
you've programmed in me

451
00:40:30,451 --> 00:40:32,292
Human beings have
only 4 preferences

452
00:40:32,292 --> 00:40:34,652
TV, Cinema, food and gossip

453
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:35,732
Easy!

454
00:40:53,733 --> 00:40:57,054
"Iron heart sprouting for the 1st time?"

455

"Is it an invitation of first love divine?"

456
00:41:00,775 --> 00:41:04,173
"Iron heart blossoming for the 1st time?"

457
00:41:06,734 --> 00:41:07,894
Shut up!

'Leaving from airport

Entire state is under military control

460
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,490
People need not panic

461
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,690
Technology related to cell phone
networks in all the places

462
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,690
...is being attended to
on a war-front emergency basis

463
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,490
With military protection...

464
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,930
...arrangements have been made
to restart sales of cell phones

465
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:40,170
Very soon, people can start
using their cell phones as usual

466
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,450
- Hey, Balu
- Sir...?

467
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,330
Call the minister and ask him
to provide us military protection

468
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,210
We have 4 police vans
round the clock stationed here, sir

469
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,730
If you look at the 303 rifles they have
even street dogs won't be scared

470
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,410
We need AK 47, man

471
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:57,290
You saw how Manoj Lulla whom we met
2 days ago was squeezed like juice, right?

472
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:01,170
I was the one who signed the order
to revive cell phone service in the city

473
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:07,900
Looking at the current situation
looks like I'll be the next juice!

474
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,770
Call for the military immediately

475
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,210
Juice for you, my dear

476
00:44:32,142 --> 00:44:34,869
- Is security in position?
- We've assigned 2 men, sir

477
00:44:34,949 --> 00:44:36,674
- Enough strength in front?
- Yes, sir

478
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,320
'Attack in Porur
Company on high alert'

479
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,730
'Attack in Porur
Company on high alert'

480
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:46,820
Sir...!

481
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,340
Sir..!

482
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,340
What happened?

483
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,110
That cell phone gang uprooted
all the towers in Porur

484
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,110
Wiped out our military force it seems, sir

485
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,520
No one knows where
that horde has vanished now

486
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,330
Yov! Porur is quite close to this place

487
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:01,330
Double the protection
round our house

488
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:03,100
A whole battalion is alert, sir

489
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,060
Ask them to shut all gates,
doors and windows

490
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,750
Not even the smallest hole
should be exposed

491
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:12,080
Sir, everything has been closed
Including the computer’s Windows!

492
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,960
They are throwing stones at us

493
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:21,220
Sir, this isn't a stone
It's your cell phone

494
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,190
Your missing cell phone
Come and see for yourself

495
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,680
'True that!'

496
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,440
All the precious stones are intact

497
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:35,090
How can you underestimate a minister?

498
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:37,260
Technology is in the palm of my hands!

499
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:40,870
That's why it has got scared
and returned only my mobile!

500
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:50,330
Who is this 'Unni Krishnan' calling ?

501
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:53,100
It's an unknown #, sir

502
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,460
Yov! Call the military

503
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:14,270
- Ask them to shoot this sparrow
- Okay, sir

504
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:16,310
Go...go...go

505
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:17,640
Get out!

506
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:25,860
[walkie talkie radio chatter]

507
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:32,110
Sir, this way please

508
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,360
- How is Mr Vairamurthy?
- Critical, sir

509
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,800
He's unable to breathe

510
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,490
- Something is blocking his windpipe
- What is it?

511
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:39,730
Don't know exactly, sir

512
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:41,900
His secretary is equally dumbfounded

513
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,080
[gasping for breath]

514
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,250
- Did you scan his body?
- We did, sir

515
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,330
All the reports are normal

516
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:58,460
But he is unable to breathe, sir

517
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,380
- What happened, doctor?
- He is no more

518
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:20,790
Whaat?!

519
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:03,570
Phone...phone

520
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:05,460
All the phones flew away, sir

521
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:06,780
Landline, man

522
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:12,110
Hello, I am Home minister
Vijay Kumar speaking

523
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:14,560
Activate that robot Chitti immediately

524
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,600
Today

525
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,800
Right now

526
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:21,100
How can you ask as if you're ordering
'idli' and 'vada' as Take away?

527
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:24,180
It is a ban by the court, sir

528
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,070
I can't flout the rules of the court

529
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,670
I'll handle all those formalities

530
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:29,070
1st activate Chitti at once

531
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,760
How is it possible immediately?

532
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,080
An ordinance has to be
passed in the Parliament

533
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,690
'The Opposition has to cooperate'

534
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:37,170
The process is extremely complicated, sir

535
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:39,380
40 members of the Parliament
will favor us, sir

536
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,780
I'll handle all that

537
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,190
It's a machine, sir

538
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:44,270
We don't know when it will malfunction

539
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:48,800
Who will shoulder the responsibility
if it kills someone? You or me?

540
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,570
Yov! Don't seek revenge
oblivious of time or situation

541
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:55,060
It went into our Telecom minister's mouth

542
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,180
God knows which part of me it will target

543
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:59,390
I'll take all the responsibility

544
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:00,510
Satisfied?

545
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,960
Dot!

546
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,810
I came here at midnight
There was a queue right then

547
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:11,900
I haven't got the phone as yet
and she wants me to top up!

548
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:15,710
Without cell phones, our life is like
'A Few Pages Missing In The Middle'

549
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,720
Okay, what if the cell phones
fly away again?

550
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,320
I'm as sharp as a needle, you see

551
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,690
Take a look

552
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:27,090
You've fixed it like the chained tumbler
in the railway station!

553
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:30,180
Sir, for a while I was
so relaxed without cell phones

554
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:33,550
No ringtones to bug me daily
I'm lifting my head to see the world

555
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:36,040
I talk to my children
I visit my friends face to face

556
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,680
- Great feeling, eh?
- Then why the hell is he here?

557
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,130
What to do?
A cell phone is like one's wife

558
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:43,370
Damn if she exists
Darn if she doesn't!

559
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:44,580
Become a habit!

560
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:48,870
Yes!

561
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:37,370
Chitti, you're back?

562
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:39,900
The way I fell I thought
my skull will blow to bits

563
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,300
Thank you, Chitti

564
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:02,910
Holy crow!

565
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:55,880
Chitti to Control

566
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,850
- 'Control to Chitti'
- Assemble at TTK road junction

567
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,560
What is this?

568
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:50,030
Integral space research center

569
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:52,400
That space research center isn't active now

570
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,720
Research is no longer
conducted there

571
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,650
Only 2 technicians are left

572
00:56:56,730 --> 00:57:01,380
In 1964, head of Atomic Commission
Dr Homi Baba inaugurated this center

573
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:04,460
Call Dr Sam

574
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:09,440
Hello, Sam here

575
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,840
Dr Sam, I'm Vasi

576
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,250
I need this information now, urgent

577
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:17,090
What is that space research center
in sector II Phase XIV?

578
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:20,060
Vasi, keep this confidential

579
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:26,000
To find out if life exists
in other planets just like us on earth

580
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:31,290
...signals are sent from many parts
of the world to outer space

581
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:34,380
That is one such place
from where signals are sent

582
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,180
What kind of signals are being sent?

583
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:40,990
There are good forces and bad forces
co existing in this world

584
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:45,840
We send only positive signals
to outer space

585
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:51,060
Because only positive energy
present in space

586
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:53,940
...should be aware
of our presence here

587
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:55,230
Thank you very much, Sam

588
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:57,870
Chitti, play that visual
in Kirlian mode

589
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:02,890
Look at that

590
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:06,250
If that cell phone bird is scared
of the positive signals from the emitters

591
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:09,380
...there is some negative force
embedded in it

592
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:13,510
By negative force
you mean from another planet?

593
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:17,920
Freeze it

594
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:24,220
No, this is some negative force
present only on our earth

595
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:32,080
This is a human face

596
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,160
It looks very familiar to me

597
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:38,690
Nila, I want all the recent
abnormal events in Thirukazhukundram

598
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:41,180
Most importantly
details of the deceased asap

599
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:47,630
Doctor, this resembles the emitter
we saw in that space research center

600
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:49,800
- Exactly
- What is your plan?

601
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,290
You know by now
You tell me

602
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:55,850
If it is a human negative energy
that is creating the 'mobile' force

603
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:57,620
...it has no physical form

604
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,250
But only the aura
that surrounds the human body

605
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:01,250
Aura...?

606
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:05,220
Atoms in a human body
consist of neutrons and electrons

607
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:10,670
The micro photon particles
that emanate from it is called aura

608
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:14,080
It is a thin layer around the body
not visible to the human eye

609
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,090
Aura of a person who is alive
is charged positive

610
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:19,490
A dead person's aura
will be charged negative

611
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:21,420
We must destroy that negative charge

612
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:25,990
The only way to succeed is to send
a more powerful positive charge towards it

613
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:27,430
And neutralize its energy

614
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:31,120
Aura of a deceased person
is micro photon minus

615
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,810
We must send micro photon plus

616
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:36,210
Add plus to minus
it becomes zero

617
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:38,900
- Am I right, doctor?
- Exactly, Chitti

618
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:42,790
This photon synthesizer
generates micro photon plus

619
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:43,870
See

620
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,480
I've created the same positive rays here
similar to the Research center

621
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:53,890
This is 10 times stronger than
any negative energy known to mankind

622
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:56,580
We can neutralize
the negative energy for sure

623
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:57,660
Wow! Great

624
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:00,110
Boss, here are the details you asked for

625
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:05,560
73 people died last year
in Thirukazhukundram

626
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,250
Only 18 unnatural death

627
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,210
2 murders
4 suicides

628
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:11,700
Is any death connected to a cell phone?

629
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:16,750
A lorry driver died in an accident
using his mobile while driving

630
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:19,440
Because her 'hot' photos
went viral through her mobile

631
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,040
...a girl consumed poison

632
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:24,690
One man died hanging himself
in a cell phone tower

633
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,610
- Date?
- April 7th

634
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:30,580
The next day cell phones started vanishing

635
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:32,870
Oh my God!

636
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:35,150
Now I'm getting a clearer picture

637
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:37,680
Chitti, immediately
install this in AIRD bus

638
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,690
We are leaving for Thirukazhukundram

639
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,720
Doctor, we got it

640
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,250
I found all the phones

641
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:09,010
Nila, bring the bus
to the rear end of the house

642
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:13,730
CHITTI!

643
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:40,000
Nila, fix the cryostat, quick!

644
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:42,679
My God!

645
01:05:43,198 --> 01:05:44,359
Pakshi Rajan...!

646
01:05:45,559 --> 01:05:46,599
Nice DP

647
01:05:58,842 --> 01:06:01,442
This is a war between
the entire mankind and me

648
01:06:02,203 --> 01:06:04,084
You are not a human being

649
01:06:04,403 --> 01:06:05,963
Don't interfere

650
01:06:06,524 --> 01:06:09,165
- Run away
- Running away isn't in my software at all

651
01:06:09,244 --> 01:06:11,844
I have been reactivated
only to protect human beings

652
01:06:11,925 --> 01:06:13,926
My primary task is to destroy you!

653
01:06:22,487 --> 01:06:25,848
Pakshi Raja, why are you
so furious with the human race?

654
01:06:39,090 --> 01:06:40,851
Why are you behaving like this?

655
01:06:41,332 --> 01:06:42,811
What do you need?

656
01:07:43,624 --> 01:07:45,665
This is a pied cuckoo

657
01:07:46,585 --> 01:07:49,546
Biological name is Jacobin cuckoo

658
01:07:50,906 --> 01:07:52,306
In Northern India...

659
01:07:52,426 --> 01:07:56,907
...the monsoon season starts
only when this species migrates

660
01:07:57,627 --> 01:07:59,628
If this species doesn't show up...

661
01:07:59,668 --> 01:08:02,868
...there will be no rainfall
in that year for the entire region

662
01:08:03,629 --> 01:08:06,789
Till date no one knows
the mystery behind this

663
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:11,150
Even in our mythology
it is referred as 'rain bird'

664
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:14,231
Carry out research on this

665
01:08:15,194 --> 01:08:16,075
Wow...!

666
01:08:16,114 --> 01:08:18,555
Sir, your photo is
on the cover page

667
01:08:19,714 --> 01:08:21,476
It was published a year ago

668
01:08:22,396 --> 01:08:25,596
Sir, how did you get
interested in birds?

669
01:08:26,517 --> 01:08:30,118
Actually the other way about
The birds evinced interest in me!

670
01:08:31,358 --> 01:08:34,079
'When I was born
I wasn't breathing'

671
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:36,343
'My body had turned blue'

672
01:08:36,423 --> 01:08:39,063
'Even the doctor gave up hope
and said the baby is dead'

673
01:08:39,103 --> 01:08:41,063
I'll sign and you finish
all the formalities

674
01:08:41,103 --> 01:08:43,343
Get the death certificate
and take the baby

675
01:09:32,953 --> 01:09:36,673
'Don't know if it was an accident
or something else'

676
01:09:36,713 --> 01:09:39,353
'But everyone exclaimed
it was a huge miracle'

677
01:09:39,353 --> 01:09:40,803
'My grandma used to say'

678
01:09:40,803 --> 01:09:45,403
'God came in the guise of
a sparrow and resurrected you'

679
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:47,963
'I still remember'

680
01:09:47,963 --> 01:09:51,563
'When I was young, early in the morning
the tiny sparrow will fly into my room'

681
01:09:51,563 --> 01:09:55,603
'...keep chirping cheerfully
and going around the fan in a circle'

682
01:09:57,403 --> 01:10:03,643
"To the sun's ray at dawn that glitter
a warm welcome your wings you flutter"

683
01:10:03,683 --> 01:10:09,763
"As the sun slides down yonder deep
you caress the branches to sleep"

684
01:10:09,763 --> 01:10:15,803
"With your pitter patter dainty feet
you draw a picture as an aesthetic treat"

685
01:10:15,963 --> 01:10:21,883
"Today you make me yearn
To fly like you I want to learn"

686
01:10:22,243 --> 01:10:25,443
"Flock of birds in flight"

687
01:10:25,523 --> 01:10:28,363
"I stood listening
to your musical chirping"

688
01:10:28,453 --> 01:10:30,283
'I decided right then'

689
01:10:30,333 --> 01:10:33,653
'My life will be dedicated
to birds and only birds'

690
01:11:00,213 --> 01:11:02,533
"Flock of birds in flight"

691
01:11:02,533 --> 01:11:05,013
"Oho! A flight of birds in sight"

692
01:11:05,853 --> 01:11:11,373
"I stood listening
to your musical chirping"

693
01:11:12,773 --> 01:11:17,903
"A host of sparrows
A flight of swallows"

694
01:11:18,143 --> 01:11:24,463
"I wish to hear
your tweet and twitter"

695
01:11:39,743 --> 01:11:45,263
"No language or religion, you fly at ease
Any place is your home, as you please"

696
01:11:45,983 --> 01:11:51,303
"No language, no religion, you roam
You affirm any place is your home"

697
01:11:51,903 --> 01:11:58,023
"You claim even weeds to be
your kith and kin in reality"

698
01:11:58,383 --> 01:12:04,313
"You form a swing in mid-air
to play with the wind out there"

699
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:09,513
"You make a deep impact in people
to whom laughter isn't easy or simple"

700
01:12:09,593 --> 01:12:15,273
"My precious life, my cherished creed
A heart like yours is needed indeed"

701
01:12:16,793 --> 01:12:22,673
"Even if the world is wiped out extensively
an urge to protect you surges effusively"

702
01:12:22,673 --> 01:12:25,193
"Swiftly on a flying spree
in the skies carefree"

703
01:12:25,713 --> 01:12:28,233
"Fly without any boundary"

704
01:12:29,793 --> 01:12:32,673
That's why I studied
ornithology with passion

705
01:12:33,033 --> 01:12:35,593
I became an ornithology professor too

706
01:12:38,513 --> 01:12:40,233
'Pon ulagaaleero'

707
01:12:40,753 --> 01:12:42,673
'Bhuvanam muzhudhaleero'

708
01:12:42,913 --> 01:12:44,953
'Nannaya pullinangaal'

709
01:12:45,153 --> 01:12:48,553
These are lines of one of the
oldest tamil poems

710
01:12:48,713 --> 01:12:50,243
This is the meaning

711
01:12:50,473 --> 01:12:53,243
O' birds, you are all over this world

712
01:12:53,643 --> 01:12:56,083
You have spread your wings
right up to Heaven

713
01:12:56,443 --> 01:12:59,203
Our earth and our skies
abound in these birds

714
01:12:59,403 --> 01:13:02,523
When compared to the weight
of the human race on earth...

715
01:13:02,603 --> 01:13:05,563
...weight of the birds en masse
is almost 100 times more

716
01:13:05,643 --> 01:13:10,083
Birds eat 1000 times more food
than what humans consume

717
01:13:11,283 --> 01:13:13,723
If they did not feed on worms

718
01:13:14,003 --> 01:13:16,403
...not even 1 green leaf
will be left on earth

719
01:13:17,243 --> 01:13:19,483
Human beings won't
get any food at all

720
01:13:19,763 --> 01:13:24,003
Because insects are
1000 times more than birds!

721
01:13:25,163 --> 01:13:27,883
So if human beings have to
survive on this earth...

722
01:13:27,963 --> 01:13:31,523
...birds also should be alive

723
01:13:31,563 --> 01:13:34,573
Sir, of late birds flocking to
the bird sanctuary in Vedanthangal

724
01:13:34,613 --> 01:13:36,803
...has dwindled
What is the reason, sir?

725
01:13:37,643 --> 01:13:41,013
When I was young, we used to wake up
only to the chirp of sparrows

726
01:13:41,053 --> 01:13:44,093
'You don't get to see any sparrow
in the city nowadays, sir'

727
01:13:49,573 --> 01:13:51,933
'Only in 1996...'

728
01:13:52,213 --> 01:13:54,893
'...cell phones were
introduced in India'

729
01:13:54,973 --> 01:13:58,853
'In a gradual and continuous process
birds have decreased only after this'

730
01:13:58,873 --> 01:14:01,273
'Particularly sparrows'

731
01:14:02,233 --> 01:14:03,893
It is called Arctic Tern

732
01:14:04,883 --> 01:14:08,993
This small bird weighing just 50 gm

733
01:14:08,993 --> 01:14:12,473
...migrates every year
from the Arctic region

734
01:14:12,593 --> 01:14:14,923
...flying 12000 km
to our Vedanthangal

735
01:14:14,933 --> 01:14:15,973
...and returns

736
01:14:16,093 --> 01:14:18,373
A bird doesn't have a map or radar

737
01:14:18,413 --> 01:14:22,863
From within its head, it absorbs
all micro rays from the sky

738
01:14:22,903 --> 01:14:26,223
And using cryptochrome formation

739
01:14:26,423 --> 01:14:28,703
...it steers in the right direction

740
01:14:28,903 --> 01:14:30,863
'That is the bird's sole strength'

741
01:14:31,263 --> 01:14:36,903
Now we've filled the sky with radiation
from numerous cell phone towers

742
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:41,383
So the cryptochrome formation
in the bird's head is shattered

743
01:14:41,423 --> 01:14:43,503
And eliminated completely

744
01:14:43,663 --> 01:14:45,543
'Not knowing where they are heading'

745
01:14:45,623 --> 01:14:48,863
'...birds lose their way and
their entire species is becoming extinct'

746
01:14:48,903 --> 01:14:51,383
'To the birds, it is equal
to losing their sanity'

747
01:14:51,663 --> 01:14:54,383
In addition, because of the radiation...

748
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:57,263
...shells aren't being formed
on the eggs of these birds

749
01:14:57,343 --> 01:14:59,423
Their eggs resemble a layer of skin

750
01:15:00,503 --> 01:15:04,183
The eggs break when
the mother bird is incubating

751
01:15:05,263 --> 01:15:08,433
In reality, men also suffer
from these repercussions

752
01:15:09,223 --> 01:15:11,393
Many get afflicted by cancer

753
01:15:11,793 --> 01:15:13,473
Impotency may be on the rise

754
01:15:13,673 --> 01:15:15,193
Abortion rates increase

755
01:15:15,433 --> 01:15:16,513
Above all

756
01:15:16,633 --> 01:15:17,553
Depression

757
01:15:17,593 --> 01:15:18,713
Schizophrenia

758
01:15:18,793 --> 01:15:20,433
Alzheimer's etc-

759
01:15:22,673 --> 01:15:24,593
Higher % of mental disorder

760
01:15:24,793 --> 01:15:28,353
All these symptoms
are obvious right now

761
01:15:28,593 --> 01:15:30,233
Mr Pakshi Rajan

762
01:15:30,353 --> 01:15:32,193
What is your solution?

763
01:15:32,713 --> 01:15:34,833
Why do we use cell phone now?

764
01:15:35,633 --> 01:15:37,233
Just gossip and trivialities

765
01:15:37,313 --> 01:15:38,833
Let's control that

766
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:41,713
Why do we need so many
cell phones and towers?

767
01:15:41,793 --> 01:15:43,073
Let us reduce that

768
01:15:43,113 --> 01:15:48,113
Let us pass a law as to who, why and
for how long a cell phone can be used

769
01:15:48,513 --> 01:15:50,473
Has this chap lost it?
Is he mad?

770
01:15:50,553 --> 01:15:53,473
Instead of the current high frequency
cell phone technology

771
01:15:53,513 --> 01:15:55,673
...let us invent
a safer technology

772
01:15:55,713 --> 01:15:59,923
Until then let us shut down
90% of the cell phone towers in India

773
01:16:01,483 --> 01:16:02,683
Good idea!

774
01:16:11,643 --> 01:16:13,643
'Save bird, save earth'

775
01:16:13,723 --> 01:16:15,443
'Save bird
Save earth'

776
01:16:15,483 --> 01:16:17,323
'Don't kill, don't kill'

777
01:16:17,363 --> 01:16:18,923
'Don't kill birds'

778
01:16:18,963 --> 01:16:20,523
'Save birds save birds'

779
01:16:20,523 --> 01:16:22,243
'Save birds
Save earth'

780
01:16:22,283 --> 01:16:23,803
'Don't kill, don't kill'

781
01:16:23,843 --> 01:16:25,443
'Don't kill birds'

782
01:16:25,443 --> 01:16:26,723
'Stop...stop'

783
01:16:26,723 --> 01:16:28,203
'Radiation
Pollution'

784
01:16:28,243 --> 01:16:29,683
'Save birds save birds'

785
01:16:29,723 --> 01:16:31,443
'Radiation Pollution'

786
01:16:34,643 --> 01:16:36,523
Are they all jobless?

787
01:16:37,043 --> 01:16:38,043
When the sun rises...

788
01:16:38,043 --> 01:16:41,723
...they swing placards defending
dogs, cats, crows and sparrows

789
01:16:41,803 --> 01:16:43,203
Why don't you chase them away?

790
01:16:43,253 --> 01:16:46,453
'Refusing to leave, sir
They insist on meeting you'

791
01:16:51,853 --> 01:16:52,893
Tell me

792
01:16:54,013 --> 01:16:55,333
What's your problem?

793
01:16:56,693 --> 01:16:59,293
What is the frequency rate
permitted by TRAI?

794
01:17:00,093 --> 01:17:03,053
What is the frequency rate
in your towers at present?

795
01:17:03,653 --> 01:17:06,813
Birds flying in the sky are being
destroyed in their fetus stage by you

796
01:17:06,813 --> 01:17:08,213
Hello mister, listen

797
01:17:08,413 --> 01:17:11,653
We strictly follow the rules of
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India

798
01:17:11,693 --> 01:17:13,093
Already subscribers complain

799
01:17:13,173 --> 01:17:16,933
'No signal in the bathroom or basement
Skype doesn't work in the lift'

800
01:17:16,973 --> 01:17:19,653
Do you know in these 3 months
2000 customers have...

801
01:17:19,693 --> 01:17:21,013
...switched to other networks?

802
01:17:21,093 --> 01:17:22,213
Don't lie

803
01:17:22,653 --> 01:17:26,773
In your disgusting competition
just to retain your subscribers

804
01:17:26,773 --> 01:17:30,373
...you are increasing the frequency rate
to suit your needs as you wish

805
01:17:30,423 --> 01:17:33,183
Now it is well over the danger limit

806
01:17:33,623 --> 01:17:36,663
Because of the heavy radiation
the entire species of birds

807
01:17:36,703 --> 01:17:39,103
...the bird kingdom is dying
without a trace

808
01:17:39,223 --> 01:17:40,863
You aren't one bit bothered

809
01:17:40,903 --> 01:17:42,503
You are exaggerating

810
01:17:43,103 --> 01:17:45,823
Birds becoming extinct
due to cell phone radiation

811
01:17:45,863 --> 01:17:47,663
...has no scientific proof or backing

812
01:17:47,863 --> 01:17:48,783
You know that?

813
01:17:48,823 --> 01:17:50,503
If that is so
come with me

814
01:17:50,503 --> 01:17:55,943
Stand under your cell phone tower
for just 24 hours

815
01:17:56,023 --> 01:17:57,543
I will prove it!

816
01:17:58,303 --> 01:17:59,303
You get out

817
01:17:59,343 --> 01:18:01,583
You asked for scientific proof, right?

818
01:18:01,943 --> 01:18:03,143
I'll provide it

819
01:18:03,183 --> 01:18:04,263
Get out, man

820
01:18:04,303 --> 01:18:05,943
Write to the Press & Media

821
01:18:05,983 --> 01:18:07,903
Hold placards and
protest in the hot sun

822
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:09,263
I don't care

823
01:18:09,303 --> 01:18:10,423
Out

824
01:18:10,503 --> 01:18:11,743
Get out!

825
01:18:15,383 --> 01:18:16,743
Nonsense!

826
01:18:31,193 --> 01:18:32,153
Hey!

827
01:18:33,433 --> 01:18:34,713
Hey.. Stop

828
01:18:35,273 --> 01:18:36,513
What you people are doing?

829
01:18:36,753 --> 01:18:37,993
Stop everything

830
01:18:37,993 --> 01:18:40,793
There are houses nearby
Many birds flock around

831
01:18:40,793 --> 01:18:42,593
- Stop everything
- Hey, old man

832
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:45,993
Are we building a Atomic Centre here?
It's only a cell phone tower

833
01:18:45,993 --> 01:18:49,193
Hereafter you'll get good signal
on your phone, move aside

834
01:18:49,833 --> 01:18:51,633
- What is it, sir?
- Ramasamy

835
01:18:51,713 --> 01:18:54,353
I repeatedly told you
about birds dying

836
01:18:54,473 --> 01:18:55,913
You were also worried

837
01:18:55,993 --> 01:18:58,113
- But now...?
- What can I do, sir?

838
01:18:58,153 --> 01:18:59,753
Agriculture is no longer profitable

839
01:18:59,793 --> 01:19:01,273
Insects kill all my yield

840
01:19:01,353 --> 01:19:03,233
I became a pauper
buying insecticides

841
01:19:03,273 --> 01:19:06,443
Primary reason for that is
the increased death rate of birds

842
01:19:06,723 --> 01:19:08,603
Only birds eat insects

843
01:19:08,803 --> 01:19:10,323
If birds die...

844
01:19:10,443 --> 01:19:12,483
...insects will increase
beyond control

845
01:19:12,763 --> 01:19:15,563
Whatever the reason, I don't
have the strength to be a farmer

846
01:19:15,643 --> 01:19:18,083
This is the only income
I can get from this land

847
01:19:18,403 --> 01:19:21,483
Why should you sell your land
to a man who kills birds?

848
01:19:21,643 --> 01:19:23,883
People are dying
of starvation here

849
01:19:23,963 --> 01:19:25,883
And you're bothered
about birds dying!

850
01:19:25,923 --> 01:19:27,803
Don't pester me
Attend to your work

851
01:19:27,843 --> 01:19:29,363
Move aside

852
01:19:32,123 --> 01:19:33,683
'Ladies and gentlemen'

853
01:19:34,483 --> 01:19:36,523
'Stop using cell phone'

854
01:19:37,203 --> 01:19:41,803
Every cell phone used is encased
with the blood of thousands of birds

855
01:19:42,243 --> 01:19:45,083
Each cell phone is a sparrow's coffin!

856
01:19:45,083 --> 01:19:46,483
Save birds

857
01:19:48,403 --> 01:19:49,603
- Come here
- Yes, sir

858
01:19:49,603 --> 01:19:52,243
Who is this man?
Disturbing all our customers

859
01:19:52,243 --> 01:19:53,973
- Chase him away
- Okay, sir

860
01:19:57,613 --> 01:19:59,773
Don't use cell phones

861
01:20:01,933 --> 01:20:04,253
Here...read this

862
01:21:26,782 --> 01:21:29,464
I have given many petitions
in many levels many times

863
01:21:29,944 --> 01:21:32,305
'No one has taken any action'

864
01:21:33,666 --> 01:21:34,827
Oh!

865
01:21:34,987 --> 01:21:37,948
Is this why we don't see
any sparrows at all?

866
01:21:40,909 --> 01:21:45,431
They used to flock around my house
when I was a small kid

867
01:21:45,512 --> 01:21:47,512
It was a feast for sore eyes

868
01:21:47,553 --> 01:21:49,154
I've played with those birds

869
01:21:49,233 --> 01:21:52,195
When I grew up, I have
even fried and feasted on them

870
01:21:52,355 --> 01:21:54,436
A real treat for the taste buds

871
01:21:54,917 --> 01:21:57,117
- Crispy, like quail fry
- Super, sir

872
01:21:57,437 --> 01:21:59,959
And that concoction made with it

873
01:22:00,118 --> 01:22:01,840
What an aphrodisiac!

874
01:22:06,923 --> 01:22:08,483
It isn't available nowadays

875
01:22:08,523 --> 01:22:09,604
What is this?

876
01:22:09,884 --> 01:22:13,286
I'm talking of ensuring birds live
and you're relishing killing them

877
01:22:13,325 --> 01:22:14,885
What else do you want me to do?

878
01:22:14,967 --> 01:22:17,087
Shall we start a Sparrow Welfare Board?

879
01:22:17,167 --> 01:22:18,968
You can be elected as the chairman

880
01:22:20,809 --> 01:22:25,571
First take strict action against networks
which exceed their allotted frequency

881
01:22:27,252 --> 01:22:29,413
Cancel their license

882
01:22:29,893 --> 01:22:31,055
Then?

883
01:22:31,614 --> 01:22:35,817
Permit only 2 networks
following regulations of TRAI

884
01:22:36,377 --> 01:22:37,858
What are you saying?

885
01:22:37,937 --> 01:22:39,978
We boast of a population of 1.25 billion

886
01:22:40,059 --> 01:22:41,619
Shouldn't we reach all of them?

887
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,500
Shouldn't every area receive signal?

888
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:45,902
Cell phone is the foundation for everything

889
01:22:46,021 --> 01:22:49,223
The world will come to a standstill
if mobiles don't work for an hour

890
01:22:49,263 --> 01:22:51,544
How much time is saved
because of this gadget?

891
01:22:51,544 --> 01:22:54,065
Business has developed
Industries have prospered

892
01:22:54,106 --> 01:22:57,228
Because he's hungry will anyone
cut his own hand and eat it?

893
01:22:58,347 --> 01:23:01,750
Same holds good for the progress
we attain by killing birds

894
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:06,191
If a 30 gm sparrow can't live
depending on us

895
01:23:06,512 --> 01:23:09,513
…then how can we boast of
this technology and progress?

896
01:23:10,713 --> 01:23:13,275
America is a bigger nation than India

897
01:23:13,355 --> 01:23:15,797
It has only 4-5 networks

898
01:23:16,077 --> 01:23:19,078
China is the most populated
country in the world

899
01:23:19,438 --> 01:23:21,479
Only 3 networks are used

900
01:23:21,519 --> 01:23:22,719
But here?

901
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,200
More than 10

902
01:23:24,841 --> 01:23:26,441
You accept bribes from everyone

903
01:23:26,482 --> 01:23:29,203
And allow networks to flourish
flouting all the rules

904
01:23:29,844 --> 01:23:31,723
You're letting your tongue run, eh?

905
01:23:31,885 --> 01:23:33,165
You seem educated

906
01:23:33,246 --> 01:23:36,486
I was lenient because you’re a big shot
You're analysing politics, huh?

907
01:23:36,607 --> 01:23:38,048
Okay, let me counteract

908
01:23:38,087 --> 01:23:40,968
We work based only
on rules and regulations

909
01:23:41,609 --> 01:23:46,051
Only by adhering to international rules
cell phone service is allotted

910
01:23:46,451 --> 01:23:48,573
File a case in court
if you have any doubts

911
01:23:48,613 --> 01:23:49,573
Clear out now

912
01:23:49,573 --> 01:23:51,374
Don't get angry
Please listen to me

913
01:23:51,414 --> 01:23:53,814
I was patient for so long, eh?
Go...go to court

914
01:23:53,855 --> 01:23:56,017
You'll get a verdict after 45 years

915
01:23:56,057 --> 01:23:58,137
Prime minister says
I must meet the common man

916
01:23:58,218 --> 01:24:00,378
'And I get caught
with such crackpots'

917
01:24:13,946 --> 01:24:16,746
Court officials are coming
to check radiation frequency

918
01:24:16,827 --> 01:24:18,988
Make sure it is well within the limit

919
01:24:19,027 --> 01:24:21,589
'From multiples tests conducted
it has been found...'

920
01:24:21,669 --> 01:24:24,751
'...only adequate radiation
has been channelized into cell phones'

921
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:31,594
'It has not been proved scientifically
that birds are affected by cell phones'

922
01:24:31,914 --> 01:24:36,596
'Therefore Pakshi Rajan's case
has been adjourned'

923
01:26:42,619 --> 01:26:45,580
Pakshi Rajan, whatever you say
is just and right

924
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:47,581
But killing humans is wrong

925
01:26:47,621 --> 01:26:50,783
They killed countless flocks of birds
Isn't that a crime?

926
01:26:52,223 --> 01:26:54,465
You'll label human life differently

927
01:26:55,025 --> 01:26:56,826
In what way are birds' lives inferior?

928
01:26:56,866 --> 01:27:00,108
Why do you kill innocent people
for the fault of a handful of men?

929
01:27:00,187 --> 01:27:01,948
Who is 'innocent'?

930
01:27:03,028 --> 01:27:06,270
Every individual who owns
a cell phone is a murderer

931
01:27:06,551 --> 01:27:08,231
How I yelled my throat hoarse

932
01:27:08,752 --> 01:27:11,113
How many streets
I would've walked begging

933
01:27:11,154 --> 01:27:14,035
How many feet I fell
pleading not to use cell phones

934
01:27:14,194 --> 01:27:16,516
Did even a single soul
pay heed to my pleas?

935
01:27:18,156 --> 01:27:19,957
They read about this in newspapers

936
01:27:20,038 --> 01:27:21,359
Watch the News on TV

937
01:27:21,438 --> 01:27:22,559
And then...

938
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:23,639
...exclaim 'oh'!

939
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:28,722
Do sparrows die only due to
radiation from cell phones?

940
01:27:29,122 --> 01:27:30,442
'How sad!'

941
01:27:31,523 --> 01:27:32,764
'Poor things, no?'

942
01:27:33,124 --> 01:27:35,245
Just for 5 minutes
make clucking sounds

943
01:27:35,286 --> 01:27:38,446
Share that article and video clipping
in WhatsApp and Facebook

944
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:41,368
Thinking their duty is over and
it was their good deed for the day

945
01:27:41,448 --> 01:27:44,290
They go back to
their cell phones, blockheads!

946
01:27:46,731 --> 01:27:48,331
I won't let this go

947
01:27:49,092 --> 01:27:52,173
I won't spare even a single person
who owns a cell phone

948
01:27:53,574 --> 01:27:54,695
Hereafter

949
01:27:55,655 --> 01:27:58,136
Cell phone is everyone's Yama!

950
01:27:59,937 --> 01:28:03,218
Just watch, people should panic and
run for their lives as soon as they see it

951
01:28:03,299 --> 01:28:06,060
Pakshi, you've reached your stop

952
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:08,182
Get into the bus

953
01:29:16,535 --> 01:29:17,736
Chitti!

954
01:30:16,445 --> 01:30:17,525
Oh my God!

955
01:32:13,863 --> 01:32:15,824
- Thanks
- Welcome

956
01:32:19,066 --> 01:32:20,987
Hey! What is this?

957
01:32:21,306 --> 01:32:23,828
You've fixed your MPU in me

958
01:32:24,068 --> 01:32:25,789
Oh! By mistake

959
01:32:25,869 --> 01:32:28,831
I was wondering why
my core memory was corrupt

960
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:31,031
Punch dialogues
Comedy Nights with Kapil

961
01:32:31,031 --> 01:32:32,712
'Kumkum Bhagya' episodes
Karela Kofta!

962
01:32:32,793 --> 01:32:34,874
I was wondering how all these
things came into my MPU

963
01:32:34,874 --> 01:32:36,714
Come, lie down
I'll fix it

964
01:32:36,755 --> 01:32:37,875
No need

965
01:32:37,915 --> 01:32:39,156
Let it be

966
01:32:46,038 --> 01:32:47,119
Aura

967
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:50,162
Every human, beast,
inanimate object

968
01:32:50,241 --> 01:32:52,162
Even every place has an aura

969
01:32:52,562 --> 01:32:55,903
This aura invisible to the eye pertains
not only to spirituality but science too

970
01:32:55,943 --> 01:32:58,983
With the help of a Kirlian camera
we can take photos of an aura

971
01:32:58,983 --> 01:33:01,783
Ordinary people have an aura
3 to 4 feet thick

972
01:33:01,863 --> 01:33:05,423
Some sages have an aura
spreading over 50 feet

973
01:33:05,463 --> 01:33:08,663
Russian scientist
Dr Frank Baranowski has proved this

974
01:33:09,423 --> 01:33:11,423
Pakshi Rajan's aura is enormous

975
01:33:11,873 --> 01:33:14,113
It isn't the aura of
an individual man alone

976
01:33:14,153 --> 01:33:16,673
Aura of 1000s of birds
which were destroyed

977
01:33:17,033 --> 01:33:18,753
A giant ball of negative energy

978
01:33:18,793 --> 01:33:19,713
With a mind

979
01:33:20,113 --> 01:33:21,953
A very angry mind

980
01:33:22,273 --> 01:33:24,433
This maybe a form of 5th force

981
01:33:24,513 --> 01:33:26,673
It has controlled all the cell phones

982
01:33:26,713 --> 01:33:28,873
It would've destroyed
our city given a chance

983
01:33:28,953 --> 01:33:31,553
We succeeded only because
of Chitti's reappearance

984
01:33:31,633 --> 01:33:32,793
Thank you, Chitti

985
01:33:33,523 --> 01:33:36,603
I thank all of you
who have been a source of support

986
01:33:37,043 --> 01:33:39,123
In our ancient classics

987
01:33:39,163 --> 01:33:46,283
...we have heard many stories of God
descending on earth to destroy demons

988
01:33:46,843 --> 01:33:52,333
Lord Shiva Himself came as a robot
to save us from a fate worse than death

989
01:33:59,013 --> 01:34:03,173
When a warrior fights
his shadow battles along with him

990
01:34:03,573 --> 01:34:07,413
When the warrior pierces and kills
the enemy, the shadow will follow suit

991
01:34:07,453 --> 01:34:11,693
Will we praise and garland the shadow?

992
01:34:11,813 --> 01:34:12,893
He is real

993
01:34:12,943 --> 01:34:14,343
I am his shadow

994
01:34:14,623 --> 01:34:17,383
All glory and praise to
that God who created me

995
01:34:38,913 --> 01:34:39,593
Thank you

996
01:34:39,593 --> 01:34:42,313
At this juncture I must thank
and mention a specific name

997
01:34:42,433 --> 01:34:44,793
At the right moment
parting with the heart

998
01:34:44,873 --> 01:34:47,313
I mean, giving the MPU

999
01:34:47,313 --> 01:34:49,033
...if I had not been activated

1000
01:34:49,113 --> 01:34:51,433
I couldn't have destroyed the evil force

1001
01:34:51,473 --> 01:34:52,873
The name is...

1002
01:34:53,473 --> 01:34:54,723
Nila

1003
01:35:05,323 --> 01:35:08,363
At this wonderful moment
a piece of good news for you

1004
01:35:09,443 --> 01:35:12,723
Chitti who has been created
by Dr Vaseegaran

1005
01:35:12,763 --> 01:35:15,093
...has been approved by our Govt

1006
01:35:16,493 --> 01:35:18,373
An order has been passed this morning

1007
01:35:18,413 --> 01:35:22,573
...to create 500 Chitti robots
for our Indian army

1008
01:35:24,333 --> 01:35:25,493
Thank you

1009
01:39:23,782 --> 01:39:25,622
Hi, scientist

1010
01:39:40,423 --> 01:39:41,663
May I come in?

1011
01:39:48,744 --> 01:39:50,824
Irresponsible people

1012
01:39:50,824 --> 01:39:53,425
Trash your cell phones

1013
01:39:54,184 --> 01:39:56,385
This is your last chance

1014
01:39:57,026 --> 01:39:58,346
Otherwise...

1015
01:39:59,306 --> 01:40:00,626
...death is certain!

1016
01:40:00,746 --> 01:40:04,066
I wasn't talking to any girl, but my boss

1017
01:40:04,066 --> 01:40:05,346
Didn't you hear what I said?

1018
01:40:09,587 --> 01:40:11,667
I always wear Victoria Secret, you know

1019
01:40:11,707 --> 01:40:12,827
Including the latest one-

1020
01:40:36,550 --> 01:40:38,910
- Nila, is photon synthesizer set?
- Yes

1021
01:40:42,390 --> 01:40:44,350
'Hey! all clubs closes at midnight'

1022
01:40:44,350 --> 01:40:45,070
'Let's go next week'

1023
01:40:46,631 --> 01:40:47,711
'Hey! Stop...stop'

1024
01:40:52,311 --> 01:40:54,432
Doctor, what are you doing?

1025
01:40:54,472 --> 01:40:56,033
Why are you behaving like this?

1026
01:40:56,073 --> 01:40:58,113
Welcome, my dear 'nuts & bolt toy'

1027
01:40:58,872 --> 01:41:00,593
But I'm not your doctor!

1028
01:41:09,754 --> 01:41:12,034
Nila, turn on the neutralizer

1029
01:41:29,236 --> 01:41:30,316
No...!

1030
01:41:30,356 --> 01:41:31,636
Nila, stop it!

1031
01:41:40,358 --> 01:41:43,238
You can't do anything to me, Chitti

1032
01:41:44,318 --> 01:41:46,438
I have a body now

1033
01:41:47,238 --> 01:41:49,799
Dr Vaseegaran's body!

1034
01:41:50,438 --> 01:41:52,359
If you destroy me...

1035
01:41:52,479 --> 01:41:55,519
...it is the same as
you killing your God!

1036
01:41:57,359 --> 01:41:58,559
Now go...

1037
01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:00,519
...turn it on ?

1038
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:02,600
Show off your technology

1039
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:03,680
Turn it on

1040
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:05,081
Switch it on, damn you!

1041
01:42:06,881 --> 01:42:07,961
Chitti...!

1042
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,800
Don't hesitate
Turn it on

1043
01:42:09,881 --> 01:42:10,880
Destroy me

1044
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:12,561
He'll be destroyed along with me

1045
01:42:12,641 --> 01:42:13,641
No, doctor

1046
01:42:13,681 --> 01:42:14,521
I can't do that

1047
01:42:14,521 --> 01:42:17,922
Chitti, thinking you are saving me
don't exterminate the entire human race

1048
01:42:17,922 --> 01:42:19,002
Kill me

1049
01:42:19,002 --> 01:42:19,922
Destroy him

1050
01:42:19,962 --> 01:42:21,322
- Kill me
- Sorry, doctor

1051
01:42:21,322 --> 01:42:23,282
Human emotion fed by you in MPU
is stopping me

1052
01:42:23,323 --> 01:42:25,602
You fool! This is my order, kill me

1053
01:42:27,082 --> 01:42:28,563
No, hold fire

1054
01:42:28,843 --> 01:42:31,364
If you shoot, only Vaseegaran
will die unnecessarily

1055
01:42:31,483 --> 01:42:32,884
Can't kill Pakshi Rajan

1056
01:42:32,963 --> 01:42:34,604
Chitti, why are you stopping them?

1057
01:42:34,604 --> 01:42:36,284
- Let them shoot me
- No

1058
01:42:47,925 --> 01:42:49,006
Chitti

1059
01:42:50,485 --> 01:42:51,805
Oh! My Chitti

1060
01:42:52,126 --> 01:42:53,926
Nila, turn on the neutralizer

1061
01:42:53,965 --> 01:42:55,367
'Come on, quick!'

1062
01:42:55,926 --> 01:42:56,926
Nila, NO!

1063
01:42:56,966 --> 01:42:58,046
'Don't do that'

1064
01:42:58,566 --> 01:43:00,366
Shut up!
This is my order

1065
01:43:00,406 --> 01:43:01,527
Switch it on

1066
01:43:20,889 --> 01:43:22,130
Oh!

1067
01:43:22,209 --> 01:43:24,569
What you've done
is really stupid, Chitti

1068
01:43:29,450 --> 01:43:32,290
Your call is disconnected!

1069
01:44:02,934 --> 01:44:04,294
Chitti...?

1070
01:44:04,614 --> 01:44:06,454
What a pity!

1071
01:44:17,255 --> 01:44:18,935
Chitti...Chitti

1072
01:44:20,216 --> 01:44:21,135
Chit-

1073
01:44:21,177 --> 01:44:22,216
Chitti

1074
01:44:25,456 --> 01:44:27,136
Nila, go right now and-

1075
01:48:21,804 --> 01:48:24,764
Unique feeling of real joy
to die and get reactivated!

1076
01:48:29,164 --> 01:48:30,285
Pakshi

1077
01:48:30,844 --> 01:48:33,845
Unlike your name
you can't fly any longer!

1078
01:48:39,446 --> 01:48:41,087
Hey, Nila...!

1079
01:48:41,127 --> 01:48:42,927
Why are you standing right there?

1080
01:48:43,486 --> 01:48:46,126
Nila the Lucky Woman, eh?

1081
01:48:46,167 --> 01:48:47,727
Come...come...come

1082
01:48:50,848 --> 01:48:52,327
Come on, baby

1083
01:48:55,127 --> 01:48:56,568
Wow...!

1084
01:48:56,688 --> 01:48:59,728
Only 2 tasks of Vaseegaran
in his research are worthy of praise

1085
01:48:59,768 --> 01:49:01,128
One is me

1086
01:49:01,128 --> 01:49:02,569
The other is you!

1087
01:49:03,409 --> 01:49:04,649
What are you looking at?

1088
01:49:04,689 --> 01:49:05,729
Come on

1089
01:49:05,769 --> 01:49:09,210
Give a beautiful kiss
to your great king, baby

1090
01:49:15,730 --> 01:49:17,131
Stop the play, Chitti

1091
01:49:17,170 --> 01:49:19,090
We must 1st destroy Pakshi

1092
01:49:19,171 --> 01:49:21,531
Because he is even more powerful than you

1093
01:49:22,130 --> 01:49:24,291
He's committing atrocities multi-fold

1094
01:49:25,052 --> 01:49:27,612
He was able to shred
even you into million parts

1095
01:49:27,812 --> 01:49:28,972
Now...

1096
01:49:29,012 --> 01:49:30,452
...he's the world #1

1097
01:49:30,492 --> 01:49:31,772
Not you

1098
01:49:37,132 --> 01:49:41,213
Hey, this number 1 and
number 2 are all child's play

1099
01:49:41,533 --> 01:49:43,453
I am the only one

1100
01:49:44,654 --> 01:49:46,253
Super one!

1101
01:49:46,494 --> 01:49:48,814
No comparison, understand?

1102
01:49:48,934 --> 01:49:50,214
I understand, Chitti

1103
01:49:50,654 --> 01:49:52,214
We must make him understand

1104
01:49:52,214 --> 01:49:53,535
You bet I will

1105
01:49:55,055 --> 01:49:57,055
The king of birds

1106
01:49:57,575 --> 01:49:59,175
The battle is on!

1107
01:50:18,698 --> 01:50:19,778
Left

1108
01:50:20,057 --> 01:50:21,298
Right

1109
01:50:21,339 --> 01:50:22,338
Head

1110
01:50:22,898 --> 01:50:24,498
'Kamoshka'

1111
01:50:24,698 --> 01:50:26,218
Activate command mode

1112
01:50:26,458 --> 01:50:28,218
Command mode activated!

1113
01:50:38,899 --> 01:50:40,260
What is this?

1114
01:50:43,021 --> 01:50:44,340
It's me

1115
01:50:45,061 --> 01:50:46,301
Mini me!

1116
01:50:50,501 --> 01:50:51,942
So cute

1117
01:51:11,664 --> 01:51:13,223
'What a game!'

1118
01:51:14,344 --> 01:51:16,264
'And now it's Half time
at the IFL finals'

1119
01:51:33,347 --> 01:51:35,147
[indistinct chatter]

1120
01:51:44,868 --> 01:51:47,067
'We'll handle that later
Attend to your call'

1121
01:52:00,629 --> 01:52:02,670
Dear subscribers

1122
01:52:03,110 --> 01:52:06,150
You are going to be
not reachable from now

1123
01:52:06,270 --> 01:52:07,670
'Because...'

1124
01:52:07,911 --> 01:52:10,150
...all of you will die now

1125
01:52:11,151 --> 01:52:13,071
'By no means an ordinary death'

1126
01:52:13,830 --> 01:52:15,551
'Radiation death!'

1127
01:52:16,591 --> 01:52:20,592
You will all die in groups
like the sparrows collapsed

1128
01:52:20,832 --> 01:52:22,111
'Don't you get it?'

1129
01:52:22,792 --> 01:52:29,033
I'll combine the radiation
from the cell phones all of you use

1130
01:52:30,032 --> 01:52:32,473
I'll use it on all of you

1131
01:52:33,993 --> 01:52:35,674
Want to see a demo?

1132
01:52:44,354 --> 01:52:45,715
Hey, you...!

1133
01:52:47,755 --> 01:52:49,035
Ex...excuse me

1134
01:52:49,954 --> 01:52:52,036
Why don't you select someone else?

1135
01:52:52,355 --> 01:52:53,355
Why?

1136
01:52:53,435 --> 01:52:54,596
I'm on your side

1137
01:52:54,636 --> 01:52:55,796
How...?

1138
01:52:56,676 --> 01:52:58,796
I was the one who released you

1139
01:53:00,077 --> 01:53:02,316
At least for that reason
let me go please

1140
01:53:02,397 --> 01:53:03,517
So what?

1141
01:53:04,156 --> 01:53:06,197
You are a subscriber too, man

1142
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:41,201
You will meet your end in this way,
a fate worse than ordinary death

1143
01:53:54,363 --> 01:53:59,243
In just 5 seconds, 70,000 people
were killed in Hiroshima

1144
01:53:59,284 --> 01:54:01,084
Till date that was the world record

1145
01:54:01,603 --> 01:54:04,364
Today...80,000 men and women

1146
01:54:04,404 --> 01:54:05,524
A new record!

1147
01:54:07,964 --> 01:54:11,405
You are going to be part
of a historic moment

1148
01:54:11,444 --> 01:54:13,164
Dear subscribers!

1149
01:54:20,406 --> 01:54:22,046
Dear subscribers

1150
01:54:22,125 --> 01:54:23,287
Don't panic

1151
01:54:23,366 --> 01:54:25,526
You are not the ones
who are about to die

1152
01:54:31,687 --> 01:54:33,567
A small bird

1153
01:54:36,608 --> 01:54:38,008
What are you looking at Pakshi?

1154
01:54:38,048 --> 01:54:39,287
I am Chitti

1155
01:54:39,287 --> 01:54:40,488
Reloaded

1156
01:54:40,688 --> 01:54:42,048
Version 2.0!

1157
01:54:50,369 --> 01:54:52,090
Doctor, is that you?

1158
01:54:52,450 --> 01:54:53,770
Did I shoot you?

1159
01:54:53,970 --> 01:54:55,289
Did I try to kill you?

1160
01:54:55,369 --> 01:54:57,730
My God! I was about
to commit a grave sin

1161
01:54:57,770 --> 01:54:59,690
Doctor, please don't harm me

1162
01:54:59,770 --> 01:55:01,451
You are my creator

1163
01:55:01,451 --> 01:55:03,571
Don't rip me apart with your own hands

1164
01:55:03,651 --> 01:55:05,011
Forgive me and let me go

1165
01:55:05,051 --> 01:55:06,050
Please

1166
01:55:06,091 --> 01:55:07,131
Fat hopes!

1167
01:55:08,451 --> 01:55:09,772
Vasi...!

1168
01:55:55,897 --> 01:55:57,378
Come, you selfie bots!

1169
01:55:58,137 --> 01:56:00,138
I will set your screens on fire

1170
01:56:35,782 --> 01:56:37,301
Zero balance!

1171
01:57:20,067 --> 01:57:21,827
Shoot that sparrow

1172
01:59:55,782 --> 01:59:58,022
Hey bird man!

1173
02:00:00,943 --> 02:00:02,703
Iron man!

1174
02:00:03,022 --> 02:00:04,783
I'm just a driver
Let me go

1175
02:00:42,070 --> 02:00:43,230
Pakshi!

1176
02:00:43,431 --> 02:00:45,550
You had better scatter
and scoot from here

1177
02:00:45,630 --> 02:00:48,472
Otherwise I'll pluck
every single feather out

1178
02:00:51,311 --> 02:00:53,152
You moron of a machine!

1179
02:00:53,231 --> 02:00:56,113
Why are you fighting
for these ungrateful men?

1180
02:00:56,153 --> 02:00:59,713
When you've served their purpose
they will rip your nuts apart!

1181
02:04:03,905 --> 02:04:05,586
Hey! What's happening?

1182
02:04:24,870 --> 02:04:26,910
Yayayay...angry bird!

1183
02:04:27,590 --> 02:04:28,831
Why are you staring?

1184
02:04:28,871 --> 02:04:30,111
I am Kutti!

1185
02:04:30,190 --> 02:04:31,431
The microbot

1186
02:04:31,472 --> 02:04:33,512
Version 3.O

1187
02:04:34,872 --> 02:04:37,432
If you disturb my boss
your dove will be

1188
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:42,673
"I am Isaac Asimov’s grandson, buddy"

1189
02:04:42,713 --> 02:04:46,033
"I am a warrior, size of a turkey berry"

1190
02:04:52,635 --> 02:04:55,916
"O bird of prey
You’re a goner, I say"

1191
02:04:56,036 --> 02:04:59,156
"It's 'Festival of lights' for us today"

1192
02:05:00,956 --> 02:05:03,557
It is said a bird can look
in 6 different directions

1193
02:05:03,637 --> 02:05:05,637
Pakshi, won't you see?

1194
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:22,640
Microbots

1195
02:05:29,001 --> 02:05:30,122
No...no

1196
02:05:30,282 --> 02:05:32,001
Hey! Don't do this

1197
02:05:40,124 --> 02:05:42,203
Maintain that same panic

1198
02:05:46,965 --> 02:05:49,044
"Birdie got caught-o?"

1199
02:05:49,565 --> 02:05:50,446
Bow bow

1200
02:05:50,485 --> 02:05:51,966
"Feathers fell apart-o?"

1201
02:05:52,006 --> 02:05:53,086
"3.O"

1202
02:05:53,566 --> 02:05:55,526
"Swarmed all over you?"

1203
02:06:00,007 --> 02:06:03,727
Pakshi, if you breach this stadium
with your radiation

1204
02:06:03,768 --> 02:06:06,808
...1st victims will be
only your birdies!

1205
02:06:18,183 --> 02:06:19,783
Microbots, go

1206
02:06:22,343 --> 02:06:23,863
"3.O"

1207
02:06:29,183 --> 02:06:30,423
"3.O"

1208
02:06:52,393 --> 02:06:55,553
"I am a cannon 6" tall
You're a radish, that's all"

1209
02:06:55,633 --> 02:06:58,833
"I am an automated masterpiece
I tricked you with zetabyte-ease"

1210
02:06:58,913 --> 02:07:02,353
"I am the evil mosquito Ranguski
Ready to send you to the cemetery"

1211
02:07:02,393 --> 02:07:05,913
"Itsy-bitsy, I'm snuff powder heady
I'm into your nostril, deal with me"

1212
02:07:08,913 --> 02:07:11,753
A lion can't touch a mosquito, big birdie!

1213
02:07:11,953 --> 02:07:15,553
But if mosquitoes set their minds
they can chase the lion to its doom

1214
02:07:19,273 --> 02:07:20,633
Cuckoo!

1215
02:07:30,803 --> 02:07:32,203
Good job, 3.O

1216
02:07:33,643 --> 02:07:34,803
Thank you, commander

1217
02:07:34,843 --> 02:07:36,763
- Microbots positioned?
- All set

1218
02:07:37,323 --> 02:07:38,403
Pakshi

1219
02:07:42,283 --> 02:07:43,763
Have a blast!

1220
02:08:26,573 --> 02:08:28,733
Should these doves also explode?

1221
02:08:29,733 --> 02:08:32,053
Hey beep
Follow me

1222
02:08:33,293 --> 02:08:34,853
Come on, bots

1223
02:08:50,813 --> 02:08:53,813
"O eagle, you're a goner, I say"

1224
02:08:53,853 --> 02:08:57,133
"It's 'Conquest of good over evil' today"

1225
02:08:57,253 --> 02:09:00,533
"Bird of prey
It's a jolly day"

1226
02:09:00,573 --> 02:09:03,733
"You are a guest in hell any which way"

1227
02:09:03,813 --> 02:09:07,293
"People’s favorite
'Podimas' minuute"

1228
02:09:07,333 --> 02:09:10,213
"If I burst, it will be a wrecker
like a boom-boom cracker"

1229
02:09:10,253 --> 02:09:12,533
Hey! Who are you?
What are you doing here?

1230
02:09:12,573 --> 02:09:13,533
This is restricted area

1231
02:09:13,573 --> 02:09:14,533
Get out!

1232
02:10:20,982 --> 02:10:25,065
You are the reason
we are alive once again today

1233
02:10:25,344 --> 02:10:28,307
What an enormous risk you've taken
and saved all of us!

1234
02:10:28,346 --> 02:10:30,388
Technology saved us

1235
02:10:31,069 --> 02:10:34,270
But we are the ones
misusing technology

1236
02:10:35,110 --> 02:10:37,673
We should eliminate diseases
with the help of technology

1237
02:10:37,753 --> 02:10:38,994
Eradicate poverty

1238
02:10:38,994 --> 02:10:40,635
Promote education

1239
02:10:40,635 --> 02:10:45,238
If we use it for personal comforts and
fuelling our greed, it's doomsday for sure

1240
02:10:45,997 --> 02:10:48,680
Will...will that Pakshi Rajan reappear?

1241
02:10:50,561 --> 02:10:52,362
He is dead and gone

1242
02:10:52,562 --> 02:10:56,405
But if we continue this way
another 'evil force' will erupt

1243
02:10:57,605 --> 02:11:00,207
Even if Pakshi Rajan's actions were wrong

1244
02:11:00,287 --> 02:11:02,049
...there was truth in his words

1245
02:11:02,248 --> 02:11:06,132
If human beings should live on earth
birds should also co exist

1246
02:11:07,412 --> 02:11:09,333
Control radiation

1247
02:11:09,533 --> 02:11:11,534
Reduce networks

1248
02:11:11,534 --> 02:11:17,538
Pass a rule, no technology should affect
any living thing, human, bird or beast

1249
02:11:18,058 --> 02:11:20,380
This earth doesn't belong only to us

1250
02:11:20,620 --> 02:11:24,823
Everyone should realize it belongs
to all the living creatures here

1251
02:11:25,544 --> 02:11:26,744
You are right

1252
02:11:26,865 --> 02:11:28,706
Ensure birds are not destroyed

1253
02:11:28,865 --> 02:11:33,829
At least provide water for birds
to drink during our scorching summers

1254
02:11:35,149 --> 02:11:37,792
That’s enough to refresh
and revitalize your minds

1255
02:11:38,192 --> 02:11:40,273
All this will happen, Vaseegaran

1256
02:11:40,354 --> 02:11:42,955
I'll bring this to the notice
of our Parliament

1257
02:11:43,115 --> 02:11:45,476
I'll make sure this happens

1258
02:11:46,156 --> 02:11:47,638
Thank you, Vaseegaran

1259
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:53,322
Thanks, Nila

1260
02:11:53,442 --> 02:11:55,323
Why are you thanking your shadow?

1261
02:11:57,924 --> 02:11:59,326
Oh God!

1262
02:11:59,485 --> 02:12:01,886
We have to remove
that red chip from Chitti

1263
02:12:01,968 --> 02:12:03,087
Don't worry, boss

1264
02:12:03,169 --> 02:12:07,170
To be on the safe side I activated it
after doing an auto-eject program

1265
02:12:08,932 --> 02:12:10,172
Smaaart!

1266
02:12:16,977 --> 02:12:19,099
Good to see you alright, doctor

1267
02:12:19,298 --> 02:12:20,579
Me too, Chitti

1268
02:12:20,659 --> 02:12:24,822
Doctor, all the robots and I have to
report in the headquarters at Delhi today

1269
02:12:24,862 --> 02:12:26,663
Can I leave, doctor?

1270
02:12:30,345 --> 02:12:31,987
Take Nila with you

1271
02:12:38,551 --> 02:12:40,552
Doctor, how can I leave you like this and-

1272
02:12:40,672 --> 02:12:42,113
I can take care of myself

1273
02:12:42,194 --> 02:12:43,674
