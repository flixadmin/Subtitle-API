1
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:09,259
Oh, you got to really
get it up in there, dawg.

2
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:14,848
<i>Some sins
deserve eternal damnation.</i>

3
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:16,642
I've committed murders.

4
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,227
Inmate refused visitation.

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,311
No!

6
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,690
A panic attack.
Whatever you're doing, stop it.

7
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,574
<i>They killed
Cameron Coleman because</i>

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,712
<i>they thought that he was
the fucking leak. I'm done.</i>

9
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,404
Cameron Coleman wasn't the leak.

10
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,198
So, either Sage was lying to you,

11
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,158
<i>or she's as useless as tits on a mouse.</i>

12
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:34,785
I'd do anything for you.

13
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:36,745
That's my boy.

14
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,538
I hate you.

15
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,082
Kimiko!

16
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,435
Victoria here,
she's an integral part of the plan.

17
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,254
<i>We'll handle Singer
after the election's certified.</i>

18
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,631
We need plausible deniability
when the 25th is invoked.

19
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,758
You're talking about a coup.

20
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:53,303
You give us a list of what
you need to extract the virus, and make it

21
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:54,489
strong enough to top Homelander.

22
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:56,848
We're not just talking about
killing Homelander,

23
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,351
<i>we're talking about
killing every Supe on Earth.</i>

24
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,645
No one ever said nothing about genocide.

25
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,439
What the fuck's that supposed to mean,
"you're me"?

26
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:07,317
You got a big old fat
V'd-up brain tumor, you cunt,

27
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,820
which is why you are seeing me
in the first place.

28
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,530
I am you.

a resync

Well, Merry Christmas, A-Train!

61
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,346
Oh, Merry Christmas, Ryan.

62
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,641
Why the long face?

63
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,686
Antifa.

64
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,104
What's that?

65
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,273
Well, Ryan, it's a word for people

66
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,400
who hate superheroes and America

67
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,861
even more than they hate Christmas.

68
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,104
Well, what do they look like?

69
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,781
That's the problem.
They can look like anyone,

70
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:58,910
your neighbors, your teachers,
even your mom and dad.

71
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,434
Uh, Tommy, can we cut out for a second?

72
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,102
Uh, that's a cut on rehearsal.

73
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,371
That's a cut.

74
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,772
Back in 20, everyone.

75
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,398
Hey, is everything okay?

76
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,522
I mean, yeah, it's just...

77
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,651
we're telling kids to
report on their own parents.

78
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:36,239
The lyrics were approved
by your dad. Personally, so...

79
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,367
Right. Right, yeah, yeah.

80
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,202
- Right.
- Yeah. It's no problem.

81
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,620
Uh...

82
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,831
I just need to go 10-1.

83
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,125
Yeah.

84
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,592
PR made that apology
to Temple Beth El,

85
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,070
so that should be a done fucking deal.

86
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,262
Um, secondly, we've got a...

87
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,973
I thought the meeting started at 11:00.

88
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,268
We moved it up.

89
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,937
Hmm.

90
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,439
Um, next.

91
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,192
Oh, marketing would like to
start selling these NFTs of you.

92
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,862
Apparently, you're not just buying JPEGs,
you're joining a community.

93
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,114
- Ashley.
- Yes, sir?

94
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,448
- Get out.
- Yes, sir.

95
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,450
Sorry, sir. Yes, absolutely.

96
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,210
Sage...

97
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,461
who's the leak?

98
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,963
We're making inquiries.

99
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,590
It's a process, we're eliminating...

100
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,999
I assume you know what that is.

101
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,806
- It's a bug.
- Specifically William Butcher's bug.

102
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:47,352
They probably heard every single word
we said at Tek-Knight's.

103
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,812
And likely killed him.

104
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,856
They won't go public with the information.

105
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,779
- And why not?
- Because it would short-circuit

106
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:53,942
everything they really want,

107
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,778
which is to quietly take out Neuman
once and for all.

108
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,699
We should slaughter Butcher
and his whole fucking team.

109
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:01,992
Now that is a great idea, sir.

110
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,328
Butcher will be dead
in a few months anyway.

111
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,165
And this close to go-time,
I wouldn't stir up shit with the CIA.

112
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,917
Yes, yes, yes.
Your illustrious fucking plan.

113
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,503
We killed Cameron Coleman for no reason.

114
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,922
A speed bump but, ultimately, harmless.

115
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,757
Cameron golfed with Mike Lindell,

116
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,552
who just pulled 50 million bucks
worth of pillow commercials.

117
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:21,678
You call that harmless?

118
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,848
Oh, look at Daisy Duck Dynasty doing math.

119
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,184
You know, Firecracker and I
have been talking.

120
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,352
Stimulating, I'm sure.

121
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,480
Sorry.

122
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,191
You have brains, Sage,

123
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,317
but I have wisdom.

124
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,988
And what happens if those brains of yours

125
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,617
get blown out again, leaving you

126
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,118
talking like a gibbering idiot?

127
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,665
Firecracker and I will find the leak.

128
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:51,809
With respect, the last time...

129
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,628
Respect? I don't hear no fucking respect.

130
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,546
In fact, I am personally offended

131
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,049
by the way you are talking to
this great man.

132
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,636
You just
focus on the shooter,

133
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,138
make sure he's good to go on the sixth.

134
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,890
He'll be ready.

135
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,683
Good.

136
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,519
You may leave.

137
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,191
This one's called <i>The World's Our Oyster.</i>

138
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,653
"Shimmering forests of kelp

139
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,321
Like nature's car wash brushes

140
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,574
At the dark bottom, jellyfish glow

141
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,368
Like frat house lava lamps

142
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,537
I can swim you anywhere

143
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,414
The seven seas, one big wet road."

144
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,499
Jesus, Kevin.

145
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,710
You really have the soul of a poet.

146
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,296
Stop.

147
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,673
You're so bad.

148
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,466
And, God, your tongue

149
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,385
- is like an outboard motor.
- Yeah?

150
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,595
I came so many times.

151
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,514
Really?

152
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,029
I, uh, I got to go, babe.

153
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,322
What? You do?

154
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:05,824
Duty calls.

155
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,410
Wait. No, no. Wait.

156
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,162
Come on, babe. You know you can't
be out of water for long.

157
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,916
No, you promised me you'd
move me into the tank above the bed.

158
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,502
Right, no. Of course, babe.
A hunny percent.

159
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:21,506
I just got to, uh, you know,
clear out the freshwater exotics first,

160
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,174
and then it'll be all set.

161
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,719
Oh, and I got a notes call with Shia

162
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,471
on his new draft of <i>Honey Boy 2.</i>
It's really starting to sing.

163
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,140
Well, can I move in tomorrow?

164
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,933
Yeah, totally.

165
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,227
<i>Just like that,
I'm supposed to pick up and leave?</i>

166
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,688
<i>Christmas in the desert. Terrific.</i>

167
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:40,150
You're safer with Gen
in Sedona, okay?

168
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:44,112
- Some... things might happen soon.
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

169
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,572
<i>What... what kind of things?</i>

170
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,699
It's better you don't know.

171
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,909
<i>- You call me out of the blue...</i>
- I have called you

172
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:53,371
every day for weeks.
This is the first time you've picked up.

173
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,207
<i>You know, they kicked me out
of the Tuesday Bible group.</i>

174
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,811
- That has nothing to do with me.
<i>- No?</i>

175
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,756
<i>Well, I heard Shelly whisper,
"How the heck did Donna raise that girl?"</i>

176
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:04,257
Okay, just hit the road
first thing tomorrow...

177
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,884
<i>"That she would have an abortion?"</i>

178
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,765
<i>You're supposed to be
held to a higher standard.</i>

179
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,350
<i>That's how I raised you.</i>

180
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,352
<i>Girls all over the world look up to you.</i>

181
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,331
<i>And now they think they can be loose,
because there's no consequences...</i>

182
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,939
That is none of your business,

183
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,942
and it sure as fuck isn't Shelly's.

184
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,861
<i>You're Starlight. You're a superhero.</i>

185
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,196
I'm a person.

186
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,908
Right now, none of that
Starlight shit matters.

187
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,786
<i>Then why did Hughie save the suit?</i>

188
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,417
I am so, so sorry.

189
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,545
That is so fucked.

190
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,689
I pulled it from the trash.

191
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,733
I mean, I thought you might
regret tossing it someday.

192
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,133
I don't even like looking at it.

193
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,761
Okay. All right.

194
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,138
Done. I am... There it goes.

195
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:55,058
It is...

196
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,768
out of here.

197
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,066
I just...

198
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,527
God. I just, I didn't...

199
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:10,115
want to bring a baby into
a world that's ending.

200
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,496
Hughie. It's just...

201
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,709
...it's just all too much.

202
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:24,838
I mean, there are
so many fucking dumpster fires.

203
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:25,922
Mm-hmm.

204
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,841
Where do we even start?

205
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,885
We just take it step by step.

206
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,349
<i>You smell like
you've been drinking.</i>

207
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,952
I don't know what
you want from me, all right?

208
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,954
- I got here as fast as I could...
- I want you to do your fucking job.

209
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,272
Whatever.

210
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,254
You really think
this could be our Lee Harvey?

211
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,406
That's what A-Train says.
I say we visit him, too.

212
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,472
Where the fuck you been?

213
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,165
Shittin' a kidney.

214
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,042
All right, listen up.

215
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,587
Now, don't get
your knickers in a twist, but...

216
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:10,467
...you remember Neuman's dearly departed

217
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,470
virus bloke? Dr. Sameer Shah?

218
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,430
I'm serious, Butcher. Don't.

219
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,058
Well, funny story.

220
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,810
Turns out he ain't that dead.

221
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,565
He's been working for me,
making some more of that virus.

222
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,816
What the fuck?

223
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,568
Wait, all they found was...

224
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,779
- Goddamn it, you asshole.
- Did you cut off his leg?

225
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,462
All right, all right, keep your hair on.

226
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,591
So, basically,

227
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,408
you've been amputatin' motherfuckers

228
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,243
while working on a secret bioweapon,

229
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,013
and we're the ones
that are supposed to chill?

230
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,538
You are pissing away our best shot.

231
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,382
Now, the trouble is,
we've hit a slight snag.

232
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,876
He can't make it deadly enough
to top Homelander

233
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,169
without causing a, you know,

234
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,338
global pandemic.

235
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,506
Jesus.

236
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,590
Wait.

237
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,718
Genocide.

238
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,262
You're talking about Supe genocide.
That's...

239
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,681
Yeah, Butcher, even for you...

240
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,059
Which is why
I'm fucking telling you, innit?

241
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,828
You think I want
that much blood on me hands?

242
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,438
Yeah, you do.
You want to fucking swim in it.

243
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,564
No, I don't.

244
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,568
No, I do not.

245
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,614
So, to keep the bug from
burning through you lot like wildfire,

246
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,699
I thought ol' Sameer could do with

247
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:17,951
- a bit of a hand.
- From who?

248
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,830
A question both insightful
and germane, my son.

249
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:27,418
Ah, here he is. Speak of the devil.

250
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,840
<i>Bonjour.</i>

251
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,359
How the fuck
did you get out?

252
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,385
I had Mallory pull a few strings.

253
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,530
Just to be clear,

254
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,681
this was against my will.

255
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:44,644
I'd rather fuck a jar of fishing lures
than to be free.

256
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,854
Oh, cool. Cool.

257
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:46,977
All right, then.

258
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,357
Happy reunions. So,

259
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,277
Frenchie will help sort the virus.

260
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,530
We'll use it on Homelander
and the VP and that's it, no one else.

261
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,035
You fucking coward.

262
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,372
Okay, that works.

263
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,584
Kimiko, Frenchie, you two are on Dr. Shah.

264
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,460
The rest of you, on the mystery man.

265
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,993
"Don't be a cunt."

266
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,851
Listen...

267
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,353
You should... go on ahead.

268
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,479
You what?

269
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,106
Without me.
I gotta talk to Monique. It's...

270
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,566
Oh, come off it.

271
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,234
Don't leave me alone with this lot.

272
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:16,653
Wait, what?

273
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,464
- He ain't going.
- You're not going? Why?

274
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,281
All right, so we gonna make this official?

275
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,866
Take a knee,

276
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,284
I'll knight you with my dick.

277
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,536
You're back in charge
of The Boys again, all right?

278
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,747
I'm better off doing research anyway.

279
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,957
No, you can't do this.

280
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,375
You don't got to do this.

281
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,502
Yeah, he does. This is good for us.

282
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,295
You can't. Things are bad already

283
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:35,739
without this fucking asshole back.

284
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,590
Look what I got to deal with.

285
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,114
Listen, it ain't a debate, you guys.

286
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,010
I passed out.

287
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,720
During a mission.

288
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,973
I ain't cut out to be skipper.

289
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,141
But he is.

290
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,352
So, it's him. It's you.

291
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,563
End of story.

292
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,993
Hey, come in, baby.

293
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,369
Okay, babe...

294
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,413
Here, take this.

295
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,747
That's $10,000 cash.

296
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,642
The rest of my accounts,
I transferred into yours.

297
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,792
Marvin...

298
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,061
Here's two one-way tickets to Belize.

299
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,396
You and Janine's flights are tonight.

300
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,629
Now, it's not forever,

301
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,798
- just until things blow over.
- Stop.

302
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,633
Just stop.

303
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,011
Okay? Tell me what's wrong.

304
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,846
Something big's about to go down.

305
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,390
If we lose, shit's gonna get crazy.

306
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,350
If we win, shit's gonna get even crazier,

307
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,852
so either way, y'all got to go.

308
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,688
And I'm sorry to make you have to
pick up and leave again,

309
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,898
but I got one fucking job to do,

310
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,901
and that's to keep you and Janine safe,

311
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,195
and I'll be damned if
I let any of this fucking sh...

312
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,791
I know how hard you try, Marvin,

313
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,669
taking care of Janine and me.

314
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,673
Come with us.

315
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,425
I believe you.

316
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,594
If you did all this, I...

317
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,306
...I'm sure it's even worse
than I'm imagining.

318
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,141
So let's go.

319
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,769
The three of us, let's go be a family.

320
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,190
Monique...

321
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,692
you know that you and Janine are my heart,

322
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,069
right?

323
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,487
- I can't.
- Look at you.

324
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,573
That panic attack was
supposed to be a warning, Marvin.

325
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,658
Meet us at the airport...

326
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,913
...and this time tomorrow,

327
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,664
baby, we'll be sipping rum punches

328
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:36,918
on the beach
while Janine dodges the waves.

329
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:49,222
{\an8}<i>For over a decade,
one man has been a voice you can trust.</i>

330
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,140
<i>And now that voice is gone.</i>

331
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,726
<i>Cameron Coleman has died
of a brain aneurism</i>

332
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,145
<i>as a direct result of the flu vaccine.</i>

333
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,857
<i>Gone from this world,
but never gone from our hearts.</i>

334
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,501
<i>Once again, tragedy...</i>

335
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:07,073
- Hey. What happened to your assistant?
- Oh, Gregory? I fired him.

336
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,884
Dumb fuck could never get
my Sweetgreen order right.

337
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:09,909
What do you want?

338
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,869
Listen. They know Cameron's not the leak...

339
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:14,997
Shut the fuck up.
I don't want to hear that shit anymore.

340
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,201
You leave me the fuck out of that.
I'm done.

341
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,377
You're shitfaced?

342
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,587
I am still the CEO of this company,

343
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:26,300
and if the CEO wants
to get shitfaced at 11:00 a.m., I can.

344
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,095
He was the best.

345
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,889
He was the fucking best assistant
I ever fucking had.

346
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:35,685
And I fired him to get him away
from this fucking place.

347
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,770
I had Cameron killed.
I had him killed.

348
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,313
Look, you saved my life.

349
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,816
I could've done that some other way.

350
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,901
He didn't have to die.

351
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:47,989
It's-it's so easy to become
a monster around here.

352
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,576
What if we left? Huh?

353
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,871
What if we left?

354
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,581
You and me?

355
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,210
I don't mean us fucking... ew, no.

356
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,839
I spent my junior year abroad in Florence,
we could just go, we could go.

357
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,299
- You have a passport.
- All right.

358
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,062
- Oh, you don't need a passport. You just run...
- Hey, Ashley. Ashley.

359
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,344
Get your shit together.

360
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:14,557
Okay? You cannot be all wasted
running your fucking mouth,

361
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,101
not when you have
both of our lives in your fucking hands.

362
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,936
Button it up.

363
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,188
Now.

364
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,461
All right. I'll have a dekko
around the back,

365
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,795
you two take the front, yeah?

366
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,756
And then we'll pay the shooter a visit.

367
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:07,068
You know,
I have been racking my brain...

368
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,738
trying to figure out when you got
this soft spot for Supes.

369
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:16,118
Was it when you shot your load
and cream-pied Maeve?

370
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,206
All right, you know what?

371
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,541
Enough with the silent treatment,
you stubborn prick,

372
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,002
I am done fucking around with you.

373
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:28,005
See, I know you don't care
about Starlight or Kimiko.

374
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,758
Not really. And Ryan?

375
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,885
He's not even yours.

376
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,805
So, tell me...

377
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,640
what justifies the faith in the kid?

378
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,561
I gave her my word.

379
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,106
Becca? Really?

380
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,067
If your love was so perfect and pure...

381
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,445
...then why'd you fuck that waitress?

382
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,328
I fucked up, all right.

383
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,831
And I quit the booze
the next day, didn't I?

384
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,291
Yeah.

385
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:06,419
I can't help but notice you've been
quitting the quitting lately.

386
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:10,381
You know, you keep saying that you're
doing all this to honor Becca's memory.

387
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,883
You never did that when she was alive.

388
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,138
So, don't you think
it's time to cut the shit?

389
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,349
Fuck off, cunt.

390
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,628
All clear.

391
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:53,674
Except for literal used tampons
in the toilet.

392
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,597
Guys...
Secret Service files.

393
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,476
- Detail assignments for January 6th.
- What?

394
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,276
Whoa.

395
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,530
It's a map of the D.C. Fairgrounds
where Singer's having his rally.

396
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,241
That's where they're giving him
the old Dealey Plaza.

397
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,409
M was right.

398
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,393
Oh, my God.

399
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,772
Oh, thank God you're here.

400
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,899
He killed my husband.

401
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,692
He held me for days.

402
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,945
Wait.

403
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,738
Are you...?

404
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,407
Um...

405
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,450
Yeah. Yeah, hi.

406
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,910
Um...

407
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:08,457
Oh, my God. You are... burning up.
Are you okay?

408
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,875
It's like a furnace in there.

409
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,378
Okay. Let's get you some help. Yeah?

410
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,838
Come on.

411
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,047
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

412
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,674
Fuck! Stop!

413
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,715
Oi!

414
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,243
What the fuck?

415
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,786
So gross. Ugh!

416
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:22,615
Fuck!

417
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,575
- Do you see anything?
- No.

418
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,703
Fucking Supe shapeshifters.

419
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:29,788
I hate those cunts.

420
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,166
Got to hand it to Sage though...

421
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,792
perfect choice for the job.

422
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,354
Wait, wait, wait. So we're saying
that they could be anyone?

423
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,380
How the fuck are we supposed
to save the president

424
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,757
if the killer could be anyone?

425
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,635
By not shitting our panties.

426
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,013
Hughie, wait a minute.

427
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,599
Oh, my God. You need stitches.

428
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,726
- I'll go to urgent care, okay?
- I'll go with you.

429
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,979
No, no, um, go back up there,
get those plans before...

430
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,790
whoever gets back, all right?
I'll catch up with you later.

431
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,107
- Okay. I love you.
- Love you.

432
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,119
Printed-out boarding pass?

433
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:10,496
Damn, what are you, 87?

434
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,830
The fuck are you doing here?

435
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,433
You took the words right out of my mouth.

436
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,709
See, I ran by that shithole earlier.

437
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:19,213
I saw Butcher, Hughie
and Starlight going in.

438
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,423
But one motherfucker
was conspicuously absent.

439
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,805
So... this is it?

440
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,392
You think I don't want
to just peace out to Belize,

441
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,394
sip a daiquiri, smash the local talent?

442
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,145
Get on Priceline then, motherfucker.

443
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:37,481
Hey. This shit ain't over.

444
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,066
It's over for me.

445
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,361
I've given enough.

446
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,655
Maybe I deserve to be fucking happy.

447
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,199
You know, when I carried your ass
to the ER,

448
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,909
there was a kid there.

449
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,538
His eyes were like...

450
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,872
"Holy shit."

451
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,377
Looking at me...

452
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,796
...like I was a hero.

453
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:05,175
There were no screaming fans, no cameras.

454
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,595
Nobody even knew.

455
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,639
Except for this one kid.

456
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:14,768
That felt better than anything
that I'd ever done at Vought.

457
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,230
Because for once...

458
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,441
I didn't hate myself.

459
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,530
That's on you.

460
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,412
A-Train, you don't get it, do you, man?

461
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,540
This fight that we're in?

462
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,917
This never fucking ends.

463
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:42,504
It killed my father. It killed his father.

464
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:45,007
And look at what it's doing to me.

465
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,136
It's tearing me the fuck apart.

466
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,721
Just like it did them.

467
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:54,600
You know, I look in the mirror...

468
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,685
and I don't even see myself no more.

469
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,067
I got nothing left.

470
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,404
Except my family.

471
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,329
You think Homelander and Vought...

472
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,667
...and all of this shit
ain't coming to Belize?

473
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,294
This whole fucking world?

474
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,506
Where's your family gonna go then?

475
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:53,659
Thanks.

476
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,078
After you eat,

477
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,539
we'll adjust your centrifugation numbers.

478
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,751
I think <i>peut-être</i> we should try
a glycerol gradient.

479
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,753
This, uh...

480
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,297
quote-unquote "lab"
can't produce what he wants.

481
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:08,799
What we all want.

482
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,427
Homelander... <i>fini,</i>
do we not?

483
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,473
You know, you worked in
the finest lab with the best equipment,

484
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,016
but <i>moi?</i>

485
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,561
I have worked in filthy basements
with equipment

486
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,771
from dumpsters and dollar stores.

487
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:27,359
Necessity is the MILF of invention.

488
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:30,529
You know, um, he would talk to people
who weren't here.

489
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:33,991
Your friend.

490
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,289
Some music, perhaps?

491
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:44,585
I noticed you enjoy truly revolting
garbage from the 1990s.

492
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,047
Help you work.

493
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:51,467
Bon appétit.

494
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,177
This virus.

495
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,722
It's just for Homelander, right?
Not for Vicky?

496
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,645
Ryan, it's Dad.

497
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,231
Hey, listen, buddy, I-I'm sorry
I've been so busy lately,

498
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,734
but I hear you're having some issues

499
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,402
with the-the puppet show thing.

500
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,029
Um, look, I got a lot going on here,

501
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,947
buddy, so, uh, do me a favor,

502
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:17,284
just-just-just suck it up
and-and do it, all right? For me.

503
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,036
Terrific. Love you. Great. Bye.

504
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,288
Are you absolutely sure

505
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,916
that he is the leak?

506
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,461
The little shit broke wide open.
He confessed to everything.

507
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:37,888
- Sir.
- Webweaver.

508
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:41,016
Ew, what the fuck?

509
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,019
- Ew.
- I'm sorry.

510
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,312
Happens when I'm nervous.

511
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,648
- Oh, fuck.
- Ain't got to be nervous, just...

512
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,900
go on, tell him what you told me. I know.

513
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,485
Yes, ma'am.

514
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,986
Yes, sir.

515
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,238
Whatever you want to know.

516
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,864
How does it work?

517
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,200
There's a hole in the suit
so the webs can get out...

518
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,370
No. No. How does it work
with William Butcher?

519
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,122
Yeah, well, uh... He-he...

520
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,416
he comes to me.

521
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,168
I tell him what he wants to know.

522
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,255
Oh, for God sakes.

523
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,719
- That's just embarrassing.
- Just shut the fuck up.

524
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,555
Now, one of Butcher's crew

525
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,598
was wearing your nasty-ass suit
to Tek-Knight's.

526
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:23,100
Did you give it to them?

527
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,811
I'm not proud of it.

528
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,313
There it is.

529
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:32,669
Help me out with something here.

530
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:34,361
Few weeks back,

531
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,464
how did you know where
I was meeting Victoria Neuman?

532
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,740
Look, I-I messed up. I know, I know...

533
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,327
I'm sorry.

534
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:46,874
I...

535
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:48,584
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

536
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,670
I... I don't feel very good.

537
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,339
You ever meet this British guy?

538
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:57,009
- He's a liar.
- Hmm.

539
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,176
He fucks with your brain.

540
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,262
- Feeble brains, maybe.
- Yes.

541
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,265
Feeble. I'm all fucked up.

542
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,684
I screwed you.

543
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,478
I'm so, so sorry.

544
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:11,815
I'll make you proud. I swear to God.

545
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,401
Hmm.

546
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,696
Oh, buddy, what am I gonna do with you?

547
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,031
Hmm?

548
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,657
Jesus.

549
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,075
Oh, stop.

550
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,913
Wait, wait!

551
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,205
What?

552
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:28,790
It wasn't me.

553
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:33,545
No, please.

554
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,309
Thank you, Firecracker.

555
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,856
You bet.

556
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,743
For Noel.

557
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,119
It's not much.

558
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:15,837
I've missed you.

559
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:25,263
I came every day. You wouldn't see me.

560
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,600
I was ashamed.

561
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:32,562
For what you did to Colin and his family.

562
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:39,194
You told a lot to Annie.
The rest I pieced together.

563
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,739
Then you know why I had to turn myself in.

564
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,202
You're exhausting.

565
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,285
Sorry.

566
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,330
You always do this. All moody.

567
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:51,540
Torturing yourself.

568
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:52,958
What else was I supposed to do?

569
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:56,503
- Ask for help. Come to me for help.
- You can't help.

570
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,088
You don't understand.

571
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:05,887
Do you know why I can't speak?

572
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,098
You watched Shining Light
kill your parents.

573
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,891
Your brother told me.

574
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:16,815
I never told Kenji the truth.

575
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:20,610
It was my first night at the camp.

576
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:25,574
We move like ghosts.

577
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,491
In silence.

578
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,534
So will you.

579
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:30,829
So the first girl to cry out?

580
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,663
She loses.

581
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:37,461
You ready?

582
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,522
I murdered her without making a sound.

583
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:10,118
Then when I was allowed to speak again...

584
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:11,744
I couldn't.

585
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,294
You did not have a choice.

586
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,297
Of course I did.

587
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:27,385
Better they kill me,
than what I did to that girl.

588
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,137
What I did to lots of girls.

589
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:43,610
I look in the mirror and hate what I see.

590
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,988
So I understand,

591
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:50,408
more than you know.

592
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,327
You should not hate yourself.

593
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:56,873
Then neither should you.

594
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:13,640
How can we possibly forgive ourselves?

595
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,019
How can we move on?

596
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:35,245
When the virus is ready,
we should set him free, no?

597
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,751
Butcher won't be happy.

598
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:45,463
Then it must be the right thing to do.

599
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:53,763
Babe, that you?

600
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:54,890
Yeah, babe.

601
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,184
Can you pick me up
some Sugarfish?

602
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:58,768
No. We've talked about this.

603
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,770
I can't take part
in the slaughter of albacore.

604
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,480
One of my ride-or-dies is an albacore.

605
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:05,358
Okay,
so I don't get to stay where I want

606
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:06,860
or eat what I want.

607
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,379
What's that supposed to mean?

608
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,822
"Sometimes the way you get them
is the way you lose them."

609
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,365
Why are you quoting Lisa Vanderpump?

610
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:15,493
I know about Sage.

611
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,915
What are you talking about? Sage?

612
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,376
Don't patronize me, Kevin.
I've known for a while.

613
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,462
My suckers can smell her on you

614
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,088
after your trysts.

615
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,382
Like the one you're coming from now.

616
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,009
I love you so much.

617
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:34,262
Your gentle heart, your fearless writing.

618
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,473
Can you honestly say she feels the same?

619
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,825
Look, I don't know
what to tell you right now.

620
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,392
Try the truth.

621
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:40,644
It's not too late.

622
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,479
This is worth fighting for.

623
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,897
We're worth fighting for.

624
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,816
There's no way Sage
cares about you the way that I do.

625
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,069
She says that I'm a superior being,

626
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,779
and she has four limbs.

627
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,572
That is not fair.

628
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:53,990
Yeah, well, it is what it is.

629
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,617
That's a dumb, nothing phrase,

630
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,993
- spoken by...
- Dumb people?

631
00:33:57,077 --> 00:34:00,789
Dumb people? I hate it when you get nasty.

632
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,934
Well, what choice do I have,
when you're rubbing my face in it?

633
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,794
Oh, what, that I'm happy for once?!

634
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,546
- I'm sorry!
- I feel sorry for you.

635
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,966
For me? For me? Look at you.

636
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,219
You won't be laughing when you realize
she doesn't respect you.

637
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,845
She does respect me!

638
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,682
Wake up, Kevin. She's using you.

639
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,326
- You shut the fuck up!
- You're throwing us away for a woman

640
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,143
who thinks you're pathetic...

641
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,313
Kevin! Kevin!

642
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:26,606
Come back!

643
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,775
Please, Kevin, please.

644
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,569
Please, Kevin.

645
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:34,155
Kevin, I-I-I can't breathe.

646
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,548
- Please...
- What?

647
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,951
- Oh, my God.
- Kevin!

648
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,509
Please!

649
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,645
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

650
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,734
Kevin!

651
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,028
- Open the door!
- Fuck.

652
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,328
I love... you.

653
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,997
Okay.

654
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,284
Deep? Deep?

655
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,287
- Did you get all that?
- Yes, sir.

656
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:05,663
I finally have clarity now.

657
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:06,956
Good.

658
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,435
I will kill whoever you want me to kill,
whenever you want me to kill them.

659
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:12,587
I'll kill every goddamn fish
in the ocean if you say so.

660
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,343
Okay.

661
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,470
Attaboy. Um...

662
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:23,765
Well, get to it.

663
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,571
- Madam Vice President-elect?
- Yeah?

664
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,657
There's someone here to see you.

665
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,968
Fuck, I'm gonna miss New York bodegas.

666
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,511
Listen, we need to talk.

667
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,763
You can still stop all this, all right?
Just stop.

668
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:06,325
You must be pretty desperate if you're
throwing a Hail Mary like this. Jesus...

669
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,910
Five minutes, all right? Just five minutes

670
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,829
where we cut the bullshit and we talk,
just you and me,

671
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,396
about how fucked all this is.

672
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,857
What it is, is politics.
You know how it goes,

673
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,066
strange bedfellows.

674
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,253
Yeah, but it's not like you're
palling around with Mitt Romney.

675
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:18,517
You're working with Homelander.

676
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,155
He's gonna kill the president.

677
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,365
That sounds fucking insane
coming out of my mouth.

678
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,160
Wow.

679
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,372
And when Homelander
chucks all the Starlighters

680
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:30,856
into internment camps, you're just,

681
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,292
you're cool with that, too?

682
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:36,754
You didn't know about the camps.

683
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,133
Why do you think that
you were at Tek-Knight's?

684
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:43,178
- That's what his prisons are for.
- I got to get back to it.

685
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,598
I still have all the dirt on you.
What you said at Tek-Knight's.

686
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,807
Everything.

687
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:48,933
Is that a threat?

688
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:52,270
No.

689
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,273
Because when we drop it,
then you'll kill us all.

690
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,774
Like you said,
mutually assured destruction.

691
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,651
But it doesn't have to be that way.

692
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:01,046
And if you're even, like,
one percent of the person that I knew,

693
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,840
then I don't think
you really want to do this.

694
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,407
You can still step back.

695
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:05,742
Vic, it's not too late.

696
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,250
Thanks for coming by.

697
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,634
I'm sorry...

698
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,015
...to hear about your dad.

699
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:46,741
Hughie's still not answering.
I'm worried about him.

700
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,452
Sup, cum burgers?

701
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:53,248
The fuck you doing here?

702
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,208
Homelander is sick
of your shit, bro.

703
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,918
Said to put you out of your misery.

704
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,044
And he sent you?

705
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,883
Sure you ain't too busy
tongue lashing your octo-pussy?

706
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,343
What? No. I never...

707
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,388
He didn't just send me.

708
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:22,944
Do you know what?

709
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,196
I can't believe I'm saying this,

710
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,198
but it's Christmas.

711
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:31,703
You two twats leg it right now,

712
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,205
and we'll forget you was ever here.

713
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,541
What, dude?
I can barely understand you,

714
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,085
- your accent's insane.
- What the fuck do you want, Deep?

715
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:42,046
Justice, you fucking bitch.

716
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:45,633
God, I'm gonna enjoy this so much.

717
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,552
First, you tried to cancel me,

718
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,988
victimize an innocent man because I guess

719
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:50,573
that's just cool to do
to white guys nowadays.

720
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:53,099
But joke's on you. #MeToo's over,

721
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,892
sweetheart, it didn't work.

722
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,394
Wah-wah-wah.

723
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:59,647
I do not respect your truth.

724
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,191
I do not honor and cherish your story.

725
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:04,110
And I do not fucking apologize.

726
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,668
Cunt's narcoleptic.

727
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,682
Kessler,

728
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:19,102
whatever you did to Ezekiel,

729
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,395
do it again.

730
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,322
What are you doing?

731
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,703
Wait, are you... You're the leak?

732
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:38,454
Did he just talk?

733
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:41,290
Bro, it was you, bro?

734
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:43,668
Deep, just FYI, I have always,

735
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,504
always fucking hated your ass.

736
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:51,384
Fuck, he can fly?

737
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,886
Eat a flying dick, motherfuck...

738
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,399
Ah!

739
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,192
Noir will be back up here
in no time, so let's go.

740
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,527
He's right fucking there. Let's do him.

741
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:53,654
You know how, Butcher? 'Cause I don't,

742
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:56,532
but Noir sure as hell's gonna know
how to fucking kill us.

743
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:58,201
Now, come the fuck on.

744
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,879
Alexa, play "Dave Matthews Chill Mix."

745
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,715
<i>- Playing Dave Matthews...</i>
- Alexa, please fucking don't.

746
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:13,925
What the fuck, A-Train?

747
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,843
Listen, we got to go, now.

748
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,762
Deep and Noir know that I'm the leak.

749
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,823
- Wait, what?
- Homelander's about to find out any second.

750
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,825
Did you say anything about me,
you fucking asshole?

751
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,810
No, of course not. I didn't say anything.

752
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:26,229
- A-Train, what the fuck? What the fuck?
- Ashley.

753
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:30,233
This is our chance. This is our chance.

754
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:32,693
Florence, anywhere,

755
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,278
but let's go.

756
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,709
I can't.

757
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,338
- Suit yourself.
- Wait, wait.

758
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,590
Your chip.

759
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:56,509
Don't forget to cut it out.

760
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:32,420
Hi, sorry, you're Starlight, right?

761
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,755
- Oh, um...
- Can I just get a selfie?

762
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,966
Oh. Uh, okay.

763
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,360
Oh, that's a good one.

764
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,844
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thanks.

765
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,472
So what's it gonna be, M?

766
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:47,476
You gonna help us stop an assassination,
a violent insurrection?

767
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,978
Or you off to have a wank?

768
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,745
Looks like a wank then.

769
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:08,915
Who's Kessler?

770
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:11,542
- Kessler?
- In the Flatiron.

771
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:14,128
You shouted a name, "Kessler,"

772
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:17,798
and something that had to do with Ezekiel.

773
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:19,759
What was that?

774
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,805
- No idea what you're on about there, luv.
- Hmm.

775
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,518
<i>You're really not coming.</i>

776
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:32,980
Those rum punches
are gonna have to wait, babe.

777
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:34,523
Janine needs you.

778
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:38,027
<i>Monique, the one thing
I've wanted more than anything,</i>

779
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,154
<i>my one prayer every night,</i>

780
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,573
has been to be with you and Janine again.

781
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,659
To be a family.

782
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,244
<i>But if I'm gonna protect you two
the way I have to,</i>

783
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:48,871
<i>I can't.</i>

784
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:50,873
I just...

785
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:54,794
I can't.

786
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,630
Maybe one day.

787
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:00,549
"Maybe"? What the hell's that supposed
to mean, Marvin? Maybe?

788
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:03,177
- I got to go, babe.
<i>- Marvin, wait...</i>

789
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,940
Homelander?

790
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:21,612
Homelander?

791
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:23,322
Are you all right?

792
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:24,532
A-Train?

793
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,826
- I'm so...
- How could he do this to me?

794
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,577
I'm so sorry.

795
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,998
You know, some folks are just...

796
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,001
...well, they're born uppity.

797
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,545
Where is he?

798
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,505
He cut out his tracking chip.

799
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:42,425
And his family's gone, too.

800
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,885
Of course.

801
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:48,472
You sent Deep and Noir
after Butcher?

802
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,808
We talked about this.

803
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,435
Smartest person in the world,

804
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:55,021
and you didn't know A-Train was the leak?

805
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:57,189
I knew.

806
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,486
You knew.

807
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,864
And you let us kill Webweaver for nothing?

808
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,490
Oh, shit.

809
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,576
You killed Webweaver?

810
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,788
Did you think he was the leak?

811
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:16,125
He was a junkie who'd confess
to nailing Christ on the cross

812
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,294
if it got him home for his next fix.

813
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:21,255
I was very clear.

814
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,549
No more secrets.

815
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,134
But A-Train only leaked

816
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,887
exactly the information
I wanted Butcher and his team to know.

817
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,514
He was the perfect
misinformation delivery system.

818
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:31,766
Until now.

819
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,351
This was all part of the plan.

820
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:36,604
Mm-hmm.

821
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,314
Okay.

822
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,483
Get the fuck out of here. You're done.

823
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,943
Go back to your little
litter box in Detroit

824
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,820
and die alone.

825
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,739
You promised.

826
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,574
You promised me you would listen to me.

827
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:51,368
You're lucky I'm not sending you home
in a bucket.

828
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,581
Go.

829
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:58,167
Fine, surround yourself
with people like her.

830
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,128
Then you can systematically eliminate

831
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:02,463
anyone who gets in your way,

832
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,216
but there's one person
you will never, ever defeat.

833
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:09,095
Good luck without me.

834
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,272
We don't need her.

835
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,400
Just-just get out.

836
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:25,778
Are you sure there's...

837
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,324
...nothing I can...

838
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,201
do for you?

839
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,704
No.

840
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:38,207
- Oh, just get the fuck out.
- Okay. Mm-hmm.

841
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:46,048
Bro?

842
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:49,677
Bro!

843
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,887
Bro?

844
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:53,973
Bro.

845
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,518
Bro.

846
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,188
Bro.

847
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:03,941
Hey, you.

848
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,985
Hey, so we've had a day.

849
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:08,279
Wait, what's the rush?

850
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,822
Homelander. He fired me.

851
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:12,867
Wait, but you can't leave. I love you.

852
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:18,414
- We have something special, don't we?
- Wait.

853
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,916
Is she lobotomizing herself
to fuck you, too?

854
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,835
What do you mean, "lobotomizing herself"?

855
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,049
Bro.

856
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:33,929
You were right. It's ready.

857
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:35,681
The glycerol gradient.

858
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:36,891
Uh, it worked.

859
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,268
Even in a shitty lab.

860
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:46,317
After we do an FFA test,

861
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,320
see that the virus is working,

862
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,198
we have some good news for you, <i>mon ami.</i>

863
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:56,619
No!

864
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,745
Kimiko.

865
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,079
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

866
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,674
Okay.

867
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,551
It's okay.

868
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,356
Oh. Oh.

869
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:26,899
Okay.

870
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,317
<i>Mon coeur,</i> look at me.

871
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,902
Take this. Focus on this.

872
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:35,783
I'm sorry!

873
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,727
It's okay.

874
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:05,896
You're okay.

875
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,564
Yeah. You're okay.

876
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,032
You didn't twig to what Sameer was up to?

877
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:19,868
Well, with bindings so thick,
he must have worked them for days.

878
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:21,763
- Maybe weeks. No?
- All right. All right.

879
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:26,917
What matters is if Sameer can get the bug
out of a sheep's head,

880
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:29,128
Frenchie can get it out of Kimiko's gam.

881
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,091
All right, so,
we know the virus works,

882
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,108
- but is it strong enough?
- To kill Homelander?

883
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:36,051
No. But to kill Neuman at least?

884
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,471
<i>C'est possible.</i>

885
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:44,018
We've been on this for weeks,
and all we have is a maybe?

886
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:47,688
Yo...

887
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,483
Why all the grim faces?

888
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:54,069
We've done more with less.

889
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:57,406
Ain't nobody gonna murk the president,
not on our fuckin' watch.

890
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,492
Frenchie, that virus...

891
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:02,202
it ain't gonna cook itself, brother.

892
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:05,039
All right, let's go.

893
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,665
Chop, chop, motherfuckers.

894
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:12,963
<i>Ryan, it's Dad.</i>

895
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:15,632
<i>Hey, listen, buddy, I-I'm sorry
I've been so busy lately,</i>

896
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:19,887
<i>but I hear you're having some issues
with the-the puppet show thing.</i>

897
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,349
<i>Um, look, I got a lot going on here,
buddy, so, uh, do me a favor.</i>

898
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:25,684
<i>Just-just suck it up and-and do it.</i>

899
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:27,936
<i>All right? For me. Terrific.
Love you. Great. Bye.</i>

900
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:18,529
There he is.

901
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,823
Where the fuck were you
when I needed you?

902
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:24,743
Silent treatment goes both ways.

903
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,502
Stop. Stop. Just stop.

904
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,679
<i>This song isn't cool.</i>

905
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:46,056
Honestly, none of this is cool.

906
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,391
Go to fucking commercial!

907
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,560
<i>No. Don't go to commercial.</i>

908
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:52,271
Keep rolling, please.

909
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,320
Let's just go.

910
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,245
<i>Your family isn't your enemy.</i>

911
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:12,708
<i>Your family is all you've got.</i>

912
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,377
<i>I've been thinking
about my mom a lot lately.</i>

913
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:17,421
<i>She died.</i>

914
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:21,425
<i>But she loved Christmas.</i>

915
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,512
<i>And s'mores with Reese's.</i>

916
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:30,225
<i>And</i> Terms of Endearment.

917
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,896
<i>And she loved her husband Billy.</i>

918
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,981
<i>But she wouldn't love this.</i>

919
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:39,776
<i>She wouldn't want me doing it.</i>

920
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,238
<i>My mom always told me to tell the truth...</i>

921
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,200
<i>...which is why...</i>

922
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,041
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

923
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:59,004
And that...

924
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,549
...is why I got faith in the kid,

925
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:05,093
you little fucking beauty.

926
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:11,391
Wanker.

927
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:15,229
<i>I'll always protect you.</i>

928
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:30,327
Call 911!

929
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,925
Hey, Annie?

930
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,760
Mm-hmm.

931
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:51,056
I, uh... I didn't
actually go to urgent care today.

932
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,558
Yeah, I could tell.

933
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:55,936
Yeah. Well, I... I went to go see Vicky.

934
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,981
- Hughie!
- Yeah, look, I know it...

935
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:01,692
I'm okay. It's just...

936
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,987
I don't know. I thought maybe
I could talk her out of it, or...

937
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,530
And...?

938
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:12,703
Whoa. Uh...

939
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,246
what made you...

940
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:18,417
I-I... just thought I would... try it on.

941
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:22,212
Okay. How-How's it... feel?

942
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:26,967
Feels annoying...

943
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,553
that you were right.

944
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:32,139
We'll take it... step by step,

945
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:35,267
one dumpster fire at a time.

946
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:40,147
So, you're saying, I give genius advice.

947
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,357
Don't push it.

948
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:47,154
Now...

949
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,281
admit it.

950
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,533
You have fantasized

951
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:54,995
about... keeping this suit on for this.

952
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,663
I haven't...

953
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:58,582
...not fantasized about it.

954
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:01,168
Mmm.

955
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:14,931
Oh, shit.
