All right, prepare to die,
Klamulon scum.

00:00:08,384 --> 00:00:11,262
The <i>USS Engager</i> is about
to crash the mode on your asses.

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,679
- [laser whooshes in game]
- How do I turn this on?

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,140
[powers on]

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,394
Oh, cool. Okay.
All right. Here we go.

00:00:18,603 --> 00:00:19,646
[chimes]

7
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:22,398
Oh, come on. Why do I have to be
the Squid Clam Warriors?

8
00:00:22,482 --> 00:00:24,567
'Cause you're the enemy
and I'm the hero. Okay?

9
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:25,711
- [scoffs]
- That's how this works.

10
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:26,651
Now, raise your shields,

11
00:00:26,653 --> 00:00:28,589
because I'm ranked top ten
on the global leaderboards

12
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:30,213

00:00:32,242 --> 00:00:35,328
[exclaims] Hey, that's my ship.
That's my global ranking.

15
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:39,666
No, no, no, no. Go somewhere.

16
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:41,876
- You hate this game.
- Not anymore.

17

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,381
Oh, crap. Uh...

[yawns]

20
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:52,262
<i>- Hi, Bart.</i>
- Oh, Mom. It's crazy you called.

21
00:00:52,345 --> 00:00:54,597
I was pulling an all-nighter
studying for this midterm.

22
00:00:54,681 --> 00:00:56,808
<i>- Yeah. No, you weren't.</i>
- Yeah. No, I wasn't.

23
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:58,977
Never try to fool someone
who's won two Pulitzers.

<i>that I would like you
to write a follow-up piece.</i>

27
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:07,777
Yeah, sure. When's the deadline?

28
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,321
<i>Uh, if you could get something
to me by...</i>

29
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,950
Mom? Mom?

30
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:16,035
Yeah, that looked like
more than just bad service.

31
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:23,960
Bart? Nora, is that really you?

32
00:01:24,544 --> 00:01:25,712
Uh, sis...

33
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:29,424
is it just me
or does Mom look really young?

34
00:01:32,552 --> 00:01:34,053
Oh, shrap.

35
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:56,831
[Nora]
Mom, what's the last thing you remember?

36
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:01,748
I was in my office with Taylor,
then I got lost in the time stream.

37
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:04,500
Guys, I need to talk to your dad
about what happened.

38
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:08,713
- Uh, Dad's off-world with Uncle Jay.
- But past-Dad is still looking for Mom.

39
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:12,967
I know he's gonna figure this out.
We should really get you back to 2022.

40
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:22,225
[Iris West grunts]

41
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:26,648
What was that?
Why can't you run back in time?

42
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:28,232
I've seen those particles before.

43
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,878
Mom, I think the Still Force
is keeping you here.

44
00:02:30,902 --> 00:02:31,902
Why would Deon do that?

45
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:33,487
[groans in pain]

46
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:34,614
Mom.

47
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,034
- No, it's gone. I'm okay.
- No, you're not.

48
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:39,303
Sis, what are we supposed to do?

49
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:40,971
We don't even know what
this time sickness stuff is,

50
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:41,911
let alone how to cure it.

51
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:44,957
Or how Mom got infected
in the first place.

52
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:56,010
- [The Flash] I know this is a big step.
- Yeah, I'll say.

53
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:59,305
Now, that... That's a superhero.

54
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:03,685
Are you sure I, like, need to wear this?

55
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:05,144
Maybe we're moving too fast.

56
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:09,649
These suits monitor our vitals and
allow us to communicate with each other.

57
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:14,487
That keeps us safe,
just in case something happens.

58
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,739
Like my connection
to the Negative Speed Force.

59
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,990
I know you can handle this,

60
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:20,076
and I will be there with you
every step of the way.

61
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:26,416
- You okay?
- Yeah. [chuckles softly]

62
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,877
Yeah. Let's get back to training.

63
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:42,223
[Eobard] You're at Mach 1.7.

64
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,268
1.78.

65
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:47,353
Wow, that's double
her last recorded speed.

66
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:48,813
[rapid digital beeping]

67

Meena, your heart rate's in the red.
You need to slow down.

68
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:55,027
- [panting] No. I can get to Mach Two.
- You're pushing yourself too hard.

69
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:57,029
[panting] I told you, I got this.

70
00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:58,573
[panting]

71
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:00,867
[grunts]

72
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:10,209
- You okay?
- [breathing heavily] Yeah, I'm fine.

73
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:13,727
- I just got the wind knocked out of me.
- What were you thinking?

74
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,798
Speed-healing
doesn't make you invincible.

75
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:17,425
Don't you think I know that?

76
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:29,895
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:34,233
And you're right, okay?

78
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:36,902
[sighs]

79
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:38,738
I'm a disaster. [sniffles]

80
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,366
[sighs]

81
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:46,661
I'll talk to her.

82
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,591
Get it together, Meena. Get it together.

83
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:02,845
[groans] Oh, God. You got this.
Pull it together. [sighs] Okay.

84
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:06,974
I'm done. I'm done. I'm done.

85
00:05:19,946 --> 00:05:25,243
[sighs] I'm sorry, Flash. I appreciate
everything you've done for me...

86
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,121
but I'm not ready for this.

87
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,917
Meena, why are you
pushing yourself so hard?

88
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:39,799
You can lap the planet in seconds.
I can barely stay on a treadmill.

89
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:42,945
Flash, how am I supposed to be a hero?

90
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,889
- You already are.
- No, I'm not.

91
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,476
Flash, I don't have what it takes.

92
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:52,728
- I think you do.
- Why?

93
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,625
Because, honestly, when I first
built that machine, I wanted...

94
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:01,070
I wanted...

95
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:04,698
nothing.

96
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:08,076
Look.

97
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,664
I'll never be the person you are.

98
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,213
Holy crap.

99
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:24,260
- You're...
- Officer Barry Allen, CSI.

100
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,931
So the fastest man alive
is a badge with a day job?

101
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:32,935
- That's so...
- Ordinary.

102
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:35,479
Yeah, that's my point.

103
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:39,609
You'd be surprised
at people's capacity to rise up

104
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:41,861
and help others during a crisis.

105
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:44,822
They just need
to be given the opportunity.

106
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:49,410
That suit, that's your opportunity.

107
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:53,282
I think you're gonna
be surprised at how well it fits.

108
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,642
But you have to give yourself a chance.

109
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:01,671
[sighs]

110
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:07,261
- Damn, that's good.
- [chuckles] I have my moments.

111
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:13,309
Fine. I'll give it a shot.

112
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,022
Besides, I already have my own suit.

113
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,650
Guess all I need is
my own superhero name.

114
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:22,807
No, you already have that, too.

115
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:25,946
Fast Track.

116
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:32,370
Fast Track.

117
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,499
[breathes deeply]

118
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:45,967
[Dr. Wells]
So you're here to fulfill my destiny.

119
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:51,055
Well... you can start
by getting me out of this prison.

120
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:53,223
And then...

121
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,520
giving me my speed back.

122
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,565
Oh, you'll get everything
that you deserve, Thawne.

123
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,069
Is that right?

124
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:10,783
And just what is that going to cost me?

125
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:13,493
Just one thing.

126
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:20,376
- Your life.
- No. Wait. No!

127
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,088
[screaming]

128
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:44,108
[rapid digital beeping]

129
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:47,485
What is it?

130
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,423
[Chester] There was just a major
energy surge in Lian Yu.

131
00:08:49,447 --> 00:08:51,741
- What kind of energy?
- The temporal isotopic kind.

132
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:52,782
Deon.

133
00:08:52,784 --> 00:08:54,428
Let us know what you find
when you get there.

134
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:56,120
After last time, I reached out to Cisco.

135
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:58,906
S.T.A.R. Labs now has
a secure comm link to the island.

136
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:12,318
[Allegra over comms]
<i>Find anything, boss?</i>

137
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,847
[The Flash over comms]
<i>It's Thawne. He's dead.</i>

138
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:20,686
It's like his body was aged
a hundred years in an instant.

139
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:23,773
Which the Still Force could easily do.

140
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:27,902
Why would Deon kill Thawne now?
Doesn't make any sense.

141
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,738
Deon hasn't been himself
since we went to search for Iris.

142
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:34,784
Sorry, Barr. Gotta bounce.

143
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:39,205
It's exactly what I was afraid of.
Her time sickness has infected his mind.

144
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:41,999
Chester, can our isotopic sensor
find him?

145
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:46,212
No. It worked last time because Deon
exited the Still Force for a moment.

146
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,757
But now that he's disappeared,
we're flying blind.

147
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,927
With the power to travel across
the past, present and future...

148
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,846
he could turn up at any moment.

149
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,439
So you were out patrolling last night?
You told me you were working late.

150
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:07,566
I was. Kinda.

151
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:10,903
Look, babe,
you don't have to worry about me.

152
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:15,199
Guess what. I don't just throw emotions
in and out of people now.

153
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,535
I can induce vertigo, too.

154
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,162
- You mean like Rosa Dillon?
- Yeah.

155
00:10:20,246 --> 00:10:21,204
Babe, that's not a good thing.

156
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:23,415
It's not like
I'm some kind of super villain.

157
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:25,459
Joe, I would think
that you would be happy for me.

158
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:28,629
I am. But I just wish
I knew how all this happened.

159
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,717
Oh, speak of the devil.
We are about to have a visitor.

160
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:37,805
Wait for it.

161
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:38,848
[knock on door]

162
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,684
- Come on in, Rosa.
- Hold up, hold up.

163
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,061
Ain't nobody invite
your criminal behind in here.

164
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:47,648
Really? 'Cause I think she did
when she stole all my powers.

165
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,649
Uh...

166
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,986
Wait. [hesitating] You what?
Cecile, is that why you leveled up?

167
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:55,030
Okay, time out. I think...
I think that I can explain...

168
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:58,075
You think? I want my powers back.

169
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,411
- Why do you think I was tailing you?
- Oh, you what?

170
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,246
I was tailing her.

171
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:06,375
Right after all my powers went missing,
I got a mental image of her in my mind.

172
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,043
So, yeah, I thought I'd swing by

173
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:09,646
to see if I could get to
the bottom of all this.

174
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:13,257
Now, that makes sense. But how did
Cecile end up with your meta-powers?

175
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,758
I, uh... Hear me out.

176
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:17,682
You know how I can throw emotions
into somebody else? I can take them...

177
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,014
- Yeah, I taught you that.
- Right.

178
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:24,768
It seems like now somehow I can actually

179
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:28,939
tap into the powers
of any psychic that's nearby.

180
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:31,150
Okay, you live off of Third Street,
right?

181
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:34,320
- Yes.
- Yes. Last night I was out patrolling.

182
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:37,907
There was somebody who needed protection
from a mugger, and I thought to myself,

183
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:42,745
"I wonder if I could use
Rosa's vertigo powers,"

184
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:46,540
and I tried it, and I did it,
and it worked.

185
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:50,169
That can't be a coincidence.

186
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:55,424
Congratulations. You cracked the case.

187
00:11:57,218 --> 00:12:00,218
But I still don't have my powers back.
You got an explanation for that, too?

188
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,391
- No, she doesn't.
- No, I don't.

189
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:07,228
- Then what am I supposed to do?
- I don't know.

190
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:11,148
What? My theory is just that.
It's a theory.

191
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,399
Then you need to test it.

192
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,069
[dialing]

193
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:22,117
Hey, David. Sorry to bother you, man.
I need a favor from the chief of police.

194
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:27,373
I need two visitor passes
to the meta-wing in Iron Heights ASAP.

195
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:29,249
Thank you so much.

196
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,125
[hangs up]

197
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:38,884
So that's what's causing my life
to be a nightmare.

198
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,678
I'm afraid so.

199
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:45,683
It's a negative tachyon,
and your body is flooded with them.

200
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:48,117
They're the cause of your time sickness.

201
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,646
- So how'd they get there?
- I don't know.

202
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:55,526
But the negative tachyons inside you
are increasing exponentially.

203
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:58,946
And that's putting an incredible strain
on your physiology.

204
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,032
Your body can't withstand this forever.

205
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:03,116
[groans]

206
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,288
- Mom.
- It's okay.

207
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,331
[groans, pants]

208
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:16,505
I saw the Forces. Bashir, Deon, Alexa.

209
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,341
But something happened.
They were different.

210
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,199
Why would I see something like that?

211
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:26,724
All I can theorize is that
somehow your sickness

212
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:30,102
must also be triggering
some kind of temporal visions.

213
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:35,308
- It's the only way.
- Agreed.

214
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:37,460
But someone needs to stay here
to keep Mom safe.

215
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,962
You were with Dad in the Speed Force.
I'll stay here.

216
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,612
I'll go to 2022 and get help.

217
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:42,573
- Are you sure that's a good idea?
- No.

218
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:47,619
But if anybody can help save Mom...
it's Dad.

219
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,125
[treadmill running]

220
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,311
- [treadmill stops]
- [Meena panting]

221
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:55,935
[Eobard] You're gonna burn yourself out.

222
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,425
You've been training
all morning with the Flash,

223
00:13:58,464 --> 00:14:02,176
and now, instead of resting,
you're pushing yourself even harder.

224
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:07,097
- Eobard, you're worrying too much.
- Meena, you need to ease up.

225
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:08,432
[panting]

226
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,101
Not yet. I need to keep training.

227
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:14,480
Why? So you can kill yourself?
What's gotten into you?

228
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:20,235
Eobard, what's the point
of having these powers...

229
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:21,612
[rumbling]

230
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,622
We've been looking for you, Eobard.

231
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:34,165
Who are you people?

232
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,462
Who we are isn't important.
At least not to a dead man.

233
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,297
Whoever or whatever you are,

234
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,150
you need to get the hell out
of my building.

235
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:43,174
Oh.

236
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:48,347
Before I make you.

237
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,100
Oh, I like her.

238
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:54,603
Well, don't get too attached.
Play time's almost over.

239
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:58,482
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You'll find out soon enough.

240
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:01,902
- I'm not kidding. Back off.
- [Alexa] Or what?

241
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:02,986
[scoffs]

242
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,739
You have no idea
who you're up against, do you?

243
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:10,452
- Then enlighten me.
- We're the true Forces of the universe.

244
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:15,791
Ones written in darkness.
And we're here to kill you, Thawne.

245
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,710
So you can fulfill your purpose.

246
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,466
Don't look so negative.

247
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,429
I promise I'll make it fast.

248
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,439
- I won't let you hurt him.
- I was hoping you'd say that.

249
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:39,898
I can taste her fear.

250
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,027
- [smacks lips] Ooh, amuse-bouche.
- Hold on.

251
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:48,239
Too easy.

252
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,702
Looks like you're the last Thawne left.

253
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:58,709
[chuckles] Hope you enjoyed
your time, man. 'Cause you're all out.

254
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,084
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

255
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,797
- What is it?
- He's coming.

256
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,599
Not fast enough, Flash.
Besides, this ain't your kind of party.

257
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:17,352
I'm gonna crush you...
[distorted]...like a grape.

258
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:20,723
[in normal voice] What the...

259
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,743
[both panting]

260
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:33,744
Who are they?

261
00:16:33,745 --> 00:16:35,287
- [panting]
- Whoa, whoa.

262
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,832
It's my speed. Something's wrong.

263
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,227
Well, it probably had something to do
with that light show you just put on.

264
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:44,505
[panting] No, it's like when Meena
attacked me at the dam.

265
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:48,008
- Only much stronger.
- They tried to kill Eobard.

266
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:52,429
- Just like at Lian Yu.
- And that's just the beginning.

267
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,099
You see, there's only room for
one set of Forces in the universe.

268
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:57,893
The negative ones.

269
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,811
And we're tired of sharing our turf.

270
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:02,499
Speed Force Nora and the others,
what did you do to them?

271
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:05,192
Oh, he just gave them
a case of the Mondays.

272
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:07,861
It'll be a while
before you see them again.

273
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:10,614
Why are you doing this,
and what does it have to do with me?

274
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:11,823
You're not the Avatar.

275
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,118
You just being here makes us weak.

276
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,871
So sacrifices got to be made, Flash.

277
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:21,041
And you've got to pay for what you did.

278
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,425
I don't care who they are.
I won't let them hurt Eobard.

279
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:31,592
- [continues panting]
- Whoa, whoa.

280
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:32,719
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey.

281
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:35,055
All right, we need to get him some help.
Come on.

282
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,651
[Chester over comms]
<i>I think itjust arrived.</i>

283
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,310
Uh, Chester?

284
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:43,564
Oh, yeah, yeah.
So sorry about the hacking comms thing,

285
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:46,066
<i>but once I saw the Flash's vitals,
I had to track him down.</i>

286
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,402
Do you think you can bring
the Flash to S.T.A.R. Labs?

287
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:51,446
Yeah. Be there in under a minute.

288
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:55,200
- Good. 'Cause he's got company.
- The best kind.

289
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:02,833
[Mark] Caitlin, why are you helping me?
I thought you gave up on Frost.

290
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I had.

291
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,087
But after I saw your designs,

292
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:10,090
I realized I'll never stop
trying to bring her back.

293
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:12,425
I can't.

294
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:24,396
Okay, if all goes according to plan,

295
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:26,690
the pod's cerebral circuitry
should stimulate

296
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:30,235
and then reactivate Frost's residual
subconscious left inside your mind.

297
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:33,822
- And then I'll get her voice back.
- Yeah. Then when she's with us again...

298
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,950
We can pick up where we left off
and build her a new body.

299
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:42,831
Hey, what if Barry
discovers what we're doing?

300
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,459
You know, he pulls you out,
destroys the CRC?

301
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:47,669
Then we'll find another way.

302
00:18:58,555 --> 00:18:59,555
[Mark sighs]

303
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:18,075
[whooshing]

304
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:29,294
[Nora] It was like slamming into
a brick wall.

305
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,506
It didn't matter how fast I was.

306
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:36,426
The negative tachyons in Mom's body
won't let her travel through time.

307
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:40,555
I still can't believe we have to fight
Negative Forces or that they even exist.

308
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:43,892
True that. And what did they mean
by Thawne's not the Avatar?

309
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:46,103
[breaths deeply]

310
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:52,025
Dad, you said that it was just
Negative Deon, Alexa and Bashir.

311
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:56,279
But there was no Negative Speed Force
Nora. Where was she?

312
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:00,826
[sighs] This other Deon
said I had to pay for what I did.

313
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,911
And I took away Thawne's speed

314
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:05,205
by severing his connection
to the Negative Speed Force.

315
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:06,915
Which might have erased Negative Nora.

316
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,001
That must be why they're weaker now
and why they blame you.

317
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:12,879
Maybe they think that killing Thawne

318
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,590
will somehow bring back
the Negative Speed Force Avatar.

319
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:16,632
Hold on.

320
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:21,389
If they're tired of sharing their turf,
they'd wanna level the playing field.

321
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:23,432
By weakening the forces we know.

322
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,771
Iris' time sickness.

323
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:34,943
It was never about her.
They knew Deon would try to help.

324
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,529
And Mom's sickness
would spread to the Positive Forces.

325
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,072
Taking them out of the picture.

326
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,323
[Chester] Wait. Hold on.

327
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:44,327
What happens if the bad Forces
end up being the only ones left?

328
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:47,497
Then every speedster we know
could cease to exist.

329
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:51,668
Leaving the entire planet unprotected
from the Negative Forces.

330
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,714
Nora, you need to run back to 2049.

331
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:59,384
You and Bart have to watch over Iris
while we face the Forces here.

332
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:02,804
But you're still too weak
to fight again. Dad, if they come back...

333
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:05,265
They will.
But nobody's gonna die tonight.

334
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:08,477
We're gonna find a way to save
your mom and end this. I promise.

335
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,526
[sighs] Barr, these Forces?

336
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,696
They're literally gods,
and there's three of them.

337
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:21,765
How are we supposed to fight that?

338
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:36,046
It's all three isotopic energy masses.
Electrochemical, temporal

339
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:37,297
and geothermic.

340
00:21:37,298 --> 00:21:39,674
They're gathering strength
on their own planes of existence.

341
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:40,998
That's what's bleeding through.

342
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:51,311
Look, guys, I know this feels different.
That's because it is.

343
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:55,857
This is personal to them, which means
it's not gonna be an ordinary fight.

344
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,442
We need to be ready for anything.

345
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:00,904
Have you heard back from Cecile yet?

346
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:04,199
Yeah. Joe said she was at Iron Heights
and that it's important.

347
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,952
She thinks she might know
how her powers are leveling up.

348
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:09,079
- But she'll be here as soon as she can.
- Good.

349
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:11,474
'Cause we're going to need
all the meta-power we can get.

350
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:13,834
[beeps rapidly]

351
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:19,047
Mona, I don't have much time,
so here's how it's gonna go.

352
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:21,466
I'm gonna take those off,
you're gonna read my mind.

353
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,590
Tell me what I'm thinking.

354
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:24,970
- If you can.
- With pleasure.

355
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:27,806
Don't get any ideas, Mona.

356
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:31,434
She's taking the cuffs off,
but this is a meta interrogation cell.

357
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:32,811
The walls are meta-dampened,

358
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:35,146
so you won't be able
to read anything except us.

359
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,858
Like I wanna read
that empty mind of yours.

360
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:40,277
- Watch it.
- Or what?

361
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:42,296
You're gonna put me back in prison?

362
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,199
Can we save it for the playground,
ladies? And, Mona, no tricks.

363
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:50,495
Now, let's have some fun.

364
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:03,008
[inhales sharply] Oh!

365
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:08,179
What'd you do to me?
My telepathy is gone.

366
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:10,431
Oh!

367
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:14,436
Excuse me.
Somebody has a potty mouth.

368
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:18,231
And no, Rosa, you are not
the good cop in this situation.

369
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:19,900
'Cause you stole her powers, too.

370
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:25,780
[gasps]

371
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:28,116
What is it?

372
00:23:28,117 --> 00:23:30,493
[indistinct whispering]

373
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:31,661
I can hear them.

374
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:37,125
All of them. Everyone. I can hear
the entire city, all of their thoughts.

375
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,730
[Barry] <i>This is personal to them,
which means it's not gonna be</i>

376
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:40,752
<i>an ordinary fight.</i>

377
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:41,754
Barry.

378
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:43,399
[Barry] <i>We need to be ready
for anything.</i>

379
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:47,010
- Barry. We have to go.
- What the hell, Horton?

380
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,804
No. No way. She said
these walls were meta-dampened.

381
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:52,432
How can you read
every single mind in town all at once?

382
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:53,473
Even I couldn't do that.

383
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,155
I don't know.
I don't understand it either.

384
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:56,977
I think I do.

385
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:01,024
Look, I don't know how,

386
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:06,363
but, Horton, you're becoming
one of the most powerful metas

387
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:07,864
this city has ever seen.

388
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:11,952
- The planet, for that matter.
- [softly] What?

389
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,596
[in normal voice]
What's happening to me?

390
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:27,884
You're telling me this is just some
sick play by the Negative Forces?

391
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:30,635
Damn.

392
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:35,433
The negative tachyons replicating
inside Iris' body keep increasing.

393
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,579
I don't know if she'll survive
another temporal attack.

394
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:41,022
- There's got to be something we can do.
- There is.

395
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:44,567
Pray that Barry can find the strength
to defeat the Negative Forces.

396
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:49,864
Because it's the only way
to cure Iris and save her life.

397
00:24:58,873 --> 00:24:59,831
[Eobard] Hang on.

398
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:00,935
[Meena] There's no time
to stop and talk.

399
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,639
I need to keep training
for our next fight.

400
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:03,794
Hey.

401
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:07,215
I know you.

402
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:10,885
And that adorable
brow furrow thing you're doing,

403
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:13,263
that only happens
when something's really bothering you.

404
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,890
So you want to tell me what's wrong now?

405
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:18,601
I mean, aside from cosmic forces
trying to kill me.

406
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:24,024
Because you have been pushing yourself
beyond your limits all day,

407
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:25,984
and you still haven't told me why.

408
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:29,904
And with the way things are now,
I get it. Look, I'm scared too. Okay?

409
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,742
But whatever happens,
let's face it together.

410
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:43,585
I told Barry this morning
that I could never be a hero like him.

411
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,464
[scoffs] I don't have what it takes.

412
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:50,550
So he convinced you otherwise,
and that's why you're training so hard.

413
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,677
- You're afraid of letting him down.
- No.

414
00:25:54,846 --> 00:25:56,556
I'm afraid of letting you down.

415
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:02,812
Eobard, this... this was always
supposed to be you.

416
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:07,358
And it should be. This is your dream.

417
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:10,361
- You're keeping it alive.
- [sighs] That's what makes it worse.

418
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:15,617
I never wanted to be a speedster.
I... I still don't.

419
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:21,539
Eobard, I wanted to share
meta-powers with the world

420
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:26,711
so people could heal their bodies
and live fuller lives.

421
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:30,089
That was my dream.

422
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:33,718
Now I'm afraid of losing it.

423
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:36,554
You're not.

424
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:40,016
Because what you're doing now,

425
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:44,229
risking your life
to fight side by side with the Flash

426
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:47,398
to make me safer,
to make the city safer...

427
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:52,153
Meena, it's the same dream.

428
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:55,800
And you may not be able
to share your speed,

429
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:58,034
but you're doing something far greater.

430
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:01,371
You're sharing yourself with all of us.

431
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:06,126
And I couldn't be prouder.

432
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:10,380
[sighs, chuckles softly]

433
00:27:14,926 --> 00:27:17,345
[exhales, chuckles softly]

434
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,141
How did I get so lucky?

435
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:24,519
Blame it on a resume.

436
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:35,488
[exhales] God, I wish the B.L.O.C.
wasn't only programmed to just me.

437
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:40,034
If only there was a way for me
to share this gift with you.

438
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,538
[sighs wearily]

439
00:27:43,955 --> 00:27:44,955
[The Flash] You can.

440
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:50,753
I'm sorry. I just came down
to check on your training.

441
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:51,838
I didn't mean to intrude.

442
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:57,385
Meena, I've been trying all day to find
a way to give us a fighting chance

443
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:59,470
against the threats
we're facing with no luck,

444
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:02,765
but... you just found the answer.

445
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:06,186
Which is?

446
00:28:07,896 --> 00:28:10,064
I'm gonna teach Meena
how to share her powers.

447
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:12,859
And turn you into a speedster.

448
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:29,125
[thunder rumbling]

449
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,338
[high-pitched buzzing]

450
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:01,866
Okay, people,
according to S.T.A.R. Labs satellites,

451
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,452
those isotopic energies,
they're on the move.

452
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:06,663
Let me guess.
They're headed straight for us?

453
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:09,165
The Negative Forces want a fight,
let's give it to them.

454
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:10,833
You guys know the plan.

455
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:13,378
Just keep them occupied
long enough for us to do this.

456
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:19,175
Okay. Now what?

457
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:24,514
Take Eobard's hand,
listen to my voice and concentrate.

458
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:27,892
All right. Let's do this thing.

459
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:30,436
You're gonna need this first.

460
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:52,834
Flash, what happened to me
at Keystone Dam,

461
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:54,585
what if it happens to Eobard?

462
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:58,381
It won't. For the same reason
you were able to become yourself again.

463
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:02,260
The love you have for each other
balances you both.

464
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:07,348
[whooshing]

465
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:18,693
What is this, the B-team?
You got to be kidding me.

466
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:23,072
- Clearly y'all have a death wish.
- I'm a little disappointed.

467
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:24,532
Get used to that feeling.

468
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:30,621
[distorted screaming]

469
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:33,416
[rumbling]

470
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:38,546
[Meena breathes deeply]

471
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:49,222
Nothing's happening.

472
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:51,642
Transferring speed
isn't just about energy,

473
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:52,977
it's about how you feel.

474
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:56,105
You're sharing more than your powers.
You're sharing yourself.

475
00:30:56,981 --> 00:30:59,067
Imagine giving
the most important part of yourself

476
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,443
to another by letting them in.

477
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:02,862
[breathing deeply]

478
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:11,162
[chuckles]

479
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:18,586
No way. You're not this strong.

480
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:21,005
Allegra, now.

481
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:22,089
[grunts]

482
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:26,010
Okay, that's really bad.

483
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:30,807
[Bashir chuckles]
<i>Ooh, Allegra, time to play.</i>

484
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:33,643
[in normal voice] I'll make this fast.

485
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:35,978
[grunts]

486
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:44,487
[breathing heavily]

487
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,570
Do your worst, lady.

488
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:49,617
That's an inverse energy trap.
Good luck fighting yourself.

489
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:57,124
[Eobard breathes deeply]

490
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:01,712
I feel alive.

491
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:06,843
But there's so much hate.

492
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:10,430
[groans softly] It burns.

493
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:12,431
[Eobard groans softly]

494
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:14,910
The Negative Speed Force
is trying to influence you.

495
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:18,187
You have to fight it. You have to
help each other find a balance.

496
00:32:23,234 --> 00:32:26,529
[Bashir, in sing-song] <i>I'm over here.</i>

497
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:29,282
[chuckling]

498
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:32,075
[in normal voice] Boo.

499
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:35,704
So close.

500
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:41,376
Psst.

501
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,130
[chuckles]

502
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:45,882
<i>Ooh!</i>

503
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:47,049
You're bad at this.

504
00:32:47,592 --> 00:32:49,427
[chuckling]

505
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:55,850
Poor orphan Allegra.

506
00:32:56,392 --> 00:33:00,771
The power of light in your hands
but born into a life of darkness.

507
00:33:00,855 --> 00:33:03,357
What is that,
some kind of evil poetry diss?

508
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:05,586
'Cause you're gonna need
a lot more than that to scare me.

509
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:06,944
[Bashir chuckling]

510
00:33:08,196 --> 00:33:10,198
Why would I scare you...

511
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:13,618
when I can kill you?

512
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:21,709
[straining]
I can't hold him much longer.

513
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:24,253
The field's breaking down.

514
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,880
She's too strong.

515
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:30,551
[Bashir chuckles]

516
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:42,688
[grunts]

517
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:50,321
[panting]

518
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:57,036
Don't give up. Don't give up. We've
gotta buy them as much time as we can.

519
00:33:57,286 --> 00:34:00,414
It's too late. You're all out.

520
00:34:00,498 --> 00:34:01,498
[gasps]

521
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:08,422
Meena, remember what I told you.
This is your chance.

522
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:12,885
Your moment. You can do this.
You can be a hero. And you're not alone.

523
00:34:22,353 --> 00:34:24,272
Looks like y'all gotta bounce.

524
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:26,357
Permanently.

525
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,366
[panting]

526
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:38,077
Back off. All of you.

527
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:40,746
That's your only warning.

528
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:43,331
Seriously?

529
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,669
- That's all you got?
- It's three against one, Flash.

530
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:48,296
[distorted] You don't stand a chance.

531
00:34:50,381 --> 00:34:51,549
Good thing I brought backup.

532
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:14,780
- It's time for some payback.
- You sure we can do this?

533
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:16,324
As long as we work together.

534
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:24,914
[grunts]

535
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,599
- Where'd he go?
- I'm guessing not far.

536
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:53,067
[screams]

537
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:54,087
- Mom.
- [Iris West panting]

538
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:55,988
Mom, you have to stay with us this time.

539
00:35:56,322 --> 00:36:01,118
The Forces he's fighting...
Barry... It's a new moment in time.

540
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,162
- What does she mean?
- It's another vision.

541
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:05,498
I think she's seeing something
from 2022.

542
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:07,917
This can't be happening.
Time is changing.

543
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,795
Whatever's happening in the past
is connected to her time sickness,

544
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:12,439
and now it's literally
changing the future.

545
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:14,548
Which means we have no idea
how this will turn out.

546
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:16,193
- I can't. [groans]
- [Bart] No. No, Mom, stop.

547
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:17,343
Wait. We're not losing you.

548
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:18,426
[groans in pain]

549
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,221
[man] <i>No. Wait. No.</i>

550
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:23,182
Sacrifices got to be made, Flash.

551
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:24,391
What is it?

552
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:26,852
[breath trembling] The visions.

553
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:29,938
They're not random.

554
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:39,782
You can't win, Flash.
We're weak, but so are you.

555
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:43,327
Which means we can handle
anything you dish out.

556
00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:49,378
This might be our only window
to win this fight.

557
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,503
But to do it, I need you two
to hold them here while I get ready.

558
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:03,055
I have to give in.

559
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:04,724
- No, Mom, you can't.
- I have to.

560
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:06,727
It's the only way to see
what's really happening.

561
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:07,809
Iris, wait.

562
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:12,106
You're not the Avatar.
You just being here makes us weak.

563
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:14,525
And you've got to pay for what you did.

564
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,778
What are you doing?
We needed that to find Iris.

565
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:19,363
Sacrifices got to be made.

566
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:22,658
No. The sacrifice isn't Thawne.

567
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:25,535
It never was.

568
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,953
The real sacrifice is...

569
00:38:49,787 --> 00:38:53,207
[panting] Iris? Iris? Iris?

570
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,544
[voice cracking] No, no, no.

571
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:03,551
[Deon] I told you, Flash.

572
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:10,891
We're tired of taking the back seat
to those sorry-ass opposites of yours.

573
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:13,978
Sacrifices had to happen.

574
00:39:17,648 --> 00:39:19,358
And that ain't the only one.

575
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:23,487
[chuckles]

576
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,785
[breath trembling]

577
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:35,040
[crying softly]

578
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,678
[gasps]

579
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:49,679
What?

580
00:39:53,642 --> 00:39:54,977
[groaning]

581
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:59,315
- Eobard? Eobard? Hey.
- Get back.

582
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:03,068
Something's wrong.

583
00:40:03,694 --> 00:40:05,112
[Eobard screaming]

584
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:09,700
What's happening to him?

585
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:12,161
[Eobard continues screaming]

586
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:14,079

[gasps, screams]

589
00:40:32,306 --> 00:40:33,641
Thanks for the resurrection...

590
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:37,186
[distorted] Flash.
