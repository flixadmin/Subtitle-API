1
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,458
We're here to say goodbye
to our brothers and sisters.

2
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,545
To our fathers and mothers.

3
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,509
To our friends.

4
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:32,645
Our fellow men and women
who set aside their differences...

5
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,431
to fight together...

6
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,855
and die together

7
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,775
so that others might live.

8
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,071
Everyone in this world

9
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,495
owes them a debt
that can never be repaid.

10
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,825
It is our duty and our honor

11
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,494
to keep them alive in memory...

12
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,039
for those who come after us

13
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,168
and those who come after them,

14
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,551
for as long as men draw breath.

15
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:13,349
They were the shields
that guarded the realms of men.

16
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,515
And we shall never see
their like again.

17
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,491
Have you seen Arya?

18
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,080
You can still smell
the burning bodies,

19
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,438
and that's where your head is at?

20
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,125
- I just want to thank her for...
- I'm sure you do.

21
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,545
- Look, it's not about that.
- Of course it's about that, you twat.

22
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,716
Why shouldn't it be?

23
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,420
The dead are dead. You're not.

24
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,234
Gendry.

25
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,572
That's right, isn't it?

26
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,201
Yes, Your Grace.

27
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,495
You're Robert Baratheon's son.

28
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,840
You are aware
he took my family's throne

29
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,633
and tried to have me murdered?

30
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,422
I didn't even know he was my father
until after he was dead.

31
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,512
Yes, he's dead.

32
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,552
His brothers are, too.

33
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,852
So who's Lord of Storm's End now?

34
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,896
I don't know, Your Grace.

35
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:31,815
Does anyone?

36
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,623
I think you should be
Lord of Storm's End.

37
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,588
I can't be. I'm a bastard.

38
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:55,668
No, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon
of Storm's End,

39
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,633
the lawful son of Robert Baratheon.

40
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,844
Because that is what I have made you.

41
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:14,525
To Lord Gendry Baratheon
of Storm's End.

42
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,398
To Gendry!

43
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,858
Lord Gendry!

44
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,702
Gendry!

45
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,781
- Gendry!
- Gendry!

46
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,203
Lord Gendry!

47
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,206
Gendry!

48
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,840
That's easy, isn't it?

49
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,758
- A fitting reward for a hero.
- Uh, hold on.

50
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:44,058
And a Lord of Storm's End
who will be forever loyal to you.

51
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,931
- Come, my lord.
- See?

52
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,350
You're not the only one who's clever.

53
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,778
I have to go down
and get another barrel.

54
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,782
We fought dead things
and lived to talk about it.

55
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,994
If this isn't the time to drink,
when is?

56
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:26,301
The last time I saw her, I told her
I'd kill her if I ever saw her again.

57
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,977
- I'm sure you had your reasons.
- I did.

58
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,601
- I do.
- So did you?

59
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:34,816
Never got the chance.

60
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,236
She did it to herself.

61
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,524
Or her god did it to her.

62
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,323
The Lord of Light.

63
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:49,741
We play his game for him,
we fight his war and win,

64
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:50,870
and then

65
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,538
he fucks off.

66
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,835
No signs, no blessings.
Who knows what he wants?

67
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,008
I don't imagine
thinking about that subject

68
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,131
will leave you
any happier than before.

69
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,742
And what if
I'm not trying to be happy?

70
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,720
Then you're in luck.

71
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,937
We may have defeated them,

72
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,274
but we still have us to contend with.

73
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,735
Thank you. I feel much better.

74
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,333
More ale!

75
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,795
This is clever.

76
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,178
Even better than the saddle
I designed for you.

77
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,761
It's the same as the one
Daeron Targaryen built

78
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,764
for his crippled nephew 120 years ago.

79
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,766
I liked that one.

80
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,849
You know our history
better than anyone.

81
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,482
That will be useful
as Lord of Winterfell.

82
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,025
I'm not Lord of Winterfell.

83
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,984
You're the only surviving
trueborn son of Ned Stark.

84
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,080
You don't want it.

85
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,288
I don't really want anymore.

86
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,374
I envy you.

87
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,083
You shouldn't envy me.

88
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,587
Mostly I live in the past.

89
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,727
- All of it.
- Go on.

90
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,726
- No, not in one go.
- Go on. I believe in you.

91
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,335
We have to
celebrate our victory.

92
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,316
Vomiting is not celebrating.

93
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,644
Yes, it is.

94
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,855
Ah!

95
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,439
To the Dragon Queen!

96
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,786
To Arya Stark, the hero of Winterfell!

97
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,701
Drink!

98
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,052
I'm fine!

99
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,778
Your turn.

100
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,447
Um...

101
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:31,364
- You are an only child.
- Oh.

102
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,154
- I told you I was.
- You didn't.

103
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,410
- I did.
- I surmised it.

104
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,458
Mm-hm. Drink.

105
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,331
Go again.

106
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,413
Why does he get to go again?

107
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,419
Because it's my game.

108
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:48,048
You have danced with Renly Baratheon.

109
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,048
- Uh...
- Drink.

110
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,388
The other way around!

111
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,515
I saw him riding that thing.

112
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,393
- We all did.
- No. No.

113
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,817
I saw him riding that thing.

114
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,895
- That's right, you did.
- I did.

115
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,319
That's why we all agreed
to follow him.

116
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,824
That's the kind of man he is.

117
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:14,574
He's little...

118
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,451
...but he's strong.

119
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,667
Strong enough to befriend an enemy

120
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,039
and get murdered for it!

121
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:26,545
Most people get bloody murdered,
they stay that way.

122
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,379
Not this one.

123
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,419
Yeah, I didn't have much say in that.

124
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,549
He comes back and keeps fighting.

125
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:39,011
Here, north of the Wall,
and then back here again.

126
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,394
He keeps fighting. He keeps fighting.

127
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,021
He climbed on a fucking dragon
and fought.

128
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,062
What kind of person
climbs on a fucking dragon?

129
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:51,365
A madman or a king!

130
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,711
- Drink.
- Drink.

131
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,667
Drink.

132
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,539
Wrong!

133
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,709
Wrong, wrong, wrong! Drink!

134
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,082
Mmm!

135
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,337
You were married. Before Sansa.

136
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,926
Drink.

137
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,721
You're drinking wine,
but you prefer ale!

138
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,676
No!

139
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:15,695
You're a virgin.

140
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,160
That's a statement about the present.

141
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,039
At no point in the past,
up until this very moment,

142
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,915
have you slept with a man.

143
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:30,710
Or a woman.

144
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,263
I have to piss.

145
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:43,010
We did it! We faced those icy fucks.

146
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:46,939
Looked right into their blue eyes,
and here we are.

147
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,610
Now, which one of you cowards
shit in my pants?

148
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,112
Please pardon me for a moment.

149
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,346
Drink it!

150
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,743
And after all that,

151
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,539
this fucker comes north
and takes her from me.

152
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,116
Just takes her, like that.

153
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,665
I mean it, Clegane.

154
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,418
My heart is broken.

155
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,839
Don't touch me.

156
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,416
You can touch me.

157
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,503
I'm not afraid of wildlings.

158
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,304
Maybe you should be.

159
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,140
Well, Clegane...

160
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,556
it's time to drown our sorrows.

161
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,437
I'm not done with my drink.

162
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,356
You saved the day.

163
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:17,007
You owe me one.

164
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:20,365
- Don't forget that.
- For the rest of my days.

165
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:22,947
Are you ready now?

166
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,320
This is my drink.

167
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:43,256
She could have made you happy,
for a little while.

168
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,768
There's only one thing
that'll make me happy.

169
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:53,015
- And what's that?
- That's my fucking business.

170
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,820
Used to be you couldn't look at me.

171
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,277
That was a long time ago.

172
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,489
I've seen much worse than you
since then.

173
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,199
Yes, I've heard.

174
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,656
Heard you were broken in.

175
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,250
Heard you were broken in rough.

176
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:17,165
And he got what he deserved.
I gave it to him.

177
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,548
How?

178
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:21,919
Hounds.

179
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,682
You've changed, little bird.

180
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,229
None of it would have happened
if you'd left King's Landing with me.

181
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,278
No Littlefinger, no Ramsay...

182
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,198
none of it.

183
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,250
Without Littlefinger,
and Ramsay and the rest,

184
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,749
I would have stayed
a little bird all my life.

185
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,897
- Hey!
- Pour another one.

186
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,399
Hey!

187
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,334
Don't shoot.

188
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,872
It's nighttime, it's freezing,
and everyone's celebrating.

189
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,502
You should be celebrating with them.

190
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:44,835
I am celebrating.

191
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,213
Yeah, I am, too.

192
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,138
I'm not Gendry Rivers anymore.

193
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,313
I'm Gendry Baratheon,
Lord of Storm's End.

194
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,356
By order of the queen.

195
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:01,644
Congratulations.

196
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,023
I don't know how to be
lord of anything.

197
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,653
I hardly know how to use a fork.

198
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,862
All I know is that you're beautiful,
and I love you,

199
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,949
and none of it will be worth anything
if you're not with me.

200
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,416
So be with me.

201
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:25,342
Be my wife.
Be the Lady of Storm's End.

202
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,198
You'll be a wonderful lord,

203
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,157
and any lady
would be lucky to have you.

204
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,989
But I'm not a lady.

205
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,787
I never have been.

206
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,253
That's not me.

207
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,651
You didn't drink.

208
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,277
- I didn't drink?
- In the game.

209
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:38,832
- I drank.
- In the game. This is Dornish.

210
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:45,209
This is not the game.
This is only drinking.

211
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,332
Suit yourself.

212
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,262
Well, you keep it warm enough in here.

213
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,438
It's the first thing I learnt
when I came to the North.

214
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,444
Keep your fire going.

215
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,078
Every time you leave the room,
put more wood on.

216
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,733
Well, that's very diligent.
Very responsible.

217
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,614
- Piss off.
- You know the first thing

218
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,820
I learned in the North?

219
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,660
I hate the fucking North.

220
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,162
It grows on you.

221
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,329
I don't want things growing on me.

222
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,920
How about Tormund Giantsbane?

223
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,547
Has he grown on you?

224
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,005
He was very sad when you left.

225
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,558
You sound quite jealous.

226
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,231
I do, don't I?

227
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,566
It's bloody hot in here.

228
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,948
Oh, move aside.

229
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,670
What are you doing?

230
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,877
I'm taking your shirt off.

231
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,265
I've never slept with a knight before.

232
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:04,094
I've never slept with anyone before.

233
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,849
Then you have to drink.
Those are the rules.

234
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,976
I told you...

235
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,704
Are you drunk?

236
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:33,964
No.

237
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:39,675
Only a little.

238
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,104
I didn't know Ser Jorah well...

239
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,686
but I know this.

240
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,904
If he could have chosen a way to die,
it would have been protecting you.

241
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,659
He loved me.

242
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,115
And I couldn't love him back.

243
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,164
Not the way he wanted.

244
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,587
Not the way I love you.

245
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,887
Is that all right?

246
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,754
I wish you'd never told me.

247
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,802
If I didn't know,
I'd be happy right now.

248
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,389
I try to forget.

249
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,350
Tonight I did for a while,

250
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:15,149
and then I saw them
gathered around you.

251
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,394
I saw the way they looked at you.

252
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,443
I know that look.

253
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:26,077
So many people have looked at me
that way, but never here.

254
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,579
Never on this side of the sea.

255
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:31,033
I told you I don't want it.

256
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,913
It doesn't matter what you want.

257
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,204
You didn't want to be
King in the North.

258
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,109
What happens when they demand
you press your claim,

259
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,795
and take what is mine?

260
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,512
I'll refuse.

261
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,720
You are my queen.
I don't know what else I can say.

262
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,892
You can say nothing.

263
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,594
To anyone, ever.

264
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,350
Never tell them who you really are.

265
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:56,024
Swear your brother
and Samwell Tarly to secrecy,

266
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,600
and tell no one else.

267
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,732
Or it will take on a life of its own
and you won't be able to control it

268
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,233
or what it does to people.

269
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,782
No matter how many times
you bend the knee,

270
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,825
no matter what you swear.

271
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,959
I want it to be the way it was
between us.

272
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,633
I have to tell Sansa and Arya.

273
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:32,890
Sansa will want to see me gone
and you on the Iron Throne.

274
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,061
She won't.

275
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,980
She's not the girl you grew up with.

276
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,691
Not after what she's seen,

277
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,236
not after what they've done to her.

278
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:47,529
I owe them the truth.

279
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,036
Even if the truth destroys us?

280
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,864
- It won't.
- It will.

281
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,201
I've never begged for anything...

282
00:29:58,422 --> 00:29:59,788
but I'm begging you.

283
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,716
Don't do this. Please.

284
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,925
You are my queen.

285
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,099
Nothing will change that.

286
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,773
And they are my family.

287
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,353
We can live together.

288
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,493
We can.

289
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,197
I've just told you how.

290
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:11,613
Half are gone.

291
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:16,952
The Northmen as well.

292
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:27,425
And the Golden Company
has arrived in King's Landing,

293
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,298
courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet.

294
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:32,506
The balance has grown
distressingly even.

295
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,433
When the people find out
what we have done for them,

296
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,392
that we saved them...

297
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,471
Cersei will make sure
they don't believe it.

298
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,815
We will hit her hard.

299
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,485
We will rip her out root and stem.

300
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,610
The objective here is to remove Cersei

301
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,691
without destroying King's Landing.

302
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,873
Thankfully,
she is losing allies by the day.

303
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:03,624
Yara Greyjoy has retaken
the Iron Islands in her queen's name.

304
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,456
The new Prince of Dorne
pledges his support.

305
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,758
No matter how many lords
turn against her,

306
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,380
as long as she sits
on the Iron Throne,

307
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,213
she can call herself
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

308
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,511
We need the capital.

309
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,343
I watched the people
of King's Landing

310
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,395
rebel against their king
when they were hungry,

311
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,473
and that was before winter began.

312
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,276
Give them the opportunity
and they will cast Cersei aside.

313
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,776
We'll surround the city.

314
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,775
If the Iron Fleet
tries to ferry in more food,

315
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,485
the dragons will destroy them.

316
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,530
If the Lannisters
and the Golden Company attack,

317
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,205
we'll defeat them in the field.

318
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,126
Once the people see
that Cersei is our only enemy,

319
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:45,415
her reign is over.

320
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,217
All right.

321
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,971
The men we have left
are exhausted.

322
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,431
Many of them are wounded.

323
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,601
They'll fight better if they have
time to rest and recuperate.

324
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,104
How long do you suggest?

325
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,684
I can't say for certain,
not without talking to the officers.

326
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:14,024
I came north to fight alongside you

327
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,734
at great cost to my armies and myself.

328
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:22,206
Now that the time has come
to reciprocate, you want to postpone.

329
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,201
It's not just our people. It's yours.

330
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:29,039
You want to throw them into a war
they're not ready to fight?

331
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:32,341
The longer I leave my enemies alone,
the stronger they become.

332
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,882
The Northern forces
will honor their promises

333
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:43,303
and their allegiance
to the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

334
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,567
What you command, we will obey.

335
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:56,361
So...

336
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:59,285
if all are in agreement...

337
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:03,160
Jon and Ser Davos
will ride down the Kingsroad

338
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,286
with the Northern troops

339
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:07,084
and the bulk of the remaining
Dothraki and Unsullied.

340
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,038
A smaller group of us
will ride to White Harbor,

341
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,542
and sail from there to Dragonstone

342
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:15,217
with our queen and her dragons
accompanying us from above.

343
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:20,264
Ser Jaime has chosen to remain here,
as a guest of the Lady of Winterfell.

344
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:25,219
We have won the Great War.

345
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,938
Now we will win the Last War.

346
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,271
In all Seven Kingdoms,

347
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:34,104
men will live without fear and cruelty

348
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,814
under their rightful queen.

349
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,253
We need a word.

350
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,093
You understand we'd all be dead
if not for her.

351
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,846
We'd be corpses
marching down to King's Landing.

352
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,451
Arya's the one
that killed the Night King.

353
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,467
Her men gave their lives
defending Winterfell...

354
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:05,802
And we will never forget them.

355
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,999
That doesn't mean
that I want to kneel to someone who...

356
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,686
I swore myself and the North
to her cause.

357
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,982
I respect that.

358
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,195
You respect it?

359
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:18,568
We needed her.

360
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,118
We needed her army, her dragons.

361
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,325
You did the right thing.

362
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,283
And we're doing the right thing
telling you

363
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,788
we don't trust your queen.

364
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,252
- You don't know her yet.
- I'll never know her.

365
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,583
She's not one of us.

366
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,542
If you only trust the people
you grew up with,

367
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:39,844
you won't make many allies.

368
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,010
That's all right.

369
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,134
I don't need many allies.

370
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:46,013
- Arya...
- We're family.

371
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,519
The four of us.

372
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,264
The last of the Starks.

373
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:56,978
I've never been a Stark.

374
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:58,946
You are.

375
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,282
You're just as much Ned Stark's child
as any of us.

376
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:04,118
You're my brother.

377
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,204
Not my half-brother
or my bastard brother.

378
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,331
My brother.

379
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,340
It's your choice.

380
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,553
I need to tell you something.

381
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:33,185
But you have to swear
you'll never tell another soul.

382
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,484
What is it?

383
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,818
You have to swear it,
before I tell you.

384
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:45,447
How can I promise to keep a secret
if I don't even know what it is?

385
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:46,948
Because we're family.

386
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,374
Swear it.

387
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:55,627
I swear it.

388
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:01,758
I swear it.

389
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,010
Tell them.

390
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,572
So she's going to stay here with you?

391
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,286
She's sworn to protect
the Stark girls, so...

392
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:34,742
Say something snide.

393
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:36,876
I'm happy.

394
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,625
I'm happy that you're happy.

395
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:44,882
I'm happy that you'll finally
have to climb for it.

396
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,224
Do you know how long I've waited
to tell tall-person jokes?

397
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:52,972
To climbing mountains.

398
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,308
To climbing mountains.

399
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,146
- What's she like down there?
- What?

400
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,937
That's not your concern.

401
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,694
I haven't been with a woman for years.

402
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,241
- Give me a morsel.
- You're a dog.

403
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,410
I am the Imp, and I demand to know.

404
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:11,613
I knew you were fucking her.

405
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,999
A pair of tall, blond toffs.

406
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,791
Must be like looking in the mirror.

407
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,414
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

408
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,296
Where's your drink?

409
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,153
What are you...
What are you doing up North?

410
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:25,509
What are you doing with that?

411
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:26,676
Oh, this?

412
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,879
This is for you.

413
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,010
For both of you.

414
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,217
You're supposed to be south.

415
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,519
You boys are a pair
of gold-plated cunts.

416
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:36,874
- Do you know that?
- That's a bit rude.

417
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,015
Year after year,
I've shoveled Lannister shit,

418
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,224
and what do I have to show?

419
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,900
You're a knight, thanks to me.

420
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,773
Thanks to me.
And that title's worth as much

421
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,729
as a blond hair
from your brother's ballsack.

422
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,531
Power resides where men believe...

423
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,233
Shut your mouth.

424
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,972
- I'm just trying...
- I've never hit a dwarf before,

425
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,113
but say another word
and I will belt you.

426
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:55,743
See, I don't believe you'd do that.

427
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,230
You couldn't do it on your best day,
you one-handed fuck.

428
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,620
And your best days are long gone.

429
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,921
You broke my nose!

430
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,902
- I did not break your nose.
- How do you know?

431
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:07,168
Because I've been breaking noses
since I was your size,

432
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:09,299
and I know what it sounds like.
Now listen.

433
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,593
Your sister offered me Riverrun.

434
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,801
Nice big castle, good lands,

435
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,372
plenty of peasants
who do what they're told.

436
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:17,762
And you trust Cersei...

437
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,473
I knew your sister was dead
the second I saw those dragons.

438
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,108
Now, your army may be torn to shit,

439
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,106
but I'd still bet
on your Dragon Queen to win.

440
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,571
And it just so happens
I'm a betting man.

441
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,700
If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up.

442
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:36,371
And that's good.
Of course, the odds change

443
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,540
if the Dragon Queen's Hand
turns up dead.

444
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,585
Maybe a few of her top generals
get picked off one by one.

445
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,378
- All of a sudden...
- May I speak?

446
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:46,002
Why not? Only death will shut you up.

447
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,220
We made a deal long ago.
Do you remember?

448
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:55,425
If anyone offered me money
to kill you, you'd pay me double.

449
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,351
What's double Riverrun?

450
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,603
Highgarden.

451
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,265
You could be Lord of the Reach.

452
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,022
- Highgarden? Are you mad?
- It's better than being dead.

453
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,900
He's not going to kill us.
He wouldn't be talking to us if...

454
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,529
The way I see it,

455
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,577
I only need
one of the Lannister brothers alive.

456
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,409
Highgarden will never belong
to a cutthroat.

457
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,616
No? Who were your ancestors,

458
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,834
the ones who made your family rich?

459
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,503
Fancy lads in silk?

460
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,171
They were fucking cutthroats.

461
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,874
That's how all the great houses
started, isn't it?

462
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,381
With a hard bastard
who was good at killing people.

463
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:33,508
Kill a few hundred people,
they make you a lord.

464
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,760
Kill a few thousand,
they make you king.

465
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:40,311
And then all your cocksucking
grandsons can ruin the family

466
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,807
with their cocksucking ways.

467
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,649
Highgarden.

468
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,527
Give me your word.

469
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,232
You have my word.

470
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,450
None of this means a thing
until we take King's Landing.

471
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,411
We ride south in the morning.

472
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:05,578
We could use an officer with
knowledge of the city's defenses.

473
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:06,958
Oh, no.

474
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,005
No, my fighting days are done.

475
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,592
But I still got a few
killing days left, you hear me?

476
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,466
I'll come find you
when the war is done.

477
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,798
Till then, don't die.

478
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,700
For fuck's sake.

479
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:47,335
On your own?

480
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:50,084
Not anymore.

481
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,167
I don't like crowds.

482
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:55,927
Me neither.

483
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:59,260
Why not? They all love you now.

484
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,966
You're the big hero.

485
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,310
Don't like heroes.

486
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:09,100
It must have felt good sticking
a knife in that horned fucker.

487
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:11,936
Felt better than dying.

488
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,274
You're heading to King's Landing?

489
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,485
I have some unfinished business.

490
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,287
Me too.

491
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,922
I don't plan on coming back.

492
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:35,509
Neither do I.

493
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,967
Gonna leave me to die again
if I get hurt?

494
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,307
Probably.

495
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:28,436
My lady.

496
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:35,436
"My lord" is the standard response.

497
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,947
Why her?

498
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,994
You know
she loves your brother.

499
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,748
That doesn't mean
she'll be a good queen.

500
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,368
You seem determined to dislike her.

501
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,706
A good relationship
between the Iron Throne and the North

502
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,759
has been the core of every peaceful,
prosperous reign we've ever known.

503
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:02,634
Jon will be Warden of the North,
so a good relationship seems likely.

504
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,684
I don't expect him to spend
much time here going forward.

505
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,386
Well, I suppose that's up to him.

506
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:15,351
Sansa, look at me.

507
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,570
With Jon in the capital,
you'll be the true power in the North.

508
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:29,164
I'd feel much better about the future
if I left here today

509
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,207
believing that you and Daenerys
were allies.

510
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:34,913
What are you worried about?
Jon's taking our army with him.

511
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:37,794
- Your queen still has her dragons...
- She's your queen, too.

512
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,673
You don't have to be her friend.

513
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,637
But why provoke her?

514
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,474
How is that in the best interest
of your family,

515
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:53,556
- or the North, or...?
- You're afraid of her.

516
00:44:56,527 --> 00:45:00,271
Every good ruler
needs to inspire a bit of fear.

517
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,776
I don't want Jon to go down there.

518
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,738
The men in my family
don't do well in the capital.

519
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:13,075
No, but as your brother once told me,
he's not a Stark.

520
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,499
Are you all right?

521
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:29,808
Her people love her, you've seen that.

522
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:32,227
You've seen how they fight for her.

523
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:35,647
She wants to make the world
a better place.

524
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:39,063
I believe in her.

525
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:55,624
Tyrion.

526
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,373
What if there's someone else?

527
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,674
Someone better?

528
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,476
You're not gonna
ride the dragon south?

529
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:18,315
Just a horse.

530
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:20,938
Rhaegal needs to heal.

531
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,065
He doesn't need me weighing him down.

532
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,981
You weigh as much
as two fleas fucking.

533
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:29,200
I'm taking the Free Folk home.

534
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:32,116
We've had enough of the south.

535
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:34,869
The women down here don't like me.

536
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:38,744
This is the North, you know.

537
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,748
And the Free Folk are welcome to stay.

538
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:45,383
It isn't home.

539
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,669
We need room to wander.

540
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,949
I'll take them back
through Castle Black

541
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,761
as soon as the winter storms pass.

542
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:53,846
Back where we belong.

543
00:46:58,107 --> 00:46:59,814
It's where he belongs, too.

544
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,567
A direwolf has no place in the south.

545
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,737
Will you take him with you?

546
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,403
He'll be happier up there.

547
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,285
So would you.

548
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,114
I wish I was going with you.

549
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:22,288
This is farewell, then.

550
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,291
You never know.

551
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,015
You've got the North in you.

552
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:36,972
The real North.

553
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:12,630
Yes, well, um,
the nights have been getting longer

554
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,841
and there wasn't that much
to do in Oldtown.

555
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:18,097
There's only so many books
a person can read, so we...

556
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:20,930
I'm sure he knows how it happens, Sam.

557
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,731
If it's a boy,
we want to name him "Jon."

558
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:31,527
I hope it's a girl.

559
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,551
You're the best friend I ever had.

560
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,264
You too, Sam.

561
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,911
Think of the past 20 years.

562
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:03,365
The war, the murder, the misery.

563
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,326
All of it because Robert Baratheon
loved someone

564
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,286
who didn't love him back.

565
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,585
How many others know?

566
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:16,135
Including us? Eight.

567
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:18,179
Well, then it's not a secret anymore.

568
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,676
It's information.

569
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:23,469
If a handful of people know now,
hundreds will know soon.

570
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,848
Then what happens?

571
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:26,680
She loses the North.

572
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:29,482
She loses the Vale,
Sansa will make sure of that.

573
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,104
No, it's worse than that.

574
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:32,777
He has the better claim to the throne.

575
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:35,693
He doesn't want the throne.

576
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:38,234
I'm not sure it matters what he wants.

577
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:42,746
The fact is, people are drawn to him.

578
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:44,823
Wildlings, Northmen.

579
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:48,167
He's a war hero.

580
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:54,044
He loves our queen.

581
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,544
And she loves him.

582
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:02,432
If we marry them,
they could rule together.

583
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:04,559
She's his aunt.

584
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:06,039
That never stopped a Targaryen before.

585
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,725
No, but Jon grew up in Winterfell.

586
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:09,898
Is marrying your aunt
common in the North?

587
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,356
You know our queen better than I do.

588
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,126
Do you think
she wants to share the throne?

589
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,033
She does not like to have
her authority questioned.

590
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:22,782
Something she has in common
with every monarch who ever lived.

591
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:25,705
I worry about her state of mind.

592
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:27,957
We are advisors to the queen.

593
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:31,252
Worrying about her state of mind
is our job.

594
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,429
We still have to take King's Landing.

595
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:44,641
Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all.

596
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,843
That would solve our problems.

597
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,432
Get to the skiff. Now!

598
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:56,560
Spears!

599
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,562
They're coming round again!

600
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,114
Go!

601
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,445
Clear!

602
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,122
No!

603
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:33,718
- Go!
- Clear!

604
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,472
Missandei?

605
00:55:12,935 --> 00:55:14,346
Missandei!

606
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:21,725
Missandei!

607
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,819
Our message
was well-received, then?

608
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:32,118
Your people have heard
the usurper is coming.

609
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:37,074
They are grateful for your protection
within the walls of the Red Keep.

610
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,747
You're certain about the dragon?

611
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:43,630
I saw it sink beneath the waves.

612
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,790
That must have been glorious.

613
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,386
The glory is yours, my queen.

614
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:54,136
When the war is won,
the Lion shall rule the land,

615
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:55,967
the Kraken shall rule the sea...

616
00:55:57,563 --> 00:56:00,556
and our child
shall one day rule them all.

617
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,081
She's coming for you.

618
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:21,459
Of course she is.

619
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,917
Keep the gates open.

620
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:28,653
If she wants to take the castle,
she'll have to murder

621
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:30,885
thousands of innocent people first.

622
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:39,428
So much for the "Breaker of Chains."

623
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,822
We will storm the city,
my queen.

624
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:58,656
We will kill your enemies.
All of them.

625
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,414
Your Grace.

626
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,749
I promised you I would look you
in the eye and speak directly

627
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,922
if I ever thought
you were making a mistake.

628
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:13,924
This is a mistake.

629
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:19,350
You saw my child fall from the sky.

630
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:22,432
They took Missandei.

631
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,230
Cersei needs to be destroyed,

632
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:29,311
but if we attack King's Landing
with Drogon and the Unsullied

633
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:33,023
and the Dothraki, tens of thousands
of innocents will die.

634
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:36,610
That is why Cersei
is bringing them into the Red Keep.

635
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:41,073
These are the people
you came here to protect.

636
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,120
I beg you, Your Grace.

637
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:46,544
Do not destroy the city
you came to save.

638
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:50,794
Do not become what you
have always struggled to defeat.

639
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:58,014
Do you believe we're here
for a reason, Lord Varys?

640
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:05,271
I'm here to free the world
from tyrants.

641
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,103
That is my destiny...

642
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,936
and I will serve it,
no matter the cost.

643
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,909
It could be a fortnight
before Jon and the allied armies

644
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:23,206
make it to King's Landing.

645
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:27,084
In the meantime,
demand Cersei's surrender.

646
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:30,334
Offer her her life
in exchange for the throne.

647
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:34,463
If there's a chance
to avoid the coming slaughter,

648
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:36,294
we should make the effort.

649
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,342
Speaking to Cersei
will not prevent a slaughter.

650
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:44,014
But perhaps it's good the people see

651
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:47,814
that Daenerys Stormborn made
every effort to avoid bloodshed,

652
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:50,186
and Cersei Lannister refused.

653
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:55,196
They should know whom to blame
when the sky falls down upon them.

654
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:12,334
I've served tyrants most of my life.

655
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,754
They all talk about destiny.

656
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:19,925
She's a girl who walked into a fire
with three stones

657
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:22,632
and walked out with three dragons.

658
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:25,469
How could she not believe in destiny?

659
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,554
Perhaps that's the problem.

660
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:30,640
Her life has convinced her that
she was sent here to save us all.

661
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:32,566
And how do you know she wasn't?

662
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,687
Then there's the problem of Jon Snow.

663
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:46,079
Perhaps it's actually a solution.

664
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:49,079
You know them both.

665
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:52,207
Tell me, who do you think
would make a better ruler?

666
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,434
He doesn't want the throne.

667
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,925
That's why he bent the knee.

668
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,135
Have you considered the best ruler

669
01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:05,933
might be someone
who doesn't want to rule?

670
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,012
We're discussing treason.

671
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,828
Don't pretend
you haven't thought about it.

672
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,692
Of course I've thought about it.
Thoughts aren't treason.

673
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:19,652
He's temperate and measured.

674
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:23,906
He's a man, which makes him more
appealing to the lords of Westeros,

675
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:25,452
whose support we are going to need.

676
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,205
Joffrey was a man.

677
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,248
I don't think a cock
is a true qualification,

678
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,416
as I'm sure you'd agree.

679
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:33,586
And he's the heir to the throne.

680
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:37,461
Yes, because he's a man.
Cocks are important, I'm afraid.

681
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,636
What about my earlier proposal?

682
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:45,715
They could rule together
as king and queen.

683
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,051
She's too strong for him.

684
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:53,389
She'd bend him to her will,
as she already has.

685
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:56,066
He could temper her worst impulses.

686
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:57,943
As you have?

687
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,191
You're drinking quite a lot.

688
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:09,201
A Targaryen father and a Stark mother.

689
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,744
Jon's the one man alive

690
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:14,873
who might actually be able to keep
the North in the Seven Kingdoms.

691
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:16,440
How many kings and queens
have you served?

692
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:17,750
Five? Six? I've lost count.

693
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:20,003
- You've always known my reasons.
- At a certain point,

694
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,693
you choose a person you believe in,
and you fight for that person.

695
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:25,179
Even if you know it's a mistake?

696
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,799
I believe in our queen.

697
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,845
She'll make the right choice.

698
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:37,934
With the help of her loyal advisors.

699
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,073
You know where my loyalty stands.

700
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:46,492
You know I will never
betray the realm.

701
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:48,069
What is the realm?

702
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:49,995
A vast continent,
home to millions of people,

703
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:52,198
most of whom don't care
who sits on the Iron Throne.

704
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:54,124
Millions of people,
many of whom will die

705
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,419
if the wrong person
sits on that throne.

706
01:01:57,172 --> 01:02:00,131
We don't know their names,
but they're just as real as you and I.

707
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:01,503
They deserve to live.

708
01:02:01,593 --> 01:02:03,425
They deserve food for their children.

709
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:11,134
I will act in their interest,
no matter the personal cost.

710
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:15,855
So, what happens to her?

711
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:24,823
Please.

712
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:28,868
Don't.

713
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,658
I've spoken as honestly as I can.

714
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:39,662
Each of us has a choice to make.

715
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:43,250
I pray we choose wisely.

716
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:01,911
All right,
I'll put another one on it.

717
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:03,589
He's headed down to the cellar.

718
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:06,822
- I'll need a cart over here.
- That's it, thanks.

719
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:08,740
Thank you.

720
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:20,620
...as are the rest of her advisors.

721
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:24,210
What happened?

722
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,890
Euron Greyjoy ambushed
Queen Daenerys and her fleet.

723
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:37,387
One of the dragons was killed,
several ships destroyed,

724
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,891
Missandei captured.

725
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:44,727
I always wanted to be there
when they execute your sister.

726
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:47,605
Seems like I won't get the chance.

727
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:57,049
They're going to destroy that city.

728
01:04:58,436 --> 01:04:59,927
You know they will.

729
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:02,596
Have you ever
run away from a fight?

730
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:07,018
You're not like your sister.
You're not.

731
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,273
You're better than she is.

732
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:11,856
You're a good man
and you can't save her.

733
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:13,782
You don't need to die with her.

734
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:15,575
Stay here.

735
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,741
Stay with me.

736
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:21,624
Please.

737
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:24,459
Stay.

738
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:32,752
You think I'm a good man?

739
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:41,894
I pushed a boy out a tower window,
crippled him for life

740
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:43,770
for Cersei.

741
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:49,686
I strangled my cousin
with my own hands

742
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:52,780
just to get back to Cersei.

743
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:57,242
I would have murdered

744
01:05:57,579 --> 01:06:00,697
every man, woman and child in Riverrun

745
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:02,706
for Cersei.

746
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:12,962
She's hateful.

747
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,428
And so am I.

748
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:52,668
My lord.

749
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:59,045
Queen Daenerys demands
Cersei's unconditional surrender

750
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,673
and the immediate release
of Missandei of Naath.

751
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:07,554
Queen Cersei demands
Daenerys's unconditional surrender.

752
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:11,516
If she refuses, Missandei of Naath
will die here and now.

753
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:14,564
Qyburn...

754
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:17,817
you're a rational man.

755
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:20,396
Or so I flatter myself, my lord.

756
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:22,359
We have a chance here,

757
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,573
perhaps our last chance,
to avoid carnage.

758
01:09:27,205 --> 01:09:28,286
Yes.

759
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:30,997
Help me.

760
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:34,376
I don't want to see this city burn.

761
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:38,334
I don't want to hear the screams
of children burning alive.

762
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:43,294
No, it is not a pleasant sound.

763
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,760
I... I don't want to hear it.

764
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:50,179
Help me save this city.

765
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:54,805
My lord, I am only a mouthpiece
for our queen.

766
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:56,106
Your queen.

767
01:09:56,818 --> 01:09:58,810
Cersei is Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

768
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:00,019
You are her subject.

769
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:01,729
Her reign is over.

770
01:10:02,407 --> 01:10:04,865
You understand this.
Help her understand it.

771
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:07,364
We understand nothing of the sort.

772
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:11,030
Your queen's last dragon
is vulnerable.

773
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:14,290
Your armies
are battle-weary and depleted,

774
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:17,791
while ours have been reinforced
with the Golden Compan...

775
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:36,517
Ready!

776
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:38,815
Nock!

777
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:42,770
Draw!

778
01:11:49,347 --> 01:11:52,090
I know you don't care
about your people.

779
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:55,308
Why should you?

780
01:11:57,355 --> 01:12:00,189
They hate you and you hate them.

781
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:08,397
But you're not a monster.

782
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,075
I know this.

783
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:16,496
I know this because I've seen it.

784
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:23,332
You've always loved your children.

785
01:12:25,383 --> 01:12:27,796
More than yourself...

786
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:29,251
...more than Jaime...

787
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:33,550
more than anything.

788
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:37,726
I beg you.

789
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:43,482
If not for yourself,
then for your child.

790
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:48,983
Your reign is over,

791
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:52,570
but that doesn't mean
your life has to end.

792
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,493
It doesn't mean your baby has to die.

793
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:49,923
If you have any last words,
now is the time.

794
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:16,403
<i>Dracarys.</i>

795
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:27,126
No.
