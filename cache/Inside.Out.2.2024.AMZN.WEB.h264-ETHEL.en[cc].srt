We'll see you tomorrow.

You are such an all-star!

170
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,830
You are gonna knock
the coach's skates off!

171
00:07:17,966 --> 00:07:20,234
Hockey scholarship,
here we come!

172
00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:21,105
Dad, stop.

173
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,901
It's just hockey camp.

174
00:07:23,037 --> 00:07:25,334
I mean,
who knows what'll happen?

175

- [Sadness whimpering]

177
00:07:31,178 --> 00:07:33,848
My penalty almost lost us
the game today.

178
00:07:33,983 --> 00:07:35,911
What if I get to camp
and I screw it up?

179
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:37,311
Hey, don't talk like that.

180
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:39,684
Yeah,
you did great today, honey.

181
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:41,959
Exactly. Mom gets it.

182
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,622
Yeah, I guess.

183
00:07:43,757 --> 00:07:45,396
We're so proud of you.

184
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,225
Night, monkey.

186

[sighs]

189
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,706
Oh, Riley's so hard on herself.

190
00:07:58,842 --> 00:08:01,007
But we can make
everything easier.

191
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,476
[grunts]

192
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:04,746

Don't look, it's fine.

195
00:08:09,818 --> 00:08:11,322
This is for all those memories

196
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,619
that belong
in the Back of the Mind,

197
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:15,220
like this penalty one.

198
00:08:15,355 --> 00:08:18,095
It's weighing on her,
so let's lighten the load.

A one-way expressway to,

"We're not gonna think
about that right now." Whoo!

201
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,000
- [Anger] Not bad.
- [Sadness] Oh, Joy.

202
00:08:27,136 --> 00:08:28,097
- That's pretty impressive.
- You worked hard.

203
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:30,469
You take such good care
of Riley.

204
00:08:30,605 --> 00:08:31,999
Thanks, I try.

205
00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:34,104
Okay, let's do a sweep.

206
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,876
Oh, here's one
where she waved at a guy

207
00:08:36,012 --> 00:08:38,075
who was actually waving
at a girl behind her.

208
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:40,244
Oh, that was so bad.
Good choice.

209
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,013
Oh, here's when she forgot
that girl's name.

210
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,319
Oh, yeah,
that was super awkward.

211
00:08:44,454 --> 00:08:45,423
What was her name?

212
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,790
I don't know,
Janet or something?

213
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,516
Whatever. Let's just
get rid of it. Oh! [chuckles]

214
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:52,789
We keep the best
and toss the rest. [sighs]

215
00:08:52,925 --> 00:08:54,263
Nice work, everyone.

216
00:08:54,398 --> 00:08:55,390
All right, Anger,

217
00:08:55,525 --> 00:08:57,129
the rest of these babies
can go to long-term.

218
00:09:04,037 --> 00:09:05,967
Oh, okay.
Let's get some shut-eye.

219
00:09:06,102 --> 00:09:07,678
Big day tomorrow.

220
00:09:14,485 --> 00:09:16,344
Joy, are you taking that

221
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,983
where I think
you're taking that?

222
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:21,421
- Wanna come this time?
- Yes.

223
00:09:21,556 --> 00:09:22,491
I mean no. I...

224
00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:24,922
Oh, no. I really shouldn't.

225
00:09:25,058 --> 00:09:26,124
You know, you're the only one

226
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,958
who hasn't been
to the Belief System.

227
00:09:28,094 --> 00:09:29,599
Yeah, it's just that it's new,

228
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:31,460
and I know how important it is.

229
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:34,735
And I don't wanna mess it up
or break it,

230
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:37,102
or burn it to the ground
or anything.

231
00:09:37,238 --> 00:09:39,775
Sadness, you won't hurt it,
I promise.

232
00:09:39,911 --> 00:09:41,475
Have I ever
steered you wrong before?

233
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,441
Yeah, many times.

234
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:44,576
Come on.

00:14:05,972 --> 00:14:07,245
[sobbing]

325
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,078
[sniffing]

326
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,708
Let the professional
handle this.

327
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:18,920
I'm too gross to go to camp
or anywhere ever again!

328
00:14:19,055 --> 00:14:20,618
Oh, yeah,
this is totally broken.

329
00:14:21,588 --> 00:14:23,622
Well, we all knew
this day would come.

330
00:14:23,758 --> 00:14:26,326
Remember, we agreed not to
make a big deal about this.

331
00:14:26,461 --> 00:14:27,925
- But she really does stink.
- [all agree]

332
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:29,164
Oh, it's bad.

333
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:32,030
Remain calm.
Stick to the prepared script.

334
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,571
You are not gross, honey.

335
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:36,730
You're just changing.

336
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:38,202
Remember that
beautiful butterfly

337
00:14:38,338 --> 00:14:39,968
we saw in the park last week?

338
00:14:40,104 --> 00:14:41,543
[echoing] <i>Well, that butterfly
began as a caterpillar.</i>

339
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,871
[Joy] Easy...

340
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:43,741
[Mom] <i>And just like
that caterpillar...</i>

341
00:14:43,877 --> 00:14:44,982
Easy...

342
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,314
<i>...you're about to
get your wings.</i>

343
00:14:46,449 --> 00:14:47,946
- But if you have questions...
- Oh, my gosh, Mom!

344
00:14:48,081 --> 00:14:50,845
Just go away! Ugh!

345
00:14:50,981 --> 00:14:54,515
Well, that's a preview
of the next 10 years.

346
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:56,027
- Riley!
- Oh, my gosh!

347
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,155
- We're gonna have so much fun!
- [Dad] All right.

348
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,463
Who's ready for hockey camp?

349
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:00,657
[girls] Oh, yeah!

350
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:02,165
[Joy] <i>Okay, until we can
figure this out,</i>

351
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,233
nobody touch the console
unless you really need to.

352
00:15:06,534 --> 00:15:09,237
So, big weekend for us.
What do you wanna do?

353
00:15:09,373 --> 00:15:11,073
Well, we could finally
clean out the garage.

354
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,942
Or, actually,
we can get upstairs...

355
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,070
How great is next year gonna be?

356
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,816
Coach Roberts' team has been
state champs like every year.

357
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:22,185
And Val Ortiz
is the captain now.

358
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,289
This Valentina Ortiz obsession
is outta control.

359
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,019
Uh, she made the Fire Hawks
when she was only a freshman.

360
00:15:28,155 --> 00:15:29,885
That's really hard.

361
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,054
All we have to do
is be super awesome at camp,

362
00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:36,758
Coach will put us on the team,
and we'll all be Fire Hawks!

363
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,330
- Wait, what was that?
- What was what?

364
00:15:38,466 --> 00:15:40,571
We got a look.
I don't like this.

365
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:41,835
What? You're paranoid.

366
00:15:41,971 --> 00:15:43,304
I never miss a look.

367
00:15:46,274 --> 00:15:48,007
[Disgust] Enhance 224... 176.

368
00:15:48,142 --> 00:15:50,238
Track right. Zoom in.

369
00:15:50,373 --> 00:15:52,210
Right there!

370
00:15:52,345 --> 00:15:54,517
- So?
- She's hiding something.

371
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:56,053
But what?

372
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,590
What is she doing?

373
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:00,856
She's looking at our look!

374
00:16:00,992 --> 00:16:03,753
No, it's much more than that.

375
00:16:06,227 --> 00:16:07,454
She looks the same to me.

376
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,825
Overlay and compare.

377
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:12,465
See? Riley then, Riley now.
Riley then, Riley now.

378
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,429
- [all gasp, exclaim]
- Oh, It's so obvious!

379
00:16:14,564 --> 00:16:16,103
But what does it mean?

380
00:16:16,238 --> 00:16:18,471
She knows
we're hiding something.

381
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,503
What is happening right now?

382
00:16:21,638 --> 00:16:22,572
I don't know! I don't know!

383
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,713
- I can't take this anymore!
- Ah!

384
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:26,447
You spilled the tea!

385
00:16:26,582 --> 00:16:28,517
Coach Roberts isn't gonna be
our coach next year.

386
00:16:28,652 --> 00:16:29,585
Grace!

387
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,747
[whimpers]

388
00:16:32,015 --> 00:16:34,755
We... We got assigned to
a different high school.

389
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,126
A-ha! Oh...

390
00:16:36,693 --> 00:16:38,219
Oh, no.

391
00:16:38,354 --> 00:16:39,397
Oh...

392
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:40,597
Okay. Um...

393
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:42,231
Yeah. No big deal.

394
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:44,525
- This is a huge deal!
- Our life is over!

395
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:45,736
Is she serious right now?

396
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,128
How long have they known this?

397
00:16:47,263 --> 00:16:48,336
- [Fear] I can't breathe.
- We can't go to high school

398
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:50,235
- without Bree and Grace.
- We won't know anybody.

399
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,742
We'll still get to hang out.

400
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,305
And we'll have this weekend,

401
00:16:53,441 --> 00:16:55,107
which means
we'll get one last time

402
00:16:55,243 --> 00:16:56,538
playing on the same team.

403
00:16:56,673 --> 00:16:58,511
Friends are forever, right?

404
00:16:59,376 --> 00:17:01,419
Yeah. Of course.

405
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:02,480
[both] Whoo!

406
00:17:02,616 --> 00:17:03,919
I can't wait to get to the rink.

407
00:17:04,055 --> 00:17:05,088
When do we get our schedules?

408
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,514
[Grace]
I heard our room has a view...

409
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,560
Oh, this is so sad.

410
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,085
No, wait, Sadness!

411
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,460
- No, no, no! Don't!
- I don't have a good grip!

412
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:14,758
Just keep it together
until we're out of the car.

413
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:17,392
[Dad] Here we are.

414
00:17:17,528 --> 00:17:19,500
This looks really cool.

415
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:21,397
Are you sure you don't need
an assistant coach?

416
00:17:21,532 --> 00:17:22,500
'Cause I am available.

417
00:17:22,636 --> 00:17:23,867
- [Mom] Bill.
- [Dad] No? All right.

418
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,408
- We'll see you in a few days.
- [Mom] Have fun!

419
00:17:25,543 --> 00:17:26,767
- [Bree] Thanks so much. Bye!
- Don't miss us too much.

420
00:17:26,902 --> 00:17:28,638
- Okay, bye!
- Wait. Riley,

421
00:17:28,774 --> 00:17:30,008
are you sure
you have everything?

422
00:17:30,144 --> 00:17:31,240
- Stick?
- Yes.

423
00:17:31,376 --> 00:17:32,412
- Gloves?
- Yes.

424
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:33,545
- You have your phone?
- Yes, of course.

425
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,345
- Fully charged?
- Yeah, it's like 50.

426
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,479
- What?
- Dad, it's fine.

427
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:37,984
Okay, call us if you need us.

428
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,051
I love you. Go get 'em.

429
00:17:39,187 --> 00:17:40,221
Okay. Love you guys.

430
00:17:40,357 --> 00:17:42,823
- Don't forget the deodorant!
- Mom!

431
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,161
Bye, monkey.

432
00:17:46,423 --> 00:17:48,693
Okay, now.

433
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,366
[crying]

434
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:56,206
It's okay. We need this.

435
00:17:58,644 --> 00:17:59,638
[sniffles]

436
00:18:00,436 --> 00:18:01,608
[gasps]

437
00:18:01,743 --> 00:18:03,672
[Disgust] <i>Guys,
these are high-schoolers.</i>

438
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:04,748
- Oh...
- We do not wanna be

439
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:05,811
red and puffy, do we?

440
00:18:05,947 --> 00:18:06,974
No.

441
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,678
Don't worry,
we'll have plenty of time

442
00:18:08,814 --> 00:18:10,385
to think about this after camp.

443
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,055
<i>Now, where did
Bree and Grace go?</i>

444
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,651
- Oh! There they are.
- Wait.

445
00:18:14,787 --> 00:18:16,719
Aren't those traitors
dead to us?

446
00:18:16,854 --> 00:18:18,624
Our best friends?
[scoffs] No.

447
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,166
[girl] Whoa! Hey!

448
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:24,500
Are you okay?

449
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:27,035
[gasps] Everybody act regular.
It's Valentina Ortiz.

450
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,738
- Ah!
- We gotta say something.

451
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,906
- Uh...
- Hey.

452
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:32,205
- Hi. I'm Val...
- I know.

453
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,341
You're the varsity captain,

454
00:18:33,476 --> 00:18:35,069
you set the all-time
goal record as a junior,

455
00:18:35,205 --> 00:18:36,537
your favorite color's red,
and your skates...

456
00:18:36,673 --> 00:18:37,648
What are we saying?

457
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,916
We are so uncool.

458
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,877
Why are we
still holding her hand?

459
00:18:41,012 --> 00:18:42,680
Just like me.
[gasps, chuckles nervously]

460
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:44,679
Oh, you're the one
Coach told us about.

461
00:18:44,814 --> 00:18:46,618
Riley, from Michigan, right?

462
00:18:46,754 --> 00:18:48,155
- It's Minnesota, sweetie.
- No, no, no.

463
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,860
We cannot correct Val Ortiz.

464
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,127
[laughs] Yeah, that's me.

465
00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:56,364
Riley from good old Michigan.

466
00:18:56,499 --> 00:18:58,432
Orange?
Who made the console orange?

467
00:18:58,568 --> 00:19:00,234
- Do I look orange?
- I didn't touch it.

468
00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:02,369
- Orange is not my color.
- Not me.

469
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:04,836
- Hello, everybody.
- [all scream]

470
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:07,245
Oh, my gosh. I am just
such a huge fan of yours.

471
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,311
And now, here I am,
meeting you, face to face.

472
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:12,215
[squeals]
Okay. How can I help?

473
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,547
- Uh... [exclaims]
- I can take notes,

474
00:19:13,682 --> 00:19:15,217
get coffee, manage your
calendar, walk your dog,

475
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:16,946
carry your things,
watch you sleep.

476
00:19:17,081 --> 00:19:20,014
Wow! You have a lot of energy.
[chuckles]

477
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,658
Maybe you could just
stay in one place.

478
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:22,853
Anything.

479
00:19:22,988 --> 00:19:24,562
Just call my name,
and I am here for you.

480
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:25,656
Okay, love that.

481
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:27,021
- And what was your name again?
- Oh.

482
00:19:27,156 --> 00:19:28,665
I'm sorry.
I can get ahead of myself.

483
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,726
I'm Anxiety.

484
00:19:29,862 --> 00:19:31,101
I'm one of Riley's new emotions.

485
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,529
And we are just
super-jazzed to be here.

486
00:19:33,665 --> 00:19:34,764
Where can I put my stuff?

487
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,173
Uh-uh-uh.
What do you mean "we"?

488
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,673
[female voice sighs
in exasperation]

489
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:39,903
[female voice] I wish I was as
tall as all of you. [grunts]

490
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:42,272
- Who the heck are you?
- [grunting, panting]

491
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:43,539
I'm Envy.

492
00:19:43,674 --> 00:19:45,742
Oh! Look at your hair.

493
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:47,751
- Oh, yeah, not happening.
- [gasps]

494
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,082
Look at her hair!

495
00:19:49,218 --> 00:19:51,222
We need hair like that.

496
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,824
Oh, my gosh.
I love the red in your hair.

497
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,022
- Oh...
- [Disgust gasps]

498
00:19:55,158 --> 00:19:57,061
What are you doing?

499
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,929
Hey, maybe when I make the team,

500
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,631
I can join Team Redhead, too!

501
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:01,760
Yeah, yeah.

502
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:04,259
[whimpers]

503
00:20:04,395 --> 00:20:05,396
[gasps]

504
00:20:05,531 --> 00:20:06,794
Okay, who's this guy?

505
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:08,696
What's your name, big fella?

506
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,932
That's Embarrassment.

507
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:11,534
He's not really big
on eye contact,

508
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,207
or uh, like, good talking,

509
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:14,542
but he's a really sweet guy.

510
00:20:14,678 --> 00:20:18,078
Well, welcome to Headquarters,
Embarrassment.

511
00:20:18,214 --> 00:20:19,915
Oh, we're doing a... No.

512
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:21,616
No, going high. Oh.

513
00:20:21,752 --> 00:20:23,887
You got a real sweaty palm
there, buddy. [chuckles]

514
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,122
[Embarrassment whimpering]

515
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:26,917
Hey, do you wanna
come with me, actually?

516
00:20:27,052 --> 00:20:28,226
You can meet some of
the other Fire Hawks.

517
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:29,425
[Anxiety] <i>Ooh, this is exciting.</i>

518
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,021
But we can't let her know
we're excited.

519
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,897
Yeah, sounds good.

520
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,391
What emotion was that?

521
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:36,660
That's Ennui.

522
00:20:36,795 --> 00:20:38,536
- An-what?
- [female voice 2 sighs]

523
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:39,828
Ennui.

524
00:20:39,964 --> 00:20:42,533
It's what you would call
the boredom.

525
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:45,007
Well, come on up here, An-wer.

526
00:20:45,142 --> 00:20:46,468
Am I saying it right?

527
00:20:46,603 --> 00:20:47,872
An-wah. No.

528
00:20:48,007 --> 00:20:50,173
Oh, nicknames!
I'm gonna call you Wee-Wee.

529
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:51,381
No.

530
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,115
How are you driving?

531
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:54,952
- Console app.
- [beeps]

532
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,846
Hey! Stop it! That's enough.

533
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:58,948
Now, now, I know new emotions

534
00:20:59,084 --> 00:21:01,851
can sometimes feel
unhelpful at first,

535
00:21:01,987 --> 00:21:03,854
and you just wanna...
[grunting]

536
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,354
say to them,
"Why are you so annoying?"

537
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:11,191
But I've learned that every
emotion is good for Riley.

538
00:21:11,327 --> 00:21:13,231
- Even this turkey.
- [Sadness chuckles]

539
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:14,804
Okay, fine.

540
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,070
[Ennui sighs]

541
00:21:16,206 --> 00:21:17,275
Cool. Lead the way.

542
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,366
All right. Grab your stuff
and follow me.

543
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:21,407
[Sadness] <i>Oh, but what about
our friends?</i>

544
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:23,077
[Envy] <i>Val is our future.</i>

545
00:21:23,213 --> 00:21:24,641
Yes, I agree completely.

546
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:25,843
We need new friends or else

547
00:21:25,979 --> 00:21:27,952
we'll be totally alone
in high school.

548
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:29,076
- Right, Joy?
- Well...

549
00:21:29,212 --> 00:21:30,554
- I mean, maybe, um...
- Here we go!

550
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,813
Wait up.

551
00:21:31,949 --> 00:21:33,550
Thanks for showing me around.

552
00:21:33,686 --> 00:21:34,815
Wait, why did you do that?

553
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,192
Sorry. What did I do?

554
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,056
We just left
our best friends behind.

555
00:21:38,192 --> 00:21:40,159
But what about the new ones
that we're about to meet?

556
00:21:40,294 --> 00:21:41,598
No. Okay.

557
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:44,058
These next three days need
to be about Bree and Grace.

558
00:21:44,194 --> 00:21:46,335
Joy, the next three days
could determine

559
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,264
the next four years
of our lives.

560
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,241
[chuckles] Now, I think that's
overstating things a bit.

561
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:53,809
Ooh, la, la.
Joy is so old school.

562
00:21:53,944 --> 00:21:54,902
What?

563
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:56,507
Look, we all have a job to do.

564
00:21:56,642 --> 00:21:57,706
You make Riley happy,

565
00:21:57,841 --> 00:21:59,076
Sadness makes her sad,

566
00:21:59,212 --> 00:22:00,941
Fear protects her from
the scary stuff she can see,

567
00:22:01,076 --> 00:22:02,747
and my job is to protect her

568
00:22:02,883 --> 00:22:04,647
from the scary stuff
she can't see.

569
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,488
I plan for the future.

570
00:22:06,623 --> 00:22:08,656
Oh, I can show you.
You're gonna love this.

571
00:22:10,555 --> 00:22:11,623
[console beeps]

572
00:22:11,758 --> 00:22:13,121
I was using that
as a cup holder.

573
00:22:13,257 --> 00:22:15,562
Okay, so my team
has run all the data,

574
00:22:15,698 --> 00:22:16,834
and we're looking
at the following

575
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:18,028
likely scenarios.

576
00:22:18,163 --> 00:22:19,897
First, we don't take
this camp seriously,

577
00:22:20,032 --> 00:22:21,130
and we goof off
with Bree and Grace.

578
00:22:21,265 --> 00:22:23,735
Riley looks really uncool
in front of Val.

579
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,866
She fails to impress the coach,

580
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:26,167
does not become a Fire Hawk,

581
00:22:26,302 --> 00:22:28,035
and finally arrives
at high school.

582
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,379
- She has no one.
- [bell ringing]

583
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,574
She eats alone,
and only the teachers

584
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,844
- know her name.
- Ew.

585
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,445
Okay, you and I
are gonna be friends.

586
00:22:34,581 --> 00:22:36,810
Oh, this is a sad story.

587
00:22:36,946 --> 00:22:38,589
It's a ridiculous story.

588
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:41,357
Look, again, love the energy,
but you're being silly.

589
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,124
None of this
will actually happen.

590
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,518
Right. Whatever you say.

591
00:22:44,653 --> 00:22:45,992
- You're the boss. [chuckles]
- [female voice 3] Oh...

592
00:22:46,127 --> 00:22:49,829
Remember when we all finally
came up to Headquarters?

593
00:22:49,964 --> 00:22:52,662
That was like 30 seconds ago,
Nostalgia.

594
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:54,604
Yeah, those were the days.

595
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:57,299
Nostalgia, you aren't supposed
to be here yet.

596
00:22:57,434 --> 00:22:59,906
You still have about 10 years,
two graduations,

597
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:01,411
and a best friend's wedding
before you're invited,

598
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,205
but I will keep you
in the loop, I promise.

599
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,415
- [Valentina] <i>All right...</i>
- Hey, hey...

600
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,747
- <i>you ready, Riley?</i>
- everybody focus!

601
00:23:05,882 --> 00:23:07,880
Val is leading us
into their holy inner sanctum!

602
00:23:08,015 --> 00:23:09,585
- And here we are!
- [indistinct chatter]

603
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:15,355
[Envy] <i>These girls are so cool!</i>

604
00:23:15,491 --> 00:23:16,525
[Disgust] <i>And older.</i>

605
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:17,762
We are not changing
in front of them.

606
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:18,990
It's fine!

607
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:20,521
<i>Locker rooms are places
of mutual respect.</i>

608
00:23:20,657 --> 00:23:23,057
Hey, come on! I want you to
meet the other Fire Hawks.

609
00:23:23,192 --> 00:23:24,358
- Hey, girl!
- What's up?

610
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:25,628
Hey.

611
00:23:25,764 --> 00:23:27,137
Riley is from Michigan.

612
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:29,165
Okay, we're stuck with that.

613
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,142
Oh, Cool. Where in Michigan
are you from?

614
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:33,004
- Uh...
- Oh, no. What now?

615
00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:35,012
Okay, looks like
we're committing to this.

616
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,245
Cities in Michigan...

617
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:37,607
We need to make something up.

618
00:23:37,742 --> 00:23:39,873
I'm from all over.

619
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:41,778
Nice. See you out there.

620
00:23:41,913 --> 00:23:43,047
Hey, you wanna sit with us?

621
00:23:43,183 --> 00:23:44,914
[Anxiety]
<i>Oh, she wants to sit with us.</i>

622
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,116
[gasps]
Everything is beautiful!

623
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:49,225
There's not enough room
for Bree and Grace.

624
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,022
Oh! Let's go sit over there.

625
00:23:51,157 --> 00:23:52,996
I was gonna go save seats
for my friends.

626
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:54,526
But thanks anyway.

627
00:23:54,661 --> 00:23:56,592
Oh. Uh... Yeah. Okay.

628
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:57,661
No worries.

629
00:23:57,796 --> 00:23:59,564
See? Was that so hard?

630
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,667
No. You're totally right.

631
00:24:00,803 --> 00:24:01,965
That decision's
not gonna haunt us

632
00:24:02,101 --> 00:24:03,867
for the rest
of our lives at all.

633
00:24:04,002 --> 00:24:06,175
- [Bree] No way!
- Bree and Grace!

634
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:07,736
- There you are.
- Riley.

635
00:24:07,871 --> 00:24:10,643
Time to celebrate!

636
00:24:10,778 --> 00:24:12,943
- Say, "awooga"!
- [both] Awooga!

637
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:15,585
Okay, ladies.
Let's all settle in.

638
00:24:17,046 --> 00:24:18,882
[babbling, chuckling]

639
00:24:19,018 --> 00:24:20,850
- Uh, Joy?
- Wait, wait, wait.

640
00:24:20,986 --> 00:24:22,016
- [coach] Ladies!

Settle in means settle down.

642
00:24:24,822 --> 00:24:26,092
I need your focus.

643
00:24:26,227 --> 00:24:28,327
Which means now I'm going
to need your cell phones.

644
00:24:28,462 --> 00:24:29,432
All of 'em.

645
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,425
[girl] Wait, what?
Are you serious?

646
00:24:31,561 --> 00:24:35,929
[tuts] You're here
to work, not goof around.

647
00:24:36,065 --> 00:24:37,299
Got that, Andersen?

648
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:39,939
Yes, Coach.

649
00:24:40,074 --> 00:24:42,072
Please put all your phones
in the basket.

650
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:44,207
You get them back
at the end of camp.

651
00:24:46,175 --> 00:24:49,279
Wow. Coach is so serious.

652
00:24:49,414 --> 00:24:51,747
Joy, I'm just curious.
Maybe, um, I could help...

653
00:24:51,883 --> 00:24:52,814
Thank you. Not now.

654
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,287
I know, right? [laughs]

[all chuckling]

656
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,155
Oh. [chuckles]
You think this is funny?

657
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,227
Uh-huh. Well, you know
what else is funny?

658
00:25:00,363 --> 00:25:01,455
Skating lines.

659
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,994
- Now hit the ice, ladies.
- [all groaning]

660
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,026
- Great job, Michigan.
- Thanks a lot, new girl.

661
00:25:05,162 --> 00:25:06,901
[girl 1] Just make her do it.

662
00:25:07,037 --> 00:25:10,207
[sighs] Bravo, Joy.
She's totally fitting in now.

663
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,404
Oh, thanks so much, Wee-Wee.

[all panting]

665
00:25:16,142 --> 00:25:17,878
You're lagging behind, Andersen!

666
00:25:18,013 --> 00:25:19,873
- Skate harder!
- [player] This is the worst.

667

[whistle blows]

668
00:25:21,114 --> 00:25:23,143
All right, ladies,
take a breather.

669
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,314
Then we'll divide into teams.

670
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:28,119
[breathing heavily]

671

[Fire Hawk player]
Oh, that Michigan girl

672
00:25:32,622 --> 00:25:34,725
- is off to a rough start.
- [Anxiety] <i>Oh, no.</i>

673
00:25:34,861 --> 00:25:36,094
Are they talking about us?

674
00:25:36,229 --> 00:25:37,830
Yeah, there's no way
Coach is putting her

675
00:25:37,966 --> 00:25:39,295
on the team if she can't
get it together.

676
00:25:39,431 --> 00:25:41,666
Uh, okay, Dani,
like you had it all together

677
00:25:41,802 --> 00:25:42,798
when you were a freshman?

678
00:25:42,934 --> 00:25:44,336
I wasn't that immature.

679
00:25:44,472 --> 00:25:48,903
[Sofia] Dani, you stuck straws
up your nose. Like last night.

- [sobbing]
- [Envy] Oh.

684
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,752
I always wanted people to talk
about us, but not like this.

685
00:26:00,887 --> 00:26:03,091
Oh, Joy, what do we do now?

686
00:26:03,226 --> 00:26:03,951
Um...

687
00:26:04,086 --> 00:26:05,391
We can just, um...

688
00:26:05,526 --> 00:26:06,655
I have an idea.

689
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,128
Okay.

690
00:26:08,264 --> 00:26:11,668
If we can get Val on our side,
everything will be great.

691
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,899
Uh, Val?

692
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:18,701
Oh, hey, Riley. What's up?

693
00:26:18,836 --> 00:26:20,138
Uh, I-I...

00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:23,109
I'm so sorry.

695
00:26:23,245 --> 00:26:25,345
I didn't mean to get
the whole team skating lines.

696
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,513
I feel terrible.

697
00:26:26,648 --> 00:26:27,783
I respect you so much.

698
00:26:27,918 --> 00:26:29,215
I would never do anything
to mess you up.

699
00:26:29,351 --> 00:26:30,786
Uh, that's laying it on
a bit thick, don't you think?

- [shushes] Joy.
- <i>You're a great hockey player,</i>

701
00:26:32,053 --> 00:26:33,380
and you lead the team
so amazingly,

702
00:26:33,516 --> 00:26:34,720
and I really
look up to you and...

703
00:26:34,856 --> 00:26:36,550
Okay, okay. Thanks. [chuckles]

704
00:26:36,686 --> 00:26:39,461
Listen, Coach was pretty hard
on you today,

705
00:26:39,596 --> 00:26:40,957
but that's not a bad thing.

706
00:26:41,093 --> 00:26:42,525
It means you're on her radar.

707
00:26:42,661 --> 00:26:43,766
Really?

708
00:26:43,901 --> 00:26:45,362
Listen, I'm glad you came
to talk with me.

709
00:26:45,498 --> 00:26:47,631
Hey, let's try to be on
the same team later, okay?

710
00:26:47,766 --> 00:26:49,096
Oh, yeah. Cool.

711
00:26:49,231 --> 00:26:50,300
- [sighs wearily]
- Wow.

712
00:26:50,435 --> 00:26:52,005
- [Ennui] Good job. Wow.
- I wish I could do that.

713
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:54,441
You guys, I mean,
it really wasn't anything.

714
00:26:54,577 --> 00:26:56,143
I'm just trying to help.

715
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,576
I agree.

716
00:26:57,712 --> 00:26:59,779
Great job, Anxiety.

717
00:26:59,914 --> 00:27:01,677
I stepped back, you stepped in,

718
00:27:01,812 --> 00:27:04,720
you got Riley back on track,
now I'm ready to step back in.

719
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:06,519
But that was just
part one of my plan.

720
00:27:06,655 --> 00:27:07,821
There's a part two?

721
00:27:07,957 --> 00:27:10,320
A good plan has many parts, Joy.

722
00:27:10,455 --> 00:27:12,394
Okay, ladies,
we're gonna form your teams

723
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:13,553
for the rest of camp.

724
00:27:13,689 --> 00:27:14,830
Now, split yourselves
down the middle.

725
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,958
Team one on the right,
team two on the left.

726
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,030
Let's do this!

727
00:27:19,165 --> 00:27:20,597
One more time
on the same team, right?

728
00:27:20,732 --> 00:27:21,738
Right.

729
00:27:23,704 --> 00:27:24,903
Val wants us.

730
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:26,676
But we promised Bree and Grace.

731
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,646
Joy, we have to
plan for the future.

732
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:33,046
Come on, Riley, move.
Move those feet!

733
00:27:33,182 --> 00:27:34,513
Val's on team one,
you wanna be on team one.

734
00:27:34,648 --> 00:27:35,618
Let's go.

735
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,386
She made a promise
to her friends.

736
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:39,047
She's not gonna break it.

737
00:27:39,183 --> 00:27:41,017

00:27:44,487 --> 00:27:47,225
No! You can't have that.
Put that back.

741
00:27:50,098 --> 00:27:51,029
Joy, I don't mean to overstep...

742
00:27:51,164 --> 00:27:52,092
- No!
- ...but it has to be done.

743
00:27:52,228 --> 00:27:54,034
What are you... No!

744
00:28:02,446 --> 00:28:04,008
[gasps] No...

but watch.

- I'm so excited.
- [gasps]

747
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:14,483
All right.
Welcome to our team, Michigan.

748
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:22,531
That is not Riley.

749
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:23,997
I know. It's a better Riley.

750
00:28:24,132 --> 00:28:26,295
A Riley who won't be alone
next year.

751
00:28:26,431 --> 00:28:28,633
We build her
a new Sense of Self.

752
00:28:28,768 --> 00:28:30,631
A brand-new her.

753
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:32,201
No, no, no!

754
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,508
You can't go down there
with that.

I am truly sorry.

I was so looking forward
to working with you guys.

Hey, hey! What do you think
you're doing?

Get off me!

760
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,747
Riley's life
is more complex now.

761
00:28:45,883 --> 00:28:48,285
It requires more sophisticated
emotions than all of you.

762
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,851
You just aren't what
she needs anymore, Joy.

It's just
until Riley makes varsity,

or until she turns 18,
or maybe forever.

I don't know.
We'll have to see.

Don't worry, Riley.
You're in good hands.

Quick question. How do we
build a new Riley,

00:29:27,626 --> 00:29:29,865
which I'm loving, by the way,
amazing concept,

783
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:33,233
if it took them 13 years
to build the old one?

784
00:29:33,369 --> 00:29:35,597
Well, good news is we're not
starting from scratch.

785
00:29:36,771 --> 00:29:37,837
I wanna plant one.

[Anger] <i>And then I punt her
into the dump.</i>

962
00:35:58,081 --> 00:35:59,084
- [Anxiety screaming]
- What? No, Anger.

963
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,323
Okay, fine. No punting.

964
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,491
Don't worry, I know
right where the stream is.

965
00:36:04,626 --> 00:36:07,128
Sadness and I
have been here before. Oh.

966
00:36:07,263 --> 00:36:09,131
[Disgust]
Joy, this is a dead end.

967
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,761
Those are the worst kinds
of ends!

968
00:36:11,897 --> 00:36:15,396
Everything's changing so fast!
[crying]

969
00:36:15,531 --> 00:36:16,668
So, we're lost.

970
00:36:16,804 --> 00:36:19,105
No. You're never lost
if you're having fun.

971
00:36:19,241 --> 00:36:20,536
No one is having fun, Joy.

972
00:36:20,672 --> 00:36:22,174
Oh, come on! Look at Sadness.

973
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,743
She's having a great time.

974
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:25,138
[crying]

975
00:36:25,273 --> 00:36:26,781
I thought you knew
where you were going.

976
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:27,976
I do. I did.

977
00:36:28,111 --> 00:36:29,686
- I just need a moment.
- She doesn't know.

978
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:31,254
We're stuck here!

979
00:36:32,021 --> 00:36:33,654
Oh, Riley's awake.

980
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,124
Wait, she's up too early.
What are they doing to her?

981
00:36:36,259 --> 00:36:38,261
Come on, we'll find another way.

982
00:36:39,858 --> 00:36:42,155
Don't worry, Riley.
We're coming.

983
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,493
[memories clinking]

984
00:36:45,629 --> 00:36:46,764
[breathing heavily]

985
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:48,903
[Ennui sighs]

986
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:51,132
Why are we up so early?

987
00:36:51,267 --> 00:36:53,671
Because, <i>mon ami,</i>
we need to speed things up,

988
00:36:53,806 --> 00:36:55,137
and that means
we hit the ice early,

989
00:36:55,273 --> 00:36:57,841
<i>and practice like
we've never practiced before.</i>

990
00:36:57,976 --> 00:36:59,574
[Ennui] <i>Aren't we already good
at hockey?</i>

991
00:36:59,709 --> 00:37:00,844
[Envy] <i>We're good.</i>

992
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,352
- But the Fire Hawks are great.
- That's right!

993
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:06,881
[grunts, groans]

994
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:08,048
[Anxiety]
<i>Every time we miss,</i>

995
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,225
<i>we skate a lap around the rink.</i>

996
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,452
Hockey is not a game,
it is a sport.

997
00:37:11,588 --> 00:37:13,329
[Riley grunts]

998
00:37:21,299 --> 00:37:22,730
[grunts]

999
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,565
- Yes!
- [Envy] <i>Wow.</i>

1000
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,833
That was amazing.

1001
00:37:25,969 --> 00:37:27,909
We need to be that good
every time.

1002
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:29,403
Let's run it again.

1003
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,179
Hey, I see I'm not the only
one who likes to start early.

1004
00:37:31,314 --> 00:37:32,508
[Anxiety] <i>You guys, it's Val!</i>

1005
00:37:32,643 --> 00:37:33,775
We had the same idea.

1006
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,149
We're basically the same person.

1007
00:37:35,284 --> 00:37:36,678
We're gonna be best friends.

1008
00:37:36,813 --> 00:37:38,119
How long have you been here?

1009
00:37:38,254 --> 00:37:40,080
I don't know. Maybe an hour.

1010
00:37:40,215 --> 00:37:42,649
I just wanted to get in
some extra ice time.

1011
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,787
I'm the same way.

1012
00:37:43,922 --> 00:37:45,395
[Anxiety]
<i>Oh, my gosh. She gets us.</i>

1013
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,791
See? I told the other girls
you'd figure it out.

1014
00:37:47,927 --> 00:37:50,190
You get what it takes
to be the best.

1015
00:37:52,496 --> 00:37:53,561
Look at us.

1016
00:37:53,697 --> 00:37:55,272
This is going great!

1017
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:57,934
Yeah! But we need Val
to really like us.

1018
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:00,067
Oh, we should ask Val
lots of questions.

1019
00:38:00,203 --> 00:38:01,774
People love
talking about themselves.

1020
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:05,071
So, what was your freshman
year on the Fire Hawks like?

1021
00:38:05,206 --> 00:38:07,873
I mean, it was a lot of work,

1022
00:38:08,009 --> 00:38:09,385
like, a lot... [chuckles]

1023
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,779
but it's also
how I met my best friends.

1024
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,918
Val is sharing things with us!

1025
00:38:14,054 --> 00:38:16,059
Hey, a few of us are just
gonna hang out tonight,

1026
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:18,151
order some food.
You should come.

1027
00:38:18,287 --> 00:38:20,620
Oh! An exclusive invitation.
[chuckles]

1028
00:38:20,755 --> 00:38:21,965
We're going!

1029
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,392
- Really?
- Definitely.

1030
00:38:23,528 --> 00:38:24,598
It'll be fun.

1031
00:38:24,733 --> 00:38:26,534
[coach] All right, ladies,
let's warm up.

1032
00:38:28,004 --> 00:38:29,132
Hey, Riley.

1033
00:38:29,268 --> 00:38:30,206
Hi.

1034
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:32,164
We are not sharing Val
with them.

1035
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,370
[grunts] Early mornings
make me so hungry.

1036
00:38:34,506 --> 00:38:35,742
I know, right?

1037
00:38:35,878 --> 00:38:38,108
I'd give anything for a piece
of pizza right now.

1038
00:38:38,244 --> 00:38:39,015
Yes!

1039
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,984
See? I told you I'd find it.

1040
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,408
The Stream of Consciousness.

1041
00:38:42,543 --> 00:38:45,450
- [Sadness] But, Joy...
- Wow! Our girl is hungry.

1042
00:38:45,585 --> 00:38:46,681
Hop on something delicious!

1043
00:38:46,817 --> 00:38:48,015
- Joy...
- Ooh, deep dish.

1044
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,892
[chuckles]
And it's still warm.

1045
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:51,487
Extra cheese, baby!

1046
00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:52,558
Sadness, come on.

1047
00:38:52,694 --> 00:38:53,988
But I've been trying
to tell you.

1048
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:56,290
We can't take the tube back,
Joy.

1049
00:38:56,425 --> 00:38:59,035
Someone has to be
at the console to recall us.

1050
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,095
She's right. We'd be stranded.

1051
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,696
Yeah. Anxiety would have
thought about that.

1052
00:39:02,832 --> 00:39:04,334
Well, I doubt it. Fine.

1053
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:05,937
Okay. Uh...

1054
00:39:06,072 --> 00:39:08,869
So, someone's gonna have to
crawl up that tube,

1055
00:39:09,004 --> 00:39:10,213
and go back to Headquarters,

1056
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,006
and at the right moment,
bring us back.

1057
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:13,806
Oh, I'll do it.
I'll pound that...

1058
00:39:13,942 --> 00:39:15,177
I don't think so, punty.

1059
00:39:15,313 --> 00:39:16,819
- Okay, here's the thing.
- You were never an option.

1060
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,080
Thank you.

1061
00:39:18,216 --> 00:39:20,351
You want me to crawl through
a tube in this?

1062
00:39:20,487 --> 00:39:21,721
Yeah, not happening.

1063
00:39:24,557 --> 00:39:27,228
[gasps] Oh, no, not me.

1064
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:29,124
Yes! Sadness, you could do it.

1065
00:39:29,259 --> 00:39:31,366
You know the console
better than anybody.

1066
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,629
You've read the manuals
cover to cover.

1067
00:39:33,764 --> 00:39:35,066
I mean, you say that,

1068
00:39:35,202 --> 00:39:38,637
but I know a lot less about
Manual 28, Chapter Seven,

1069
00:39:38,773 --> 00:39:40,437
"How to Recall
Non-Memory Objects"

1070
00:39:40,573 --> 00:39:42,070
than most folks realize.

1071
00:39:42,206 --> 00:39:43,803
You've proven my point
for me, Sadness.

1072
00:39:43,939 --> 00:39:44,974
That sounds like a yes.

1073
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,015
[man on radio]
<i>Where is everybody?</i>

1074
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:47,274
<i>You on break again?</i>

1075
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,318
Ooh! Walkie-talkies. Here.
Check-check-check.

1076
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:50,652
Can you hear me?
I gotta press a button.

1077
00:39:50,787 --> 00:39:53,146
<i>Go for Joy. Copy that. Over.</i>
Oh, I love 'em!

1078
00:39:53,282 --> 00:39:54,620
We'll signal you
when we get there,

1079
00:39:54,756 --> 00:39:56,484
- and then you bring us back.
- Oh...

1080
00:39:56,619 --> 00:39:58,752
[Joy] Sadness, it's the fastest
way back to Headquarters.

1081
00:39:58,888 --> 00:39:59,887
Joy, I can't do it.

1082
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:02,426
I'm not strong like you are.

1083
00:40:02,562 --> 00:40:03,866
I know you, Sadness.

1084
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,424
You are strong.

1085
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,498
I can't give you
specific examples right now,

1086
00:40:08,633 --> 00:40:10,132
but you got this.

1087
00:40:11,234 --> 00:40:12,232
- [Joy grunts]
- [Sadness whimpers]

1088
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:14,209
Just don't look down
and keep moving.

1089
00:40:14,344 --> 00:40:15,935
[Sadness] Yeah, I can do it.

1090
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,744
[crying hysterically]

1091
00:40:19,073 --> 00:40:20,674
She'll be okay. Right?

1092
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:22,545
Uh, fifty-fifty.

1093
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,586
Mmm! You want one?

1094
00:40:25,685 --> 00:40:26,748
But we hate those things.

1095
00:40:26,884 --> 00:40:28,448
They taste like cardboard.

1096
00:40:28,584 --> 00:40:30,884
- [Embarrassment groaning]
- We can't say no to Val.

1097
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,853
Okay, no, you're so right.

1098
00:40:32,989 --> 00:40:34,230
We eat whatever Val eats.

1099
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:35,828
- That's the spirit!
- Whoo!

1100
00:40:35,963 --> 00:40:38,192
Envy, I think you're really
in the zone.

1101
00:40:38,327 --> 00:40:39,625
Take the wheel,
I'll be right back.

1102
00:40:39,761 --> 00:40:41,563
She picked me! She picked me.
Did you see that, Ennui?

1103
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:42,635
She picked me.

1104
00:40:42,771 --> 00:40:44,599
You care too much about things.

1105
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:47,003
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

1106
00:40:47,138 --> 00:40:49,803
It's got
a very interesting texture.

1107
00:40:49,939 --> 00:40:52,205
It tastes like... Mmm...

1108
00:40:52,341 --> 00:40:54,374
What does it remind me of?
Um...

1109
00:40:55,377 --> 00:40:58,850
Cardboard? Asparagus?
Broccoli?

1110
00:40:58,985 --> 00:41:00,653
What are they doing to her
up there?

1111
00:41:00,789 --> 00:41:02,123
I don't know, but we have to go.

1112
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:03,349
No! No way am I step...

1113
00:41:03,485 --> 00:41:06,291
- We have to. Riley needs us.
- [groans]

1114
00:41:06,426 --> 00:41:07,457
Okay, fine!

1115
00:41:07,592 --> 00:41:09,288
Ugh. Ew! Ew!

1116

always trying to
hang out with us?

1272
00:46:28,943 --> 00:46:31,583
Come on, Riley,
we just went to their concert.

1273
00:46:31,718 --> 00:46:32,722
Well, yeah.

1274
00:46:32,857 --> 00:46:34,422
- I mean, sure, but like...
- But what?

1275
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:35,716
We had a great time.

1276
00:46:35,851 --> 00:46:37,382
- Grace, you are not helping.
- [console buzzes]

1277
00:46:37,518 --> 00:46:38,652
[sarcastically] Oh, yeah,

1278
00:46:38,788 --> 00:46:40,530
- we had a great time.
- [Fire Hawks exclaim]

[Riley echoing] <i>Great time.</i>

1280
00:46:43,093 --> 00:46:44,096
[worker clamoring]

1281
00:46:44,231 --> 00:46:45,897
Why can't they just
leave her alone?

1282
00:46:46,033 --> 00:46:47,397
What are we gonna do now, Joy?

1283
00:46:47,532 --> 00:46:49,971
We go the long way,
which is the best way.

1284
00:46:50,106 --> 00:46:52,534
Stretch those hammies, Anger.
Let's go.

1285
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:55,172
Best night of my life.

1286
00:46:55,308 --> 00:46:57,378
Well, this has been really fun.

1287
00:46:57,513 --> 00:46:58,611
Extremely.

1288
00:46:58,747 --> 00:46:59,710
But we're gonna go now.

1289
00:46:59,845 --> 00:47:01,346
Okay, bye.

1290
00:47:01,481 --> 00:47:02,648
- [♪ upbeat pop music playing]
- Oh, this is

1291
00:47:02,784 --> 00:47:03,853
the best band ever!

1292
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:06,086
- Okay, Riley!
- Michigan knows what's up!

1293
00:47:07,419 --> 00:47:09,086
See? As long as
we like what they like,

1294
00:47:09,221 --> 00:47:10,453
we have all the friends we need.

1295
00:47:10,588 --> 00:47:11,859
- [Riley laughing]
- [Sofia] Night, guys.

1296
00:47:11,994 --> 00:47:13,894
Well, I think
I'm calling it a night.

1297
00:47:14,029 --> 00:47:16,030
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, it's late.

1298
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,126
Plus, I think
you'll want to get some sleep

1299
00:47:17,261 --> 00:47:18,399
before tomorrow's scrimmage.

1300
00:47:18,534 --> 00:47:19,894
What scrimmage?

1301
00:47:20,029 --> 00:47:22,069
Uh. It's just something Coach
always does on the last day.

1302
00:47:22,204 --> 00:47:23,900
It's how Val made the team
as a freshman.

1303
00:47:24,036 --> 00:47:25,034
Don't tell her that.

1304
00:47:25,169 --> 00:47:26,742
Val scored two goals.

1305
00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:28,409
No freshman has ever done that.

1306
00:47:28,544 --> 00:47:29,804
Dani, stop.

1307
00:47:29,939 --> 00:47:31,809
Technically, it's not your
tryout for the next year,

1308
00:47:31,945 --> 00:47:33,980
but it basically is.

1309
00:47:34,116 --> 00:47:36,047
You'll do great.
Just be yourself.

1310
00:47:36,182 --> 00:47:37,315
[Anxiety] <i>Did you hear that?</i>

1311
00:47:37,451 --> 00:47:39,386
We could become a Fire Hawk,
like, tomorrow.

1312
00:47:39,521 --> 00:47:42,722
But how do we be ourself if
our new self isn't ready yet?

1313
00:47:42,858 --> 00:47:44,189
[grunts] Excellent point.

1314
00:47:44,324 --> 00:47:46,352
Let's get
these memories downstairs.

1315
00:47:46,487 --> 00:47:47,457
[memories clattering]

1316
00:47:47,892 --> 00:47:49,096
Oh...

1317
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:53,595
[memories clattering]

1318
00:47:57,431 --> 00:47:59,909
Is that broccoli?

1319
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:02,411
We're getting
deeper and deeper in, Joy.

1320
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,545
Great observation.

1321
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:04,737
The long way did turn out

1322
00:48:04,873 --> 00:48:05,847
to be a little longer
than I thought.

1323
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:07,345
Anyway,
who wants to sing a song?

1324
00:48:07,481 --> 00:48:09,684
Oh, I know a song.
It's called, "I give up."

1325
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,586
Or let's play the quiet game!

1326
00:48:11,721 --> 00:48:13,382
One, two, three, hush.

1327
00:48:13,518 --> 00:48:14,814
[Anger] I'll tell you
what we do,

1328
00:48:14,949 --> 00:48:16,253
we go back up there
and we kick those...

1329
00:48:16,389 --> 00:48:17,858
[Joy] Anger,
now is not the time.

1330
00:48:17,993 --> 00:48:19,156
[Disgust] Joy, this is useless.

1331
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:20,862
Real Riley is out there
somewhere,

1332
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:22,062
and we're never
going to find her.

1333
00:48:22,197 --> 00:48:23,262
[worker] You know what?
Yeah, these can go.

1334
00:48:23,397 --> 00:48:24,327
- Forget 'em!
- No, no, no, I can find her.

1335
00:48:24,463 --> 00:48:26,199
I just need to get
a better view.

1336
00:48:28,537 --> 00:48:29,532
[gasps]

1337
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,635
[machine whirring]

1338
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:42,951
Okay, well, this isn't
working, and that's fine.

1339
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:44,380
- Everything's fine.
- This is hopeless.

1340
00:48:44,515 --> 00:48:46,722
I say we cut our losses
and walk back.

1341
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:48,557
This whole trip is just a series

1342
00:48:48,693 --> 00:48:50,024
of deader and deader ends.

1343
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,161
Ever since that
puberty alarm went off

1344
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:54,920
nothing around here works
the way it's supposed to!

1345
00:48:55,055 --> 00:48:57,064
I don't even recognize
this place anymore.

1346
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,265
It's light out at 1:00
in the morning!

1347
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,902
I have never been inside
so many jars in my life.

1348
00:49:03,038 --> 00:49:04,701
And the Riley we knew is gone!

1349
00:49:04,837 --> 00:49:09,341
And if Joy can't see that,
well, then, she's delusional!

1350
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:13,681
Delusional?

1351
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:16,010
Of course I'm delusional!

1352
00:49:16,145 --> 00:49:18,550
Do you know how hard it is to
stay positive all the time,

1353
00:49:18,686 --> 00:49:22,287
when all you folks do is
complain, complain, complain?

1354
00:49:22,422 --> 00:49:24,393
Jiminy mother-loving
toaster strudel!

1355

[all gasp]

1356
00:49:25,523 --> 00:49:27,353
Do you think
I have all the answers?

1357
00:49:27,488 --> 00:49:29,130
Of course I don't!

1358
00:49:29,862 --> 00:49:31,330
[sighs]

1359
00:49:31,466 --> 00:49:34,630
We can't even find
the back of our own mind.

1360
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:40,373
Anxiety is right!

1361
00:49:40,508 --> 00:49:44,409
Riley doesn't need us as much
as she needs them.

1362
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:48,578
And that hurts.

1363
00:49:49,476 --> 00:49:50,679
It really hurts.

1364
00:49:55,521 --> 00:49:57,623
Joy, you've made
a lot of mistakes.

1365
00:49:57,758 --> 00:49:59,227
A lot.

1366
00:49:59,362 --> 00:50:02,328
And you'll make a whole lot
more in the future.

1367
00:50:03,164 --> 00:50:04,693
But if you let that stop you,

1368
00:50:04,828 --> 00:50:07,267
we might as well lie down
and give up now.

1369
00:50:07,403 --> 00:50:09,227
Well, actually,
that does sound kinda nice.

1370
00:50:09,363 --> 00:50:10,369
Ow!

1371
00:50:10,903 --> 00:50:12,206
Come on.

1372
00:50:18,678 --> 00:50:20,345
- [Anger] Excuse us.
- Hey! You can't use that.

1373
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,744
- Riley emergency.
- [Fear] Thank you!

1374
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:24,482
Hop on!

1375
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:28,585

[all grunt]

1379
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:40,562
Let's just forget
that ever happened.

1380
00:50:40,698 --> 00:50:42,128
You don't have to ask me twice.

1381

- [Joy sighs]
- [Disgust groans]

1383

[gasps] Look.

1384
00:50:48,876 --> 00:50:50,277
[Fear gasps]

1385
00:50:51,243 --> 00:50:53,181
We're right behind you.

1386
00:51:00,854 --> 00:51:02,053
[sighs]

1387
00:51:02,188 --> 00:51:03,618
- Whoa!
- This is great.

1388
00:51:03,754 --> 00:51:05,127
The Fire Hawks have accepted us.

1389
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:06,761
But if Coach doesn't put us
on the team,

1390
00:51:06,896 --> 00:51:07,893
none of that matters.

1391
00:51:08,029 --> 00:51:09,428
Tomorrow is everything.

1392
00:51:09,563 --> 00:51:11,725
Which is why
we're gonna need more help.

1393
00:51:11,861 --> 00:51:13,000
Ennui, are you paying attention?

1394
00:51:13,135 --> 00:51:14,895
- No.
- Ugh. Embarrassment?

1395
00:51:15,031 --> 00:51:16,004
[Grace] <i>Well,
this has been really fun.</i>

1396
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,271
[Anxiety distantly]
Embarrassment?

1397
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,703
- [Bree] <i>Extremely.</i>
- [Anxiety] Never mind.

1398
00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:20,806
- [Grace] <i>But we're gonna go.</i>
- [Riley] <i>Okay, bye.</i>

Ah!

1401
00:51:31,485 --> 00:51:32,688
- [gasps]
- [Anxiety] Now, let's see.

1402
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:34,883
What am I looking for?

1403
00:51:35,019 --> 00:51:36,254
Don't you just hate it
when you go to do something,

1404
00:51:36,389 --> 00:51:37,355
and then you get there to do it,

1405
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:38,589
and you forget
what you were gonna do?

1406
00:51:38,724 --> 00:51:40,295
[Envy] We'll need all the help
we can get.

1407
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,054
[Anxiety] That is exactly
what I was thinking.

1408
00:51:42,765 --> 00:51:43,759
[whimpers]

1409
00:51:49,265 --> 00:51:50,271
Oh...

00:51:53,641 --> 00:51:55,573
[Anxiety] Most important game
of our lives.

[Embarrassment whimpers]

1412
00:52:06,148 --> 00:52:08,288
All right, guys,
it's gonna be a long night.

1413
00:52:08,423 --> 00:52:10,826
- [cans popping open]
- [gulps, sighs]

1414
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,722
So let's get the team ready.

1415
00:52:14,255 --> 00:52:16,457
[Joy] Come on. We just need to
cut through...

1416
00:52:16,593 --> 00:52:18,759
[gasps] Imagination Land!

1417
00:52:18,894 --> 00:52:20,269
Oh, you guys are gonna love it.

1418
00:52:20,404 --> 00:52:23,700
There's French Fry forest
and Cloud Town and...

1419
00:52:24,806 --> 00:52:25,740
Whoa!

1420
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:27,770
This place has changed.

1421
00:52:28,976 --> 00:52:31,211
Mount Crushmore?

1422
00:52:31,347 --> 00:52:32,807
- Those are her top four?
- [Disgust sighs]

1423
00:52:32,942 --> 00:52:35,149
The only one that matters
is Lance.

1424
00:52:35,284 --> 00:52:36,945
Well, at least
they got his good side.

1425
00:52:37,081 --> 00:52:39,613
- Every side is his good side.
- [posters rustling]

00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:42,857
Where all of our good gossip
comes from.

1428
00:52:42,992 --> 00:52:44,016
[Vendor] Extra, extra!

1429
00:52:44,152 --> 00:52:46,128
Pipin' hot rumors
right off the mill!

1430
00:52:46,264 --> 00:52:48,362
"The teacher's lounge
has a hot tub"?

1431
00:52:48,497 --> 00:52:51,131
"Lucy from math class
is legit psychic"?

1432
00:52:51,266 --> 00:52:52,532
"Abbie R's been texting Mike T,

1433
00:52:52,668 --> 00:52:55,069
"but Mike T's been obsessing
over Sarah M"? [gasps]

1434
00:52:55,204 --> 00:52:56,830
Where's the journalistic
integrity?

1435
00:52:56,966 --> 00:52:58,707
Oh!
Fort Pillowton's still here!

1436
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:00,407
And it even got bigger.

1437
00:53:00,908 --> 00:53:01,907
Hmm.

1438
00:53:02,042 --> 00:53:04,180
And orange?

1439
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:09,851
[Anxiety] <i>All right, 22, Riley
breaks her leg in practice,</i>

1440
00:53:09,987 --> 00:53:10,916

1441
00:53:11,052 --> 00:53:12,087
<i>Nice job.</i>

1442
00:53:12,223 --> 00:53:13,746
<i>Now, 18.
Val and Dani whispering</i>

1443

<i>after Riley misses a goal.</i>

1444
00:53:15,182 --> 00:53:17,959
<i>Great! We need to help
Riley prepare.</i>

1445
00:53:18,095 --> 00:53:19,284
<i>Now's the time to send up</i>

1446

<i>every possible thing
that could go wrong.</i>

1447

<i>We are looking to the future.</i>

1448
00:53:23,829 --> 00:53:25,800
<i>Every possible mistake
she could make.</i>

<i>Come on, 17. I'm not seeing
anything from you.</i>

[Anxiety]
<i>Riley misses an open goal,</i>

1452
00:53:34,973 --> 00:53:35,841
<i>Coach writes about it
in her notebook.</i>

1453
00:53:35,977 --> 00:53:36,910
<i>Yes!</i>

1454
00:53:37,045 --> 00:53:38,538
<i>More like that.</i>

1455
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:39,709
[Disgust] Oh, no!

1456
00:53:39,845 --> 00:53:41,679
They're using Riley's
imagination against her.

1457
00:53:41,814 --> 00:53:43,108
<i>Val and her friends like us now,</i>

1458
00:53:43,244 --> 00:53:44,184
<i>but if we don't make the team,</i>

1459
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,751

[sighs]

1461
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:50,523
Okay, let's go to number three.

1462
00:53:50,659 --> 00:53:51,918
- [both cheering]
- Bree and Grace's team win,

1463
00:53:52,053 --> 00:53:53,627
- and we look stupid.
- [groans]

1464
00:53:53,762 --> 00:53:57,090
Number 22. Val passes to us,
and we miss it. [gasps]

1465
00:53:58,269 --> 00:53:59,868
We can't let her
do this to Riley.

1466
00:54:00,004 --> 00:54:02,236
We have to shut this down.

1467
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:04,098
- [worker groans]
- [Anxiety] <i>Love it, 37.</i>

1468
00:54:04,233 --> 00:54:07,441
<i>Riley hits the puck
into her own net.</i>

1469
00:54:07,576 --> 00:54:10,002
- Why are you drawing a hippo?
- I'm not.

1470
00:54:10,137 --> 00:54:11,243
I... [stammers]
I'm drawing Riley!

1471
00:54:11,379 --> 00:54:12,805
Joy, you forgot her ponytail.

1472
00:54:12,941 --> 00:54:14,439
Oh, I love her pony tail. Yes!

1473
00:54:15,242 --> 00:54:17,115
Riley scores
and everyone hugs her?

1474
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:18,815
81, that is not helping.

1475
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:20,784
Riley paints her nails
to match her jersey.

1476
00:54:20,919 --> 00:54:23,485
Everybody copies her.
And she is so cool.

1477
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:25,622
Riley wears knee pads.

1478
00:54:25,758 --> 00:54:28,856
We buy flowers
for the losing team!

1479
00:54:28,991 --> 00:54:31,624
What? I can't always be
the rage guy.

1480
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,065
No, no. I liked it.

1481
00:54:33,201 --> 00:54:34,662
Nail polish? Knee pads?

1482
00:54:34,798 --> 00:54:35,895
I'm starting to think you guys

1483
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:37,796
don't understand the assignment.

1484
00:54:37,932 --> 00:54:39,005
- [can clatters]
- What...

1485
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:40,974
[muffled cheering]

1486
00:54:41,109 --> 00:54:42,168
[sighs in relief]

1487
00:54:42,303 --> 00:54:45,103
What? Who sent that
projection to Riley?

1488
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:46,746
- Why would I know that?
- Don't look at me.

1489
00:54:46,882 --> 00:54:47,842
[groans]

1490
00:54:47,978 --> 00:54:49,543
- [keys clacking]
- [console beeping]

1491
00:54:49,678 --> 00:54:50,812
What is going on?

1492
00:54:50,948 --> 00:54:53,113
Who is sending
all this positive...

1493
00:54:54,649 --> 00:54:55,918
<i>Joy.</i>

1494
00:54:56,053 --> 00:54:57,693
- <i>I know you're in there.</i>
- [workers gasping]

1495
00:54:57,828 --> 00:54:59,359
- [worker 1] Is that really her?
- [worker 2] Is she really here?

1496
00:54:59,495 --> 00:55:00,954
[worker 3]
Joy from Headquarters?

1497
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:02,588
The mind police
are on their way.

1498
00:55:02,723 --> 00:55:03,957
[shuts down]

1499
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,427
Well, I think we gave it
our best shot.

1500
00:55:05,563 --> 00:55:07,228
Don't listen to Anxiety.

1501
00:55:07,364 --> 00:55:10,798
She's using these horrible
projections to change Riley.

1502
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:12,767
<i>Joy, I'm doing this for you!</i>

1503
00:55:12,903 --> 00:55:14,775
This is all
so Riley can be happier.

1504
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:19,407
If you wanted her to be happy,
then you'd stop hurting her.

1505
00:55:19,543 --> 00:55:21,207
Who's with me?

1506
00:55:21,342 --> 00:55:23,510
- [worker 4] Uh-uh.
- [workers whimpering]

1507
00:55:23,645 --> 00:55:25,448
Really? Nothing?

1508
00:55:25,584 --> 00:55:26,915
[Anxiety] <i>Sorry, Joy.</i>

1509
00:55:27,051 --> 00:55:29,856
- [screen chimes]
- Yeah! I see you, 87.

1510
00:55:29,991 --> 00:55:31,018
A cat.

1511
00:55:31,154 --> 00:55:33,059
A little off-topic,
but I'll take it.

1512
00:55:33,194 --> 00:55:34,825
Who else? Come on!

1513
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,096
<i>What if Riley is better than Val</i>

1514
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:37,555
<i>and then Val hates her?</i>

1515
00:55:37,691 --> 00:55:41,095
Or what if Riley is better
than Val and Val respects her?

1516
00:55:41,231 --> 00:55:42,870
- [screens chiming]
- [Joy] Yeah! There we go!

1517
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,364
[sighs softly]

1518
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,575
What if Riley is so bad she
has to give up hockey forever?

1519
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:50,638
What if Riley does so well
that the coach cries,

1520
00:55:50,773 --> 00:55:51,974
and the Olympics call,

1521
00:55:52,109 --> 00:55:55,007
and she rallies
a weary nation to victory?

1522
00:55:55,142 --> 00:55:57,314
Uh, Joy,
reality is also a thing.

1523
00:55:57,449 --> 00:55:59,082
[screens chiming]

1524
00:55:59,218 --> 00:56:00,178
No!

1525
00:56:00,314 --> 00:56:03,419
Anxiety has got you all
chained to desks,

1526
00:56:03,555 --> 00:56:04,755
drawing nightmares!

1527
00:56:04,891 --> 00:56:07,491
But you don't have to
take it anymore!

1528
00:56:07,627 --> 00:56:09,665
Pencils down! Projections off!

1529
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,794
Yeah!

1530
00:56:10,929 --> 00:56:12,368
- Enough is enough!
- [worker cheering]

1531
00:56:14,797 --> 00:56:16,464
[gasps] My projections!

1532
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,806
Pillow fight!

1533
00:56:17,942 --> 00:56:19,368
[all laughing]

[all cheering]

1535
00:56:21,043 --> 00:56:22,334
For Riley!

1536
00:56:22,469 --> 00:56:24,578
- <i>We need to be prepared.</i>
- [screen shatters]

1537
00:56:27,785 --> 00:56:29,341
Oh! No!

1538
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:31,811
[sighs in relief]

1539
00:56:31,946 --> 00:56:33,922
Okay, it's time to go!

1540
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,182
Yeah, I think so.

1541
00:56:35,318 --> 00:56:37,525
- Bring it on, coppers!
- [Joy] Oh, no, no, no.

1542
00:56:38,788 --> 00:56:39,787
[cop blows whistle]

1543
00:56:39,923 --> 00:56:41,491
- [worker cheers]
- [cop groans]

1544
00:56:41,627 --> 00:56:42,661
[cop] Hey, get back here!

1545
00:56:42,797 --> 00:56:44,966
Quick! To the Parade
of Future Careers!

1546
00:56:45,102 --> 00:56:46,292
[workers chattering]

1547
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:49,263
Grab a balloon!

1548
00:56:49,398 --> 00:56:50,471
- [Disgust] Oh, a pastry chef!
- [Joy] Underpaid!

1549
00:56:50,606 --> 00:56:52,132
- [Fear] Art teacher!
- [Joy] Underappreciated.

1550
00:56:52,267 --> 00:56:54,740
- Oh, ethnomusicologist!
- I don't understand

1551
00:56:54,875 --> 00:56:56,807
what that is. Oh!
Supreme Court justice!

1552
00:56:56,943 --> 00:56:57,879
- That's the one!
- I trust her judgment.

1553
00:56:58,015 --> 00:56:59,844
Get back here!

1554
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:01,648
- [Disgust] Move!
- [cop] They're getting away!

1555
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,012
[chuckles] Yes! Now Riley can
get some sleep.

1556
00:57:07,148 --> 00:57:09,749
[Fear sobbing]
I miss the jar!

1557
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:11,184
Joy doesn't get it.

1558
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,656
Without our projections,
we won't be prepared.

1559
00:57:13,792 --> 00:57:15,287
Tomorrow's game is everything.

1560
00:57:15,423 --> 00:57:16,957
Coach will either
make us a Fire Hawk

1561
00:57:17,092 --> 00:57:20,127
or doom us
to a friendless future.

1562
00:57:20,262 --> 00:57:23,297
I wish we knew what
Coach thought about us.

1563
00:57:23,432 --> 00:57:27,005
- [gasps] Her notebook!
- Yes! That's a great idea!

1564
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:29,203
[Dani] <i>Everything Coach thinks
about you is in there.</i>

1565
00:57:30,306 --> 00:57:32,074
All we got to do is sneak
into her office

1566
00:57:32,209 --> 00:57:33,647
- and read it.
- [Embarrassment whimpers]

1567
00:57:37,215 --> 00:57:38,751
[Anxiety] <i>Come on, Riley.
Move those feet.</i>

1568
00:57:39,552 --> 00:57:40,718
She doesn't want to?

1569
00:57:40,854 --> 00:57:42,390
Uh, are we pushing her too hard?

1570
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:44,385
We got to see
what's in the notebook!

1571
00:57:44,521 --> 00:57:46,627
It's the only way for us
to know how we can do better.

1572
00:57:54,896 --> 00:57:57,104
Oh, Riley, no.

1573
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,969
[whimpers] Oh. Hmm.

1574
00:57:59,938 --> 00:58:01,870
[whispering]
Joy? Come in, Joy.

1575
00:58:02,006 --> 00:58:02,971
[Joy loudly, over radio]
<i>Sadness?</i>

1576
00:58:03,107 --> 00:58:04,112
[muffled]
<i>Sadness, what's wrong?</i>

1577
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:05,412
Why is Riley awake again?

1578
00:58:05,547 --> 00:58:06,847
- Over.
- [Fear screaming]

1579
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,648
Anxiety is making Riley
break into the coach's office.

1580
00:58:09,784 --> 00:58:11,376
- What?

01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,093
Newsflash, you did!

2063
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:28,985
Wait, you're right, I did.
[chuckles]

2064
01:24:29,121 --> 01:24:31,523
I'm jealous of myself.
Thanks for the reminder.

[male voice] You're welcome!

2066
01:24:32,928 --> 01:24:35,130
- Who said that?
- It's my new buddy, Pouchy.

2067
01:24:35,266 --> 01:24:37,100
Hi, everybody. I'm Pouchy!

2068
01:24:37,236 --> 01:24:38,896
Confetti if we make the team!

2069
01:24:39,031 --> 01:24:40,570
- Good idea. Ah!
- [party horn blows]

2070
01:24:40,705 --> 01:24:43,138
That's great, but either way,
we love our girl.

2071
01:24:43,273 --> 01:24:44,670
Confetti if we don't!

Oh, is it Coach's email?

2075
01:24:49,215 --> 01:24:51,651
No. It's Bree and Grace.
[chuckles]

2076
01:24:51,787 --> 01:24:54,086
Aw. I miss those girls.

2077
01:24:54,222 --> 01:24:56,749
Oh. Remember when
Bree and Grace,

2078
01:24:56,885 --> 01:24:58,156
- and us used to...
- You're still early.

2079
01:24:58,292 --> 01:24:59,784
- No, no, no. Too early.
- Go downstairs.

2080
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,522
I'll just be downstairs
if you need me.

[Joy] <i>It's 3 minutes to 2:00.</i>

2082
01:25:04,156 --> 01:25:06,465
- She's got this.
- 'Cause she's got us.

2083
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:12,134
Ooh, yeah! Right? 'Cause
she's... [nervously] Maybe?

2084
01:25:12,270 --> 01:25:13,864
All right, Embarrassment.

Everybody,
look at Embarrassment!

[whimpers]

2087

Hey, look, if you don't
make it this year,

2088
01:25:20,113 --> 01:25:21,381
there's always next year.

2089
01:25:21,517 --> 01:25:22,808
I know.

2090
01:25:22,944 --> 01:25:25,378
- I love our girl.
- How could you not?

2091

[Sadness] <i>And great at hockey.</i>

2093

[Disgust]
<i>She's really creative.</i>

2094
01:25:30,016 --> 01:25:32,282
She can be bored,
but never boring.

2095
01:25:32,417 --> 01:25:35,118
But she can be a little
sarcastic from time to time.

2096

[Fear] <i>She can have

do the wrong thing.</i>

2098

[Joy] <i>And sometimes, she can be
too hard on herself.</i>

So, Riley, how was camp?

2106
01:26:27,747 --> 01:26:30,616
Okay, we talked about this.
We tell them everything.

2107
01:26:30,751 --> 01:26:31,916
Uh...

2108
01:26:32,052 --> 01:26:33,243
But what about sneaking

2109
01:26:33,378 --> 01:26:34,351
- into Coach's office?
- What about hitting Grace?

2110
01:26:34,487 --> 01:26:35,251
- Remember the lying?
- Are we gonna

2111
01:26:35,387 --> 01:26:36,420
tell her about the Fire Hawks?

2112
01:26:36,556 --> 01:26:37,956
- She doesn't need to know.
- Objection.

It was good.

She goes away for three days

And what about
the red in her hair?

2118
01:26:48,167 --> 01:26:49,363
Did she join a gang?

2119
01:26:49,498 --> 01:26:51,062
Welcome back, Anxiety.
