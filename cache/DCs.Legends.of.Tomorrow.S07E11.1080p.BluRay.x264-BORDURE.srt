1
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,519
Archduke Ferdinand
is still alive!

2
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:20,313
World War I never happens!

3
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:22,232
That's 20 million lives saved.

4
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:23,650
Drinks are on the house!

5
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:26,444
Couple of stout?

6
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:28,506
- No, thank you.
- Oh, no, no, I'm too nervous to drink.

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,656
Nervous?

8
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:32,617
Sara Lance did it.
She changed a Fixed Point.

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,952
Yes, but she and our companions

10
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:35,679
are about to go into battle
with an evil <i>Waverider,</i>

11
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,503
and some extremely formidable
time correctors.

12
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:39,207
Not unless we kick their asses first.

13
00:00:39,332 --> 00:00:44,295
I'm not gonna let some fascist time cops
tell me how history should be.

14
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:46,589
Yeah!

15
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:47,799
What have I done?

16
00:00:48,508 --> 00:00:49,968
No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

17
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:51,553
This is our battle, not yours.

18
00:00:51,636 --> 00:00:54,889
Trust me now. This is not an enemy that
you want to be going up against now.

19
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:57,641
Yeah!

20
00:00:58,601 --> 00:00:59,602
No, no, no.

21
00:00:59,978 --> 00:01:02,522
I am terribly sorry, Legends.
I inadvertently ran my mouth,

22
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:05,626
<i>and now all of the bar patrons are
headed your way to assist in the attack.</i>

23
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,569
<i>I sincerely hope
I haven't ruined the offensive.</i>

24
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,946
Gideon, it's all right.
It's not your fault.

25
00:01:10,697 --> 00:01:12,633
We're just going to have to take
the <i>Waverider</i> quickly.

26
00:01:12,657 --> 00:01:13,937
All right, Cap, what's the plan?

27
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:16,117
When the robos exit
to restore the timeline,

28
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,162
we'll ambush and seize the <i>Waverider.</i>

29
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:21,165
So we just take Evil Gideon offline,
and the <i>Waverider's</i> ours.

30
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:24,252
Goodbye, robots.
Goodbye, janky time travel.

31
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:28,256
I wonder who they're copies of.
I hope it's not an army of Hoovers.

32
00:01:28,423 --> 00:01:30,192
Robos are robos.
Doesn't matter what they look like.

33
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:31,217
We're taking them down.

34
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:35,096
Damn right, Astra.
There's no one the Legends can't beat.

35
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:52,238
Son of a...

36
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:58,953
That's who Evil Gideon sent to kill us?

37
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:01,331
We really are our own worst enemy.

38
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:03,294
All right, we're wasting time.
Should we attack?

39
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,728
No, they could use
the <i>Waverider</i> as cover.

40
00:02:05,752 --> 00:02:07,629
We need to find something
to draw them away.

41
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:15,509
It's a trap.

42
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:18,306
Ms. Cruz and Mr. Green, stay on the ship
and help locate the Legends.

43
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:20,808
The rest of you,
eliminate every time traveler

44
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:22,852
and restore the timeline.

45
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,192
What the...

46
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:36,031
- No!
- Damn it.

47
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:48,502
No.

48
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:50,421
Robo me is steel with normal skin.

49
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:52,090
And he has giant arms?

50
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:54,842
I mean, come on, pick one.
The ego on me.

51
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,886
I mean, he's clearly overcompensating.

52
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:00,014
Oh, no, no,
he's really filling out those pants.

53
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:05,687
You heard Gideon.

54
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,106
Let's kill these time-traveling losers.

55
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,400
Steel punch!

56
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:13,486
Oh, my God!

57
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:30,878
I'm a monster.

58
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,507
- Wait.
- Behrad!

59
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,053
Stop killing people!

60
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:44,559
Gideon, we found 'em.

61
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:48,396
All right, let's draw them away.

62
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:50,690
Come on, go! Run! Go!

63
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:57,280
- Babe, come on.
- No, I'm fine.

64
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:58,948
- No, seriously, I'm fine.
- Okay.

65
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:01,826
Ow!

66
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,150
We need to get her out of here.

67
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:09,542
Get Ava to the Fixed Point.
Nate and I will buy you some time. Go!

68
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,918
It's okay. Let's go.

69
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:12,086
This way.

70
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:19,361
<i>Halt your pursuit.</i>

71
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:22,889
Aw, come on, Gideon. I can't wait
to kill the puny-armed version of me.

72
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:24,372
Believe it or not, Captain Heywood,

73
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:26,112
but the Legends
are merely distracting you.

74
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:29,812
The epicenter of this Aberration is
Archduke Ferdinand, who is still alive.

75
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,535
Did they stop following us?

76
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:47,389
That doesn't make sense.
What's more important than stopping us?

77
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:49,248
Well, we did delay
the start of World War I,

78
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:51,101
but you said Thawne was gonna
take care of that, right?

79
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,418
Yeah, but they don't know that,

80
00:04:52,502 --> 00:04:54,337
and they've been
targeting time travelers.

81
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:58,800
I have to warn Thawne.
I'll meet you at The Fixed Point.

82
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:04,972
In a moment,
the archduke and his wife will pass by.

83
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:07,600
Princip, you must do

84
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,811
what the other members
of the Black Hand could not.

85
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,039
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You can't be here.

86
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,755
He's got a weapon!

87
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:27,787
Oh, my God!

88
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:03,322
World War I is back on track.

89
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:05,575
I hope you did what you needed to do.

90
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,035
I haven't seen that outfit in ages.

91
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:17,795
At least her outfit
doesn't have a hole in it.

92
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:25,511
I'm okay, I'm okay.

93
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:26,780
Come on, sit down over here.

94
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,364
Let's take this coat off, now shall we?

95
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,650
Like shooting fish in a barrel.

96
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:02,757
Thawne.

97
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:07,219
Hey. All right, I'm going to get help.
You just hold on.

98
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:08,888
It's too late.

99
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,473
Thawne, I'm sorry.

100
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:13,184
It is...

101
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:18,481
It is yours now.

102
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:21,400
Hey, hey.

103
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:08,613
How's Ava?

104
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,158
Oh, Miss Lance. Yes, uh, well,

105
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:11,841
I used some vodka
to disinfect the wound,

106
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,996
and then she ingested even more
to numb her pain.

107
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:17,094
But by the grace of God,
she will be fine.

108
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:21,877
Okay, so...

109
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,547
here's the situation.

110
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,882
Our stealth plan has gone to hell.

111
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,885
The <i>Waverider's</i> in the air,
the Robo-Legends are after us,

112
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:32,304
and the time travelers
are all gone or dead.

113
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,516
Thawne is dead as well.

114
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:37,059
Poor <i>chica.</i>

115
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:38,644
What about the timeline?

116
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:42,732
Let's just focus
on the immediate problem.

117
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:43,899
The robos.

118
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:48,154
Now, unless someone has a better idea,
here's my crazy one.

119
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:49,572
I want to talk to them.

120
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:53,075
You want to talk to them?

121
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:56,495
Look, they want to protect the timeline,
we want to go home.

122
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:58,080
We both want the same thing.

123
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:03,085
So if I can just explain it to them
in terms they can understand...

124
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,964
I think it's a risk worth taking,
and I'd like to be here to assist.

125
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,008
You're waiting in the manor.

126
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:12,011
Look, I appreciate that, Gideon,

127
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:16,140
but you all need to wait in the manor,
in case this plan goes south.

128
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:23,439
Hey, babe. Are you feeling okay?

129
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:25,941
Just, uh...

130
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,611
- Just promise you'll be careful.
- I will.

131
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:31,155
Get some rest, okay?

132
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,962
<i>Robo-Legends, this is Sara Lance.</i>

133
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:50,257
How did you losers access our comms?

134
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:51,383
<i>I, uh...</i>

135
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:53,844
tried a bunch of different channels.

136
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,639
You've given up. Smart.

137
00:09:57,556 --> 00:10:00,476
No, actually, I want to talk.
No fighting.

138
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:03,479
Meet me at the tavern
where they plotted to kill the archduke.

139
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,942
"No fighting."

140
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,069
They're pathetic.

141
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,594
I can't let you do this alone.

142
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,018
At a parley you must have a second.

143
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:21,580
- Look, we already had this conversation.
- But I insist.

144
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:24,333
You see, soldiers don't
go on missions by themselves.

145
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,894
They stick together.
It's part of the disciplines

146
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:27,169
and the rules of war.

147
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:29,296
Your rules have gone
out of the window, all right?

148
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:32,007
I need you to get back
to the manor, please.

149
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,431
Just go!

150
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:41,392
Out, peasants!

151
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:51,527
- Where's your captain?
- Hmm.

152
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,321
I'm the captain, flesh bag.

153
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,615
That's a choice.

154
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:57,950
Hmm.

155
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,119
Look, all this violence,
it's unnecessary.

156
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:03,747
We both want the same thing,
to protect the timeline.

157
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,084
Is that why you saved the archduke?

158
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:10,171
That was to lure the <i>Waverider.</i>
We had a plan to put history back,

159
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:12,548
which is why
you shouldn't have killed Thawne.

160
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,800
Our orders were
to kill all time travelers here,

161
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,135
including you.

162
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:18,637
We don't even want to be here.
We want to go home.

163
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:21,682
So let's just come to an agreement
so no one else has to die.

164
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,267
You Legends are the worst.

165
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:24,828
Well, you were modeled after us.

166
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,645
We're nothing like you!

167
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,690
You guys are pathetic losers
who ruin everything.

168
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:33,110
Were you programmed to be this annoying
or is that a personal choice?

169
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:37,281
We have one job,
and that's to protect the timeline,

170
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,534
and kill anyone who messes with it,
so I guess we have two jobs.

171
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:46,165
That's why we have to kill you,
you team, and your wife...

172
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,709
right here, right now.

173
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,044
Well.

174
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:54,340
Then I guess there will be fighting.

175
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:56,425
But I have to warn you,
I'm not that easy to kill.

176
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:59,261
Oh, because of your invincibility?
Hmm...

177
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:00,888
You know, I'm going to torture you.

178
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,225
I am gonna kill you
over and over and over again,

179
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:05,868
until you give me your team's location.

180
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:08,562
Bye.

181
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,856
Oh!

182
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:12,922
Nice try.

183
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:14,777
Why am I talking like this?

184
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,529
Whatever. It sounds wonderful.

185
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:19,073
Here we go.

186
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,754
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

187
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,172
Calm down. Calm down.

188
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:37,299
Calm down. You just need to
focus on your breathing.

189
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:39,134
Okay, okay, okay.

190
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:40,886
Gwyn, it's okay.

191
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:44,932
It's gonna be okay.

192
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,664
How am I going to kill you next?

193
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:54,942
Decapitation, that'd be fantastic,
to be able to rip off your head.

194
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:56,443
Hmm...

195
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,533
Gideon.

196
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:04,618
Hang on.

197
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:11,125
Gideon, she got away.

198
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,712
These Legends are like cockroaches.

199
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:18,966
But don't worry, I'm the exterminator.

200
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:24,847
What are we gonna do?

201
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:28,642
We can't reason with them,
we can't fight with them.

202
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:30,436
What am I going to tell the others?

203
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:33,731
That you tried to negotiate with them,
and that they tried to kill you,

204
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,959
that you fought honorably
and they fought dishonorably,

205
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:38,610
and therefore you are under
no obligation to fight with honor.

206
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:41,697
Honorably or dishonorably,
we still can't beat them.

207
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,034
In war, a soldier is only ever as good
as his general.

208
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:47,328
Even in the darkest of times,

209
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,913
it is the general's job
to be a beacon of light.

210
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,915
We are the Legends, not the military.

211
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,460
But it's all the same. Don't you see it?

212
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:59,173
I was a lost, lonely, and broken man,

213
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:04,470
but with your help,
I was able to build myself back up.

214
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:09,099
We are in the valley
of the shadow of death...

215
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,187
but we will get through this,

216
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,939
and we will defeat
those wretched machines.

217
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:18,650
I believe in you, Miss Lance...

218
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,028
like you believed in me.

219
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:24,031
And you will figure out
what we are to do here.

220
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:28,660
What would you do?

221
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,746
Who, me?

222
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:32,998
No, no, no, no. I'm no leader.

223
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:34,875
You are.

224
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,879
But you are a soldier with more
wartime experience than any of us.

225
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:43,133
So, against a dishonorable foe
like that, what would you do?

226
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:56,855
It is perilous for us to engage
in any adversary this lethal head-on.

227
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,817
The only way to defeat them
is to never confront them directly,

228
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,528
and to play dirty if we have to.

229
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:06,240
Fighting dirty is up my alley,
but avoiding them like cowards is not.

230
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,659
We must play to
our strengths, Miss Logue.

231
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:11,620
You see, theirs is brawn,
ours is brains.

232
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,581
We cannot out-punch them,
but we will out-think them.

233
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:17,751
Now, our objective
is to infiltrate their base

234
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:19,962
and overthrow their general.

235
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:23,006
Quick question. How are we supposed
to infiltrate the <i>Waverider</i>

236
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,633
if it's both cloaked and flying?

237
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,468
Excellent observation, Dr. Heywood.

238
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:28,971
And in order to circumnavigate this,
your obstacle,

239
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:32,057
we shall deploy a spy.

240
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:37,938
- Huh?
- Excellent.

241
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,565
Oh! Don't forget this.

242
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:40,732
A gun? Great.

243
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:44,445
Now, as soon as you board the <i>Waverider,</i>
you will need to disable Evil Gideon.

244
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:48,449
You see, shutting her down means
that the machines lose their general.

245
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:50,451
And without
Evil Gideon calling the shots,

246
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:51,719
the Robo-Legends should fall apart.

247
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:54,663
From your mouth to God's ears, my boy.

248
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:57,916
- I really got to do this alone?
- Never alone, my boy. Never alone.

249
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,836
You will be accompanied with the team
hidden in the key, mind you.

250
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,296
Because if anybody sees them...

251
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:03,881
- We're screwed.
- Exactly.

252
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:06,300
Now, as soon as Evil Gideon is offline,

253
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,823
you'll need to land the <i>Waverider</i>
so the rest of us can board.

254
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,472
Hey, what do you need us to do?

255
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,682
Well,
as the most experienced fighters,

256
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:17,895
you will distract the machines
by causing a ruckus in Sarajevo.

257
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,731
Ruckus? Can you, uh,
describe this ruckus?

258
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,649
A ruckus that will create
Time Aberrations

259
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,234
for them to deal with, you see.

260
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:26,278
Okay, so by aberrations
you mean like telling them

261
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,640
we put a man on the moon in 1969?

262
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,657
Good God, do we?
What was his crime, I wonder.

263
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,701
- All right.
- Yeah, let's do it.

264
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:34,345
- I don't think I can do this.
- Nonsense.

265
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:35,746
You are more than capable, my boy.

266
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,206
Of pretending to be a psychopath?

267
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:38,540
Now, you listen to me.

268
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,668
Now, I would not have
devised this mission

269
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,253
if I didn't believe in you, my boy.

270
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:47,773
Gideon, I'm gonna need
an immediate evac.

271
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:49,538
They're gonna mine me for parts.

272
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:14,284
Oh.

273
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:15,827
- Hey.
- Hey.

274
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:18,330
You think we're stupid?
We heard everything.

275
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:35,222
You heard... everything?

276
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,518
"Gideon, I need an immediate evac"?

277
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:42,080
I was going to put a bullet
in your sorry head to end your misery.

278
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:45,315
But then I saw you mowed down
those time travelers,

279
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:46,775
and that was pretty cool.

280
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,945
Yeah, I slaughtered
those innocent people.

281
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,990
Their relatives are definitely
mourning them right now.

282
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,491
Oh, I am so jealous.

283
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,869
Now hopefully, Gideon will let us out,
and we can kill Legends.

284
00:17:58,245 --> 00:17:59,931
Or maybe
some will sneak on to the <i>Waverider,</i>

285
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:02,236
and we can shut down the oxygen
and watch them die slowly,

286
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,959
and then Gary can eat them.

287
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:11,425
No, but seriously,
I need to catch up to your kill count.

288
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:13,927
What are you at now?

289
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:16,430
Oh, uh...

290
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:18,849
Can't remember.

291
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,226
"Can't remember"?

292
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:23,832
How many time travelers did you kill?

293
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,149
Six... teen.

294
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:28,775
Sixteen.

295
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,447
Yeah.

296
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,574
Go see Dr. Sharpe and get upgraded.

297
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:37,993
Good idea. I'll do that now.

298
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:54,092
Ah... Oh!

299
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,471
What are you doing here?

300
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:01,391
Just going
to get my upgrade from Dr. Sharpe.

301
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:04,645
- Is she in there?
- Of course not, you idiot.

302
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:07,356
You know I'm the only one
who interfaces with Gideon.

303
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:10,233
Obviously, you tool bag.

304
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:11,860
Need any help?

305
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:14,446
What do you know about computers?

306
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:18,867
Just that they keep track
of my kill count.

307
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,328
Did you see me massacre
those time travelers?

308
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:25,332
It was like...
shooting fish in a barrel.

309
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,043
I'm proud of you.

310
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,132
See you after your upgrade.

311
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:45,811
I am going to need
a year-long cleanse after this.

312
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:47,771
Okay.

313
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:49,773
Ah...

314
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:51,525
They replaced the toilet.

315
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,111
Oh, perfect.

316
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,659
Oh, thank God.
Did you shut down Evil Gidget?

317
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:01,868
Not even close.

318
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:05,205
In fact, the only person
allowed access to her is robo you.

319
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:06,707
There's a robo me?

320
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,670
I'm pretty sure it's impossible to
duplicate this perfect bone structure.

321
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,212
Sure, but you're still going
to have to impersonate her.

322
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,923
Oh! My agents warned me
against playing villains,

323
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,384
but I will make an exception.

324
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,345
What does, um, my robo-self look like?

325
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:22,597
Uh, a '90s hacker.

326
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:25,058
Hmm, very cliché,
but I can work with it.

327
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:30,063
So get this,
not only do I have to play a psychopath,

328
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:33,984
the robos keep telling me I need
to go see Dr. Sharpe and get upgraded.

329
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,068
Just play dumb.

330
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:37,487
It took the Legends years
to realize I was an alien.

331
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:40,699
But even if I do that,
the only blind spot is in the bathroom.

332
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:43,994
How do I convince robo Zari to go there
so we can take her out?

333
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:48,623
Dr. Davies told us to fight dirty,
so maybe you don't convince her.

334
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:51,501
Gideon, that's genius!

335
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:55,130
Do you have a spell or potion
that makes people go to the bathroom?

336
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:56,506
- No.
- I do.

337
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,258
Uh, it's like a...

338
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,677
More of a food poisoning potion,

339
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,804
so I have no idea
what end it will come out of.

340
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:04,728
- Ooh!
- I would love to assist with this ruse.

341
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:07,768
- I can hide in the bathroom or...
- Gideon, stop asking to go out.

342
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:09,954
- But I know the <i>Waverider</i> better.
- Enough!

343
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:12,689
You're not leaving the manor.
Go and help Ava.

344
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:19,571
- Is everything okay?
- It's fine.

345
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:20,781
Okay.

346
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,914
It's all just twos and ones
and ones and twos

347
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:32,667
when it comes to planning your battle
and executing it perfectly

348
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,520
with the disciplines of the war.

349
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:36,505
No, no, no, no.
What are you doing back here?

350
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:37,982
You see, you're supposed to be out there

351
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,716
causing a ruckus
to distract the machines.

352
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,510
Dude, we've been trying.

353
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:43,887
Yeah, I've been doing the Macarena
for an hour out there,

354
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,855
and everyone just looks at me
like I'm crazy.

355
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,572
Yeah. And who knew it would be so hard
to introduce the high five?

356
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:50,811
I don't think this plan is gonna work.

357
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,371
Dr. Heywood, I do believe you are right.

358
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:55,106
You all just seem like
a bunch of raving lunatics to me, man.

359
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:56,817
Damn it!

360
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:00,046
Yes, we are never going to be able
to board the <i>Waverider,</i>

361
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,030
unless we can get the <i>Waverider</i> to land.

362
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,883
And it's not
going to be able to land

363
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:07,786
unless we can draw out
more of those dastardly machines.

364
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,455
Okay, Gwyn,
you are from this time period.

365
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,082
What would you do to cause a ruckus?

366
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,209
I don't know.

367
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,505
I do believe I have an idea.

368
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:27,097
<i>Here's a little song I wrote</i>

369
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,225
Hey, you guys want to see my fish?
Come check it out.

370
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:31,393
Come close. Come see it.

371
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,769
<i>Don't worry</i>

372
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:34,646
Yup.

373
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:37,315
<i>Be happy</i>

374
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,528
<i>Every life we have some trouble</i>

375
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:42,904
Hey.

376
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:44,990
<i>When you worry you make it double</i>

377
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:47,909
- Who's Darth Vader?
- Probably an American thing.

378
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,579
<i>Be happy</i>

379
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:52,914
<i>Don't worry, be happy now</i>

380
00:22:57,836 --> 00:22:59,796
<i>Don't worry</i>

381
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,632
<i>Be happy</i>

382
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,386
<i>Don't worry, be happy</i>

383
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:12,934
<i>Don't worry</i>

384
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:16,271
<i>Be happy</i>

385
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,025
<i>Don't worry, be happy</i>

386
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:21,276
Stand back.

387
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:24,654
<i>Got no place to lay your head</i>

388
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,948
<i>Somebody came
and took your bed</i>

389
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:28,032
<i>Don't worry</i>

390
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:31,620
<i>Be happy</i>

391
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:35,957
Damn. Aberrations are everywhere.

392
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,435
This is the work
of the Legends.

393
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:40,754
Go help Captain Heywood
restore the timeline and eliminate them.

394
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:41,838
Finally.

395
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,759
I bet I can fix more aberrations,
kill more Legends than you.

396
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:47,844
One hour.

397
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:49,930
Loser gets to clean
all the guns in the armory.

398
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:56,770
Yes, that's two more machines
off the <i>Waverider.</i>

399
00:23:57,979 --> 00:23:59,689
It's up to you now, my boy.

400
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:01,066
Copy that.

401
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:07,322
- You need to come with us, Behrad.
- It's time for your upgrade.

402
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,417
You want a power shot before my upgrade?

403
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:28,385
Sure.

404
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:31,930
I suppose I could use a boost.

405
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:39,312
I came up with a killer hack
that makes you feel totally energized.

406
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,564
What makes your hack so killer?

407
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:44,025
My own creatine mix.

408
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:52,409
You're not having one?

409
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,370
I already had, like, three.

410
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:05,046
Hmm.

411
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:08,107
This shot's amazing. I can feel
the creatine coursing through me.

412
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:14,848
Dr. Sharpe, you can take Behrad
to the infirmary by yourself, right?

413
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:19,853
Let's go.

414
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:23,523
Actually...

415
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:27,038
you can strap yourself in
for your upgrade.

416
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:29,262
I'll be with you in a few minutes.

417
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:31,990
Sure, no problem.

418
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,575
Make that ten minutes.

419
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,128
- Astra, are you okay?
- Bathroom.

420
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:53,303
- Dr. Sharpe, what is...
- Bathroom.

421
00:26:00,852 --> 00:26:02,353
No, no, no, no. I was here first.

422
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:04,461
Why don't you just puke in the sink?

423
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:10,653
Showtime!

424
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,491
Gary?

425
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:16,010
What the hell
did you do with the bathroom?

426
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:19,871
Oh...

427
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:24,584
What the hell?

428
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:37,847
Oh. Hello, Gary.

429
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:39,474
Hi, Gideon.

430
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:42,060
- How's Ava?
- Fine. Sleeping it off.

431
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:44,771
Why don't you take a break?
Let Nurse Gary take over.

432
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:46,064
No, no, no.

433
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,441
It's the only thing I can do
without getting yelled at.

434
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,111
Okay.

435
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:57,200
This is amazing.

436
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,283
Mm-hmm.

437
00:26:58,326 --> 00:26:59,386
All right, Gwyn. I'm heading back

438
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,538
to get more future stuff
for Operation Ruckus.

439
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:07,585
Oh! Hey, hey, hey.
Keep those tentacles to yourself.

440
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:10,588
It's me.

441
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:14,551
I'm pretending to be human Spooner
so I can trick those stupid Legends.

442
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:22,183
You bet I am.

443
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:24,078
Yeah, but you've
got to be careful, Gary,

444
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:26,980
because those Legends
are pretending to be us.

445
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:31,234
Yeah.

446
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:32,484
Yeah.

447
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:34,398
What the hell are you doing?

448
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,324
It's me.

449
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:45,748
I have a grenade, you idiot.

450
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,168
Still want to eat me?

451
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,824
Gary, you're supposed to be watching
the portal entrance.

452
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,784
Yeah. Well, there's this thing.

453
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:24,847
I mean, it's not really important,
but it's not not-important.

454
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:25,914
Spit it out.

455
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,790
Why are you being so mean to Gideon?

456
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:29,667
What do you mean?

457
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:31,937
Well, every time she tries
to help out with the mission,

458
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:33,254
you shut her down.

459
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:35,698
It's for her own good.
She's only going to get herself hurt.

460
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:36,841
Get herself hurt?

461
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:38,384
Oh.

462
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,889
Seeing robo Behrad almost shoot her
must have really scared you.

463
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:44,366
I don't know
what you're talking about, Gary.

464
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,559
No, I think I know
why you're acting this way.

465
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:50,355
You know, it's because
you're kind of like her mother.

466
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:52,273
Don't be stupid. I am not her mom!

467
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:57,028
I mean, I did create her.

468
00:28:57,946 --> 00:29:01,074
Seeing her almost get killed,
I don't know what came over me.

469
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:06,120
It's just this rush of emotion,
anger and fear.

470
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:07,830
Aw...

471
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:10,667
That's mama bear Astra coming out.

472
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,085
Shut up.

473
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:40,029
Legends.

474
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:42,699
Has anyone seen Behrad?

475
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:45,034
I want to ask him
if I nailed my robo's look.

476
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:48,037
Ah.

477
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:49,372
Dead ringer.

478
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:53,501
Ow.

479
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:57,338
Ow.

480
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:02,176
Where's Gideon?

481
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:09,976
Guys, help me. I'm the real Zari.

482
00:30:10,351 --> 00:30:12,937
No, no, I'm the real Zari.

483
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:15,690
Huh?

484
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:34,167
Which one's the real Zari?

485
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:47,013
Help me, you idiots.
Don't just stand there.

486
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:48,473
No, help me!

487
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:57,065
- Eat her. Gary!
- Okay.

488
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:58,691
Okay. Which one?

489
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:01,361
This one. No, that one.
Just... No. Uh...

490
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:04,089
Can you not just swallow them both
and spit out the real one?

491
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:05,156
I don't know.

492
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:06,991
Maybe.

493
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:13,623
This is for making me wear cargo pants.

494
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:22,590
Ugh.

495
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:27,053
Were you gonna eat me, Gary?

496
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:29,013
No.

497
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:42,402
Ugh... there's your computer room, Z.

498
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:44,922
We'll manually land the <i>Waverider</i>
once you take out Evil Gideon.

499
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:47,615
The server room is my favorite room.

500
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:49,742
The shutdown code better work.

501
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,994
Computers are so lame.

502
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:55,706
It will. Just insert the drive marked
"override", connect it to the laptop,

503
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,791
then type the code.

504
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:58,418
Okay, see you later, Zari.

505
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:00,002
- Good luck.
- Okay.

506
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:05,216
Okay.

507
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:09,345
All right, all right, all right.
All right. Where are you, override?

508
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:11,263
Okay.

509
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:13,182
Yes.

510
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:15,143
Okay.

511
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,104
Okay, okay. Now, the shut-down code.

512
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:19,814
Okay. Two...

513
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:24,193
Three, six.

514
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:26,404
Delta? Where's the delta key?

515
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:28,507
What are you doing, Miss Tarazi?

516
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:30,116
Uh...

517
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:33,369
I, uh... I want to run a diagnostic,

518
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:39,417
but I need to, uh,
bypass your auxiliary matrix

519
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:42,503
in order to directly interface with it.

520
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:44,547
- Yeah.
- I see.

521
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:47,633
<i>Which other Legends snuck on board
besides you, Miss Tarazi?</i>

522
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:50,428
I don't know...

523
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:53,014
I don't know
what you're talking about, Gideon.

524
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:55,141
I haven't left the ship in ages.

525
00:32:55,391 --> 00:32:56,511
<i>If you don't stop right now,</i>

526
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,478
<i>I will remove
all the oxygen from the ship,</i>

527
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:01,105
<i>killing you
and any other stowaway Legends.</i>

528
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:04,775
You know what, Gidget?
You leave me with no choice.

529
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:08,488
<i>I'm glad you've come to your senses,
Miss Tarazi.</i>

530
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:16,037
Hmm! That wasn't too hard.

531
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:19,832
Behrad, what was that?

532
00:33:22,627 --> 00:33:24,587
Strap in, Z. It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

533
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,427
- Just keep it level!
- Easier said than done.

534
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:35,056
Good.

535
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:37,868
Just circumvent Evil Gideon's operating
system and bring on the thrusters.

536
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:39,244
It would really help
smooth out the landing.

537
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:42,188
About that landing,

538
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:44,855
I could really use those thrusters
right about now!

539
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,110
I almost...

540
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:49,820
got it!

541
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:02,208
I... I can't believe you did it.

542
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:06,254
- You were amazing.
- Impeccable timing.

543
00:34:06,337 --> 00:34:07,505
How is this for timing?

544
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:17,682
Finally.

545
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:20,142
Nice landing, guys.

546
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:22,144
Really thought I was gonna die.

547
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:26,440
Team Ruckus, we got the <i>Waverider.</i>

548
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:28,651
<i>Come onboard!</i>

549
00:34:30,611 --> 00:34:31,821
Yes, yes!

550
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:34,365
I knew you could do it,
I knew you could do it.

551
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:35,950
Congratulations, my boy.

552
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:38,369
Fantastic work, all of you.
Fantastic work.

553
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,081
I love when a plan comes together.

554
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:43,749
Give it up for our general.

555
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:46,294
The man with the plan.

556
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:50,172
- You're now officially a Legend.
- Ah, to the doc.

557
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:52,133
Really? Well, thank you.

558
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:55,553
And there are no other soldiers
that I would rather go into battle with.

559
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:59,056
What he said.

560
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:02,935
Whoo!

561
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,646
Let's go home. I mean, our replica home.

562
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:07,940
- Home adjacent.
- Yes, yes.

563
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:12,320
Wait.

564
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:15,810
- There's something I...
- There are Legends inside.

565
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:20,995
So she and those time turds
gotta be hiding inside here somewhere.

566
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:23,122
Let's find them.

567
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:25,166
Let's kill them.

568
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:28,294
We are so screwed.

569
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:36,802
It's only a matter of time before
they realize the mirror is a portal.

570
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:39,930
I am so profoundly sorry.
You see, this is all my fault.

571
00:35:40,056 --> 00:35:42,016
I thought that if we could
take out their general,

572
00:35:42,058 --> 00:35:44,852
then it would send the rest of those
wretched machines into disarray,

573
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:46,937
but I have profoundly miscalculated.

574
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:51,025
<i>And even with their commander gone,
they seem to still want to kill us,</i>

575
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:53,268
<i>and they're cutting off
our only path to the</i> Waverider.

576
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:56,989
Gwyn, you can't give up hope.
We'll think of something.

577
00:35:57,073 --> 00:35:58,741
But what can we do?

578
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:01,702
Wait, I have an idea.

579
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:06,290
What is that?

580
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:09,460
This is Thawne's
time manipulator.

581
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:16,550
You know his death
is not your fault, right?

582
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:19,095
It doesn't matter
if it's my fault or not.

583
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:20,888
This is now my responsibility.

584
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:24,350
When I asked Thawne
to pause World War I,

585
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:25,601
I gave him my word

586
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:29,480
that if he were to die, that I would
take his place as the fixer.

587
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:30,815
Why didn't you tell me?

588
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:33,359
Because we had more pressing matters...

589
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:38,406
and I guess if I said it out loud,
it would feel more real.

590
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,951
All right.
You're not going at this alone.

591
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:43,160
You've got us.

592
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:45,413
Look, it's too late for that.

593
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:49,291
So... I am going to go out there
and I'm going to distract the robos,

594
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,877
and you guys need to make a run
for the <i>Waverider.</i>

595
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:53,546
No way, <i>jefa.</i>

596
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:55,297
Yeah, we're going home together.

597
00:36:56,006 --> 00:37:00,344
If World War I doesn't happen,
history will change so much

598
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:02,972
that none of us
will have a home to go back to.

599
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:07,143
I have to do this.
I have to protect the Fixed Point.

600
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:10,521
Now, when this hits zero, I'm going to
get sucked into a time loop.

601
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:12,314
And I need you to tell Ava...

602
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:14,567
You tell her to come and find me.

603
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:16,819
- Sara, just...
- Please.

604
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,156
As your captain,
let me protect you guys.

605
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:25,035
One last time.

606
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,464
Well, I see you brought some backup.

607
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:39,133
I get to kill you again.

608
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:46,941
What are you doing?
Go, get to the <i>Waverider.</i>

609
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:49,626
We took that into consideration,
but we're staying together.

610
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:55,191
The more the merrier.

611
00:37:56,358 --> 00:38:00,029
<i>Stand down. The Legends
are no longer a threat to the timeline.</i>

612
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:01,655
<i>Do not harm them.</i>

613
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:03,491
Why aren't they moving?

614
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:06,786
Excellent work.
Your mission is complete.

615
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:08,996
And as a reward,
you'll receive upgrades.

616
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:12,249
But first, you must remove your CPUs.

617
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:21,133
Uh...

618
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:24,595
Team <i>Waverider,</i> something, uh,
pretty weird just happened.

619
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,018
Whoa.

620
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:34,730
Absolutely fascinating
and truly terrifying at the same time.

621
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:37,441
Well, you guys should
probably get going.

622
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:40,110
Oh... No Captain left behind.

623
00:38:40,611 --> 00:38:42,822
- I'm gonna need that bracelet, Sara.
- I appreciate it.

624
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:44,198
Trust me.

625
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:04,528
What happened?

626
00:39:04,552 --> 00:39:06,192
I thought I killed
all you garbage people.

627
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,806
Long story short,
I kicked both of your asses.

628
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:10,891
- No freakin' way.
- Yeah.

629
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:13,686
And as a reward,
I get to guard the Fixed Point

630
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:16,230
of the Archduke Ferdinand's
assassination forever,

631
00:39:16,397 --> 00:39:18,524
something you two time losers
can never do.

632
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:21,861
But we can protect that Fixed Point
way better than you idiots.

633
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:26,115
Hmm... I don't know. I got this special
time bracelet that says otherwise.

634
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:29,076
Ha-ha!

635
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:32,955
Looks like I'm guarding the Fixed Point
now, you beautiful idiot.

636
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:35,207
Huh?

637
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:37,751
Whoa!

638
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:41,922
Fantastic work!

639
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:49,096
Thank you for letting me help.
That was a brilliant plan.

640
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:50,848
It was.
But I'm sure you would've come up

641
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:52,808
with something better
if I'd actually let you.

642
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:55,519
Um...

643
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,606
I'm sorry for sidelining you.

644
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:00,900
- I... I overstepped.
- It's fine, Astra.

645
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:02,484
No, it's not.

646
00:40:03,027 --> 00:40:06,780
And as the person who conjured you
from the wreckage of our old ship,

647
00:40:06,864 --> 00:40:09,158
I just wanted to say that, um...

648
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:15,915
I am really proud of you.

649
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:20,169
Thanks, Mom.

650
00:40:28,594 --> 00:40:31,263
Go on, tell Ava and Gary
it's safe for them to come on the ship.

651
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:32,556
Oh, that's a good idea.

652
00:40:38,938 --> 00:40:43,359
Gary, Ava, come down here.
I have good news.
