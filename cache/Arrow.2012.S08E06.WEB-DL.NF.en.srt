ANY PARTICULAR REASON

00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,303
FOR THIS TRIP
DOWN MEMORY LANE?

YEAH.

HANGING ON
TO SOMETHING.

SOMEONE TOLD ME
JUST RECENTLY THAT,

774
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:53,902
UH...IT'S ABOUT
TIME I MADE
PEACE WITH IT.

NOW YOU UNDERSTAND.

I COULDN'T CHANGE
QUENTIN'S FATE.

I CAN'T CHANGE
MINE EITHER, CAN I?

NO. I'M SORRY.

793
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,663
WHY DID THE MONITOR
GO TO ALL

794
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:31,875
OF THIS TROUBLE
JUST TO...

795
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,459
JUST TO PROVE
A POINT?

796
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,212
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
A MAN WHO NEEDED TO

797
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,338
SEE THINGS FOR HIMSELF.

798
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,425
TELLING YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN ENOUGH.

799
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,427
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
WORKED FOR HIM?

800
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,762
A WHILE.

801
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,223
YOU LIED TO US,

YOU...

803
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,352
YOU LIED TO JOHN.

804
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,854
KEEPING THIS FROM JOHN
HAS BEEN

805
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,355
THE HARDEST THING I'VE
EVER HAD TO DO.

806
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,857
THEN WHY DO IT?

807
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,943
THE SAME REASON YOU LEFT
FELICITY AND MIA

808
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,987
IN THAT CABIN...
TO PROTECT MY FAMILY.

809
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:03,156
DO YOU HONESTLY
BELIEVE THAT WORKING

810
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:06,118
WITH THE MONITOR
IS THE BEST WAY
TO DO THAT?

811
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,744
IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

812
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,371
THE CRISIS IS COMING.
THERE IS NO STOPPING IT.

813
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,498
ALL WE CAN DO IS
TRY TO SURVIVE IT.

814
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,167
OK. HELP ME OUT
HERE, LYLA.

815
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,920
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

816
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:22,050
I KNOW,
BUT YOU WILL...SOON.

817
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:23,760
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU

818
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,428
IS THERE IS AN EVIL COMING
THAT IS GREATER

819
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,847

EVER HAD TO FACE.

I'VE DONE

FROM THE MOMENT
I LEFT THAT CABIN,

825

YOU WERE EXPECTING.

MY CHILDREN?

WHY WOULD THE MONITOR
LET ME SEE QUENTIN

THINK REWARDS
WERE HIS BRAND.
