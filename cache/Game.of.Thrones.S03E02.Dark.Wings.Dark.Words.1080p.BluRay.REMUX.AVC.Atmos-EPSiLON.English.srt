He knew how to dress

this gave him the notion he was fit to be king.

I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...

340
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,464
You can't help because a mother

341
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:39,799
makes one for her children to protect them.

342
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,137
Only a mother can make them.

343
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:51,728
You've made them before?

344
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:56,232
Twice.

345

Did they work?

After a fashion.

347
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:09,037
I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.

348
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:17,670
Many years before that,
one of the boys came down with the pox.

349
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:21,966
Maester Luwin said
if he made it through the night, he'd live.

But it would be a very long night.

351
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:31,518
So I sat with him all through the darkness.

352
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:36,064
Listened to his ragged little breaths.

353
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:38,942
His coughing, his whimpering.

354
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,735
Which boy?

355
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,863
Jon Snow.

356
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:52,205
When my husband brought that baby home
from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him.

357
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,332
I didn't want to see those brown

358
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:56,584
stranger's eyes staring up at me.

359
00:22:57,293 --> 00:23:02,465
So I prayed to the Gods,
take him away. Make him die.

360
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:06,219
He got the pox.

361
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:13,810
And I knew I was
the worst woman who ever lived.

362
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,689
A murderer.

363
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:24,404
I'd condemned this poor,
innocent child to a horrible death

364
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:26,656
all because I was jealous of his mother.

365
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:30,285
A woman he didn't even know.

366
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,496
So I prayed to all seven Gods,

367
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,958
let the boy live.

368
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:41,713
Let him live and I'll love him.

369
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:44,716
I'll be a mother to him.

370
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,595
I'll beg my husband to give him a true name,

371
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:51,222
to call him Stark and be done with it,

372
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:53,016
to make him one of us.

373
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,560
And he lived.

374
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:57,353
And he lived.

375
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:02,358
And I couldn't keep my promise.

376
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,866
And everything that's happened since then,

377
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:14,746
all this horror that's come to my family,

378
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,877
it's all because I couldn't
love a motherless child.

379
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,890
Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?

380
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,644
Yes.

381
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:39,854
You liked him?

382
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,482
I like you, but if you're playing us false,

383
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:44,609
it won't be hard for me to kill you.

384
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:48,279
I've got wildling
blood in my veins. These are my people.

385
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:49,572
I understand.

386
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:52,825
Well, how could you understand?

387
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:54,869
You want to protect your people.

388
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,955
Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans,

389
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:02,794
half of whom want to massacre the other
half for one insult or another?

390
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:06,506
They speak seven
different languages in my army.

391
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:10,510
The Thenns hate the Hornfoots. The
Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans.

392
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:13,346
Everyone hates the cave people.

393
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:18,810
So you know how I got moon
worshippers and cannibals and giants

394
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:21,229
to march together in the same army?

No.

were all going to die if we don't get south.

We should have come
to the Red Fork River by now.

Maybe we passed it.

How could we have passed it?

we can follow it west to Riverrun.

No. I do beg your pardon.

Whenever I wanted to
make a child with him, he...

He had so many excuses,
so many late-night war councils.

He never wanted to try.

Except one evening,

636

after he'd had far too much wine to
drink, he suggested something...

637
00:41:49,091 --> 00:41:51,718
Something that sounded very painful

638
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:54,471
and couldn't possibly result in children.

639
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,433
Maybe the fault was with me.

It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?

It's a new design.
Much easier to load. There's no crank.

- Get up now.

811
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:29,147
Corns. I never used to get corns.

812
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:33,860
I used to ride everywhere,
not march around like a common foot soldier

813
00:52:33,943 --> 00:52:36,279
wearing the same shit boots for over a year.

814
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:38,865
This heel is ruined. There's no way...

815
00:52:38,948 --> 00:52:40,158
(GRUNTS)

816
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:46,122
(CHUCKLES)

817
00:52:46,873 --> 00:52:48,583
I never understood why some knights

818
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:50,418
felt the need to carry two swords.

819
00:52:52,587 --> 00:52:53,963
(EXHALES)

820
00:53:05,183 --> 00:53:06,184
Ooh!

821
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:13,024
You move well

822
00:53:16,194 --> 00:53:18,196
for a great beast of a woman.

823
00:53:18,988 --> 00:53:20,114
(GRUNTING)

824
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:26,287
You shouldn't grimace before you
lunge. It gives away the game.

825
00:53:40,593 --> 00:53:44,764
Bit of a quandary for you.
If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark.

826
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:48,101
But if you don't kill me,

827
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:50,228
I'm going to kill you.

828
00:53:56,609 --> 00:54:00,029
You're good. Graceless, but good.

829
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:13,334
See? If you were willing to hurt
me, you might have had me there.

830
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:32,353
(GROANS)

831
00:54:44,866 --> 00:54:46,200
- (JAIME PANTING)
- (HORSE NEIGHING)

832
00:54:46,409 --> 00:54:48,035
(HORSES APPROACHING)

833
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:59,964
Looks like your woman's
getting the better of you,

834
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:01,924
if you can call that a woman.

835
00:55:02,008 --> 00:55:06,220
We enjoy a good fight.
Gets our juices flowing.

836
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:11,017
The Flayed Man
of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste.

837
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:13,394
You sure he's the one?

838
00:55:13,478 --> 00:55:15,104
That's him, all right.

839
00:55:15,188 --> 00:55:18,232
I saw him fight at
the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding.

840
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:22,487
Give the man his silver.

841
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:26,657
Let us go and
my father will pay you whatever you want.

842
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,910
Enough to buy me a new head?

843
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:32,830
If the King in the North
hears I let the Kingslayer go,

844
00:55:32,914 --> 00:55:35,541
he'll be taking it right off.

845
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:37,251
I'd rather he takes yours.
