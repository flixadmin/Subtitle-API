1
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:04,103
Previously...

2
00:00:04,105 --> 00:00:08,207
I am the one and only
king of the shadowkhan.

3
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:10,876
But tarakudo's rein
came to an end

4
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:12,511
when the spirits
of his generals

5
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,613
were trapped
within masks.

6
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:16,348
9 oni generals,

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,750
9 masks.

8
00:00:17,752 --> 00:00:20,652
9 different tribes
of shadowkhan?

9
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:23,489
We must remove
demon mask
from host

10
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:25,224
in order
to defeat
shadowkhan!

11
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:26,458
Unh!

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,693
Whoa!

13
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,795
Whoa!

14
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:42,041
Getting warm.
Warmer.

15
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:43,942
Boiling.

16
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:46,578
Cooked.

17
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:50,783
This seems
way too easy,
doesn't it?

18
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:53,986
Easy?! We are at
the bottom of the ocean!

19
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:56,922
Yeah, but this is
the last oni mask.

20
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:58,757
Where are tarakudo
and his goons?

21
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,860
Where's the ultimate
good-versus-evil
battle royale?

22
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:04,897
I, for one,
am not complaining.

23
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:17,242
So our quest
is complete?

24
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,244
As you have
researched, tohru.

25
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,214
9 masks,
9 demon generals.

26
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:23,415
Which means
we won't be needing

27
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,250
these Hana fuda
cards anymore.

28
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,418
(Gasps)

29
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,822
Then why does tohru
have the willies?

30
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,291
(Gasps)

31
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,638
The masks...
Are destroyed?

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,074
That's a good
thing, right?

33
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,317
Oni.

34
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,838
How is this
happening?

35
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,773
Uncle not sure.

36
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:58,277
But it
must be your fault!

37
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:01,747
Many thanks
for our freedom, chan.

38
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:05,317
Now it is time
to surrender yours.

39
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,454
Aah!

40
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,992
Eat dragon heat!

41
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,763
Ungh!

42
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:19,932
Go, go, go!

43
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:30,142
Summon the dark ones.

44
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,882
Shadowkhan's
greatest hits.

45
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,033
Aah!

46
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,675
Hyah!

47
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,448
Whoa. New guy.

48
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,882
Ninja number 9.

49
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,118
What?!

50
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,854
(Pounding on door)

51
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,790
Captain black,
we have a breach.

52
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:19,992
Alert your agents and--

53
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:22,427
magic must
defeat magic.

54
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,264
We must
do research now.

55
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,211
Whoa, Nelly.

56
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,063
Uh, think
we can take 'em?

57
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,218
Uncle: Dark forces
are not attacking?

58
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,888
The combined power
of the 9 masks

59
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,023
can summon
enough shadowkhan

60
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:28,460
to engulf the earth
in eternal darkness.

61
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,799
(Chanting in Chinese)

62
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:40,105
Chi spell
will protect shop
from dark magic.

63
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:42,674
<i>Sensei,</i> none
of this makes sense.

64
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,043
I have reviewed
every inch of the legend.

65
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,978
Every inch?

66
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,421
Uh...It is a warning.

67
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:59,758
"Never conjoin
the 9 masks
in one location."

68
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,261
Hence the scattering
across the earth part.

69
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,866
Aiyah. The darkness
is already
taking hold.

70
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:11,870
All good magic
will soon fade
to nothing.

71
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,506
(Pounding on door)

72
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:15,674
(Gulps)

73
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:18,176
Something
wants in.

74
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:27,919
El toro!
Viper!

75
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,454
What are you
doing here?

76
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,456
Well, it looked
as if the world
was coming to an end...

77
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,657
And we
figured you four

78
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:35,427
might know a thing
or two about it.

79
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:37,362
So, we're supposed
to put a kibosh

80
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,664
on a vast army
of ninja magic how?

81
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,600
We must gather
the spell ingredients

82
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,001
to defeat
their leaders.

83
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:46,037
Japanese steel,
silk--ow!

84
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,874
Did you not
see the 9 masks

85
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:51,843
destroyed before
your very eyes?

86
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,678
The spells
which originally

87
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,281
defeated the demons
will no longer work

88
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:59,217
because the masks
which imprison them

89
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,520
no longer exist.

90
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:05,023
Our only hope
is to defeat tarakudo,

91
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:09,027
lord of all oni,
king of all shadowkhan.

92
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,630
But how do you beat a big
floating spirit-head?

93
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:12,764
Mm-mmm-mm.

94
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:13,865
(Cell phone rings)

95
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,435
Captain black,
are you all right?

96
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:17,669
Been better, Jackie.

97
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,538
We're operating
from a mobile unit.

98
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,206
The oni
seized headquarters.

99
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,574
Satellite
surveillance indicates

100
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:25,043
they're on their way
out of town
in teams of 2,

101
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:28,747
heading north, south,
east, and west.

102
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:30,816
No doubt to stake
their claims

103
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:33,318
to the 4 corners
of the globe.

104
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,555
Unless the j-team
stops them before
they get that far.

105
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,523
Be careful,
my friend.

106
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,125
Battle the oni?

107
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,161
Without the special
spell ingredients?

108
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:46,498
The fight
may be more fair
than you think, tohru.

109
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,634
The oni generals
will be unable
to summon their ninjas

110
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:53,672
without disrupting
the shroud of darkness.

111
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:56,942
Besides, t,
we're still
packin' t-power.

112
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,312
Snake has
my name on it.

113
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:01,713
I call dragon!

114
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,584
Dog and rat?

115
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:08,487
Oh! You're gonna hog
all the cool ones!

116
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,889
Jade, you will
remain here.

117
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,891
What?! No way!

118
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:14,960
Jade, please.

119
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:16,561
I could not
live with myself

120
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,363
if something
happened to you.

121
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,131
Aw.

122
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:28,139
Uncle: Today...
Dark forces must pay!

123
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:38,483
This bridge is closed.

124
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:44,155
(Growling)

125
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,655
Watch out, boys.

126
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:19,090
Snake in the grass.

127
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,466
(Moans)

128
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:29,734
<i>Sensei?</i>

129
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,736
The willies?

130
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,643
Ha ha.
Pardon me.
- I dropped something.

131
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:13,979
Antler action!

132
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,720
Oh, yeah!
I'm bad! You're sad!

133
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,421
Supermoose?

134
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:25,290
Jackie!

135
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,996
Jade, you were
supposed to be--

136
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:32,697
I decided I couldn't
live with myself

137
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,833
if something
happened to you.

138
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,868
Supermoose: Can you
feel the love?

139
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,270
Well, can ya, punk?

140
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,146
Many thanks
for removing

141
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,016
that ghastly
onion spell,
general ikazuki.

142
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,418
Section 13
- is far more inviting

143
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,086
with you
running things.

144
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,855
And our
shadow armies

145
00:10:56,857 --> 00:11:00,091
are advancing
as we speak,
master tarakudo.

146
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,693
Within hours
this planet

147
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,662
will succumb
to the forces of--

148
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,630
ooh.

149
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:08,266
The forces of ooh?

150
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:11,302
I'm picking up
some...Interference.

151
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,184
Aah!

152
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:40,865
Ya-ha!

153
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:44,803
Surf's up.

154
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,504
What?

155
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,273
Hmm.

156
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:50,642
You're quite a catch.

157
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,483
Yah!

158
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,023
Ah-choo!

159
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:07,158
Why did you
choose kittens?

160
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,427
Uncle is allergic!

161
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,229
All aboard!

162
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:13,998
Aiyah!

163
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,333
Ungh!

164
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:19,671
Uppercut!

165
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,806
Right hook!

166
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:24,642
Left antler!

167
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,046
(Jade cheers)

168
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:33,318
Getting...Weak.

169
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,519
Oh!

170
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:35,653
(Chuckles)

171
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,822
Nice try, gang.

172
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,130
It would seem humankind's
last line of defense...

173
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:48,266
Has reached
the end of
their line.

174
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,603
Allowing our
generals to resume
their progress

175
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,605
toward making
this world...

176
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,574
A much darker place.

177
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,385
(Groaning with strain)

178
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:09,821
Gel or no gel,
my hair won't cut it.

179
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:12,323
Anyone have
a Bobby pin?
Credit card?

180
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,526
Hana fuda card.

181
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:19,464
Whoa.

182
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,166
It cannot be.

183
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,468
A tenth mask.

184
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,969
Jade: Look who it is.

185
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,938
Tohru: Tarakudo.

186
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,175
But tohru's
research indicated
there are only 9.

187
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:32,343
Maybe tohru messed up
that part, too.

188
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:35,947
Each mask was created by
ancient good chi wizards

189
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:38,750
to imprison the demon
generals within them.

190
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:41,586
What if a tenth mask
were forged?

191
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:43,555
Intended to
trap tarakudo

192
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:44,923
like the others.

193
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:47,659
But the king
of the shadowkhan
got to it first.

194
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:50,628
If a tenth
mask exists,

195
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,264
the cards will tell us
where to find it.

196
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,365
(Gasps)

197
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,167
Uncle,
what is it?

198
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,303
Tarakudo
concealed the mask

199
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:01,840
in the one place
no mortal would
dare enter:

200
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,442
The shadow realm.

201
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,344
But how do we
get out of here?

202
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,679
And into there?

203
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:10,448
We need not
leave this cell.

204
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,616
All: Huh?

205
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:15,286
All shadows lead
to the shadow realm.

206
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:18,489
All that we need
is dark magic

207
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,258
to take us there.

208
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,659
Easy!

209
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:24,028
As any ex-queen
of the shadowkhan
can tell you,

210
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,563
wearing the sign
of tarakudo

211
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:26,931
gives you control
over ninjas.

212
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:28,700
It's tattoo time.

213
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:31,569
No, Jade.
It is far
too dangerous,

214
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,172
even if you have
done it before.

215
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,841
I volunteer tohru.

216
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:38,943
Wha--wha? M-m-me?

217
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:40,645
(Spits)

218
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:43,715
There is no better time
to face your fear of oni

219
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:47,752
than when
fate of world
is at stake.

220
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:52,390
Now, enter shadow
realm quickly!

221
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,625
How do I--

222
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:57,962
call upon darkness,
which now lies within you.

223
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:03,801
(Groans)

224
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:05,003
You're
the boss, t.

225
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,537
Just tell 'em
what to do.

226
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,539
Um, ahem.

227
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:12,277
Take me to--(Gulps)
The shadow realm.

228
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:15,680
Aah!

229
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:17,682
One more thing!

230
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:20,985
Uncle never leave shop
without magic socks.

231
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,787
He cannot
be serious.

232
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,889
Be thankful
he's not talking underwear.

233
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:30,662
This thread will
be your lifeline
to our realm.

234
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,732
Tug firmly
when you find mask.

235
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,634
(Moans)

236
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:44,776
Whoa!

237
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,993
Tohru had better
find mask

238
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:04,195
before we run
out of sock...

239
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:07,365
And before evil
within tattoo

240
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:10,501
consumes his
very being.

241
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,546
Whoa!

242
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:23,481
Tohru has mask.

243
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,950
Reel him in quickly!

244
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,355
Come on back, t.

245
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,494
Tohru!

246
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,762
You did it!

247
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:40,298
You have located
the tenth mask.

248
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,600
(Roars)

249
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:44,602
Tarakudo!

250
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:49,574
Aiyah!
We have lost tohru
to dark forces!

251
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,478
Who calls my na--
(Gasps)

252
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,715
I shall
destroy you all!

253
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:58,783
Aiyah!

254
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:04,555
All: Aah!

255
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,827
(Groans)

256
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,730
No one
touches my face.

257
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,999
Ikazuki!

258
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,934
Argh!

259
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,405
Oof!

260
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,607
Ooh!

261
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,442
Oni cream sandwich.

262
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:25,710
Jackie!

263
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:29,313
Uncle needs ingredient
to complete spell!

264
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,948
What ingredient?!

265
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,951
Hair of
Japanese samurai!

266
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:35,319
Heh heh heh.

267
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:39,090
A shame
that ancient Japan
is ancient history.

268
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:42,360
Argh!

269
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:45,063
Tohru's Japanese.
Think he has
any samurai blood?

270
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,731
One way
to find out.

271
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,472
Sorry, big guy.

272
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,340
Argh!

273
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,009
Just a little
off the topknot.

274
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,812
Oh, no, you don't!

275
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,817
Going up, handsome.

276
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,621
(Chanting in Chinese)

277
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,161
Whoa!

278
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,438
Whoa.
Tarakudo has legs.

279
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,207
Did your spell
do this, uncle?

280
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:30,708
Of course.

281
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,712
It is the only way
for mask to
stick to face.

282
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:37,748
Over my demon body.

283
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,118
No mental powers,
tarakudo?

284
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,920
It is about time
you fought fair.

285
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,998
Aah! Whoa!

286
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,267
Hyah!

287
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,405
Oh!

288
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:04,809
Now, Mr. chan,
if you'll hand over
the mask,

289
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:08,546
I'll take care
to dispose of it
once and for all.

290
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,550
Jade: Tarakudo?

291
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:14,552
Heads up!

292
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:16,621
No!

293
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:20,758
Noooooo!

294
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,562
Jackie.

295
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,871
Ohh.

296
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,722
10 demons and
a gajillion ninjas

297
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,391
in one teeny
tiny mask?

298
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:54,659
Cozy.

299
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:58,296
So...There are
no more masks?

300
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:02,033
Does tohru
have willies? No?

301
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:05,436
Then there
are no more masks.

302
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:08,472
Thanks to
the winning team.

303
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,747
Hey, Jackie,
do you ever go fishing?

304
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,849
Very, very little chance.

305
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:21,752
I never go,
like, call my friends,

306
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,788
"let's go fish today.
Holiday." Never.

307
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,758
Only when we are
- on the filming, on the boat.

308
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,460
Then I fish a little bit.

309
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:31,095
I'm not
this kind of person.

310
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:32,997
First, I hate water. Why?

311
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:35,700
Because I get seasick
when I'm on the boat.

312
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:39,804
Besides, I don't like
to spend so much time
to waiting, waiting.

313
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:42,640
I'd rather...Training.

314
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:45,009
But I do go,
but little time.
