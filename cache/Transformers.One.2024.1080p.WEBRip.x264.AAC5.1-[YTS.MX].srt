00:01:59,734 --> 00:02:01,470
Okay, let's see
what we got here.

4
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,406
Seen it. Seen it.

5
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:05,705
Huh. What's this about?

6
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:07,575
<i>At the dawn...
dawn... dawn...</i>

7
00:02:07,575 --> 00:02:08,939
<i>dawn... dawn... dawn...</i>

8
00:02:22,295 --> 00:02:23,954
Ah. Here we go.

9
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:25,593
<i>At the dawn of time,</i>

10
00:02:25,593 --> 00:02:29,168
<i>there was our gracious
and powerful creator,</i>

11
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:31,863
<i>Primus.</i>

12
00:02:31,863 --> 00:02:36,065
<i>To protect our universe,
he sacrificed his life force,</i>

13
00:02:36,065 --> 00:02:39,871
<i>transforming himself
into our planet,</i>

14
00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:42,643
<i>Cybertron.</i>

15
00:02:42,643 --> 00:02:45,415
<i>From within Cybertron's core,</i>

16
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,979
<i>Primus birthed
the first Transformers</i>

17
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:52,290
<i>known as the Primes,</i>

18
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,358
<i>the most powerful
Transformers,</i>

19
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:58,230
<i>appointed to lead and protect
future generations.</i>

20
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,960
<i>To assist them, Primus created
an entity of great power,</i>

21
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,160
<i>the Matrix of Leadership.</i>

22
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,163
The Matrix, there it is. Okay.
Good. Come on. Keep going.

23
00:03:08,163 --> 00:03:10,836
<i>With the Matrix
in the Primes' possession,</i>

24
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:17,348
<i>Cybertron's natural
power source, Energon,
flowed in abundance,</i>

25
00:03:17,348 --> 00:03:20,714

00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:37,401
<i>For generations,

31
00:03:37,401 --> 00:03:40,833
<i>until the Matrix
of Leadership was lost,</i>

32
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:44,540
<i>causing Energon
to no longer flow.</i>

33
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,709
Why does every legend
about the Matrix
end right there?

34
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:50,975
One of these
has to say what happened.

35
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:53,241
<i>Halt, criminal!
Prepare to be detained!</i>

36
00:03:53,241 --> 00:03:55,386
Oh, hey there.
<i>Halt, criminal!
Prepare to--</i>

37
00:03:56,882 --> 00:03:57,949
Uh-oh.

38
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:02,085
Freeze!
Get down!

39
00:04:02,085 --> 00:04:04,659
Well, hello, guys.
I'm so glad you're here.

40
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:06,056
Which way is the exit?

41
00:04:06,056 --> 00:04:07,596
I must've taken a wrong turn.

42
00:04:07,596 --> 00:04:10,434
It's that defective mining bot,
Oreon Pix!

43
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:11,897
Orion Pax.
Who cares?

44
00:04:11,897 --> 00:04:13,932
We told you
to never come back here!

45
00:04:13,932 --> 00:04:16,902
Why are we all yelling?
I'm gonna smash you!

46
00:04:16,902 --> 00:04:19,575
Hold on.
Whoa, whoa, hold on.
No need for violence.

47
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:23,205
How about this:
I run away, you chase me.
We play that game. Huh?

48
00:04:23,205 --> 00:04:25,240
Come on.
You're bigger, faster.
It'll be fun.

49
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,078
He doesn't have a cog.
Let's give him a head start.

50
00:04:28,078 --> 00:04:30,949
Why not?
It's not like
he can transform.

51
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:31,917
Oh, yeah?

52
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:33,919
Well, watch this.

53
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:39,089
Get him!

54
00:04:42,193 --> 00:04:43,599
I-- I-- Uh...

55
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:45,293
Something that flies.
Something that flies.

56
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:46,932
<i>Prepare to be detained!</i>

57
00:04:46,932 --> 00:04:48,703
<i>Halt, criminal!

58
00:04:48,703 --> 00:04:50,133
<i>Halt, criminal!</i>

59
00:05:03,313 --> 00:05:04,653
Come on! Start! Come on!

60
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:07,326
Whoa!

61
00:05:12,663 --> 00:05:14,696
Whoa. No, no, no, no!

62
00:05:17,437 --> 00:05:18,469
There he is!

63
00:05:22,508 --> 00:05:25,168
Ha-ha! So long, suck--

64
00:05:26,774 --> 00:05:28,336
Ooh, Energon.

65
00:05:28,336 --> 00:05:30,140
Evening, everyone.
Pardon me.

66
00:05:37,556 --> 00:05:38,951
Hey!

67
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:45,529
Whoa!

68
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:48,367
Ah, it's Orion.
Seriously, again?

69
00:06:00,975 --> 00:06:03,041
Okay, fellas!
Thanks for the head start.

70
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,482
You want to give me
another one?

71
00:06:04,482 --> 00:06:06,880
You're dead!
I'll take that as a no.

72
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,717
Hey!
Watch where you're going!

73
00:06:08,717 --> 00:06:10,554
Oh...
What did you say, no-cog?

74
00:06:10,554 --> 00:06:12,116
Sorry, sir,
I didn't mean you.

75
00:06:12,116 --> 00:06:13,986
I was referring
to the bot
who was behind you.

76
00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:15,493
What? Where'd he go?

77
00:06:15,493 --> 00:06:16,956
The filthy
red and blue bot?

78
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:18,925
Has a big mouth,
squeaky joints,

79
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:20,630
gives off a corroded
metallic stench?

80
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,324
Where is he?
He went that way.

81
00:06:22,324 --> 00:06:24,502
When I get
my hands on that bot...

82
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:35,238
All right, all clear.

83
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:37,878
Okay, D-16,
I may be a little rusty,

84
00:06:37,878 --> 00:06:39,550
but "corroded"?
That is too far.

85
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,684
Let me guess.
Chased out of
the archives?

86
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:43,752
Yeah.
I had to jump
out of a window this time.

87
00:06:43,752 --> 00:06:45,556
Almost died.
It was wild.

88
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:47,789
And digging through
ancient data
is worth dying for?

89
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:49,153
Yes, it is.

90
00:06:49,153 --> 00:06:50,627
I need a new best friend.

91
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:52,530
If there are clues
in our recorded history

92
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,631
that can help locate
the Matrix of Leadership,

93
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:56,028
they're in the archives.

94
00:06:56,028 --> 00:06:59,394
Sentinel Prime,
the Sentinel Prime,

95
00:06:59,394 --> 00:07:01,506
is up on the surface
right now,

96
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:04,740
risking his life for us
in search of the Matrix.

97
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,842
That's exactly what I'm doing.
I'm trying to help him.

98
00:07:07,842 --> 00:07:09,404
Yeah, okay.

99
00:07:09,404 --> 00:07:11,175
The sooner Energon
flows again,

100
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:13,342
the sooner we won't
have to mine for it.

101
00:07:13,342 --> 00:07:15,685
Don't you want
to choose your own path,
do whatever you want?

102
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,347
We're miners.
We mine, that's all.

103
00:07:18,347 --> 00:07:22,857
No, there has got to be
something more I can do.
I can feel it.

104
00:07:22,857 --> 00:07:24,892
Oh, yeah? Like the time
you had a "feeling"

105
00:07:24,892 --> 00:07:26,663
you could transform
without a cog?

106
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:28,456
You said you were never
gonna mention that again.

107
00:07:28,456 --> 00:07:30,898
Took me three days
to pry you open.

108
00:07:30,898 --> 00:07:32,031
Your feelings
get you in trouble.

109
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:33,571
Yeah, yeah.

110
00:07:33,571 --> 00:07:35,804
Just trust
in Sentinel Prime.
I do trust in him.

111
00:07:37,577 --> 00:07:39,467
Hey, if we did have cogs--

112
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:41,744
I'd transform
into a shovel
and beat you.

113
00:07:41,744 --> 00:07:43,680
I don't like how fast
you answered that.

114
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,584
But listen, if you did beat me,
I couldn't give you this awesome

115
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:48,850
Megatronus Prime thing
I have here. It's cool.

116
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,820
I'll give it
to someone else.
What Megatronus Prime thing?

117
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,690
Ah, it's nothing.
Just a, you know,

118
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,990
mint-condition Megatronus Prime
decal, first edition.

119
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,596
What?

120
00:07:58,596 --> 00:08:00,455
If you don't want it,
I can just throw it away.

121
00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:02,061
Throw it away? Don't--
That's not funny.
Let me see.

122
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:04,459
Wait. Don't grab.
You're gonna crease it.

123
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,101
You know, Sentinel says
Megatronus was the--

124
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:11,004
The strongest Prime
to ever live.

125
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:12,500
I know, buddy.

126
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,680
Looks good on you.
Ah, it's really cool.

127
00:08:18,376 --> 00:08:20,552
Thanks.
Always got your back.

128
00:08:21,214 --> 00:08:22,950
No matter what.

129
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:29,121
<i>Approaching sublevel station.
Stand clear of doors.</i>

130
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:31,057
<i>Mining teams,
prepare to unload.</i>

131
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,541
Metal to the pedal, drill bits.
This is it.

132
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:56,016
How much Energon have you mined
under my leadership?

133
00:08:56,016 --> 00:08:57,347
So much, Elita-1!

134
00:08:57,347 --> 00:08:59,349
And how perfect
is my mining record?

135
00:08:59,349 --> 00:09:00,856
So perfect, Elita-1!

136
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:03,221
We are a mere
30 units of Energon away

137
00:09:03,221 --> 00:09:05,256
from my promotion to supervisor.

138
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:06,829
Are you happy for me?

139
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:08,226
So happy, Elita-1!

140
00:09:09,328 --> 00:09:10,998
Elita-- I mean Captain,

141
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:13,704
you are looking especially shiny
this morning. New polish?

142
00:09:13,704 --> 00:09:15,706
Orion Pax,
I'm sorry that I somehow

143
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:17,499
gave you the impression
that we're friends.

144
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:18,973
Apology accepted.

145
00:09:18,973 --> 00:09:20,711
Light up that wall!
Let's go! Ten seconds!

146
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:22,339
Happy to take
the lead today, Captain.

147
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:23,978
Feeling like I have
enough power in me

148
00:09:23,978 --> 00:09:25,881
to drill down
and touch Primus myself.

149
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:27,542
You don't have
the touch or the power.

150
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:29,753
Ready positions,
rust buckets! Let's go!

151
00:09:29,753 --> 00:09:31,689
She's in a good mood today.
Mm-hmm.

152
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:33,416
You ready?
Always ready.

153
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,055
Let's punch in.

154
00:09:35,055 --> 00:09:36,760
Here we go.
This one won't be open long.

155
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,091
Brace it up!

156
00:09:38,698 --> 00:09:41,028
Here we go! Bridge!

157
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:42,260
Brace up!

158
00:09:43,703 --> 00:09:45,604
Lower channel is open.

159
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:52,369
Drill power on max!

160
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:53,469
Low bridge!

161
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:00,245
Drill it out!

162
00:10:02,447 --> 00:10:03,611
I tapped a vein!

163
00:10:08,187 --> 00:10:10,453
It's unstable!
We got to go, we got to move!

164
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,495
Evacuate!

165
00:10:21,398 --> 00:10:23,103
Everyone out!
Evacuate immediately!

166
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,775
The tunnel is closing.

167
00:10:24,775 --> 00:10:27,778
I repeat, the tunnel is closing!

168
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:30,946
You with me, D?
On your six! Keep going!

169
00:10:31,751 --> 00:10:32,915
Look out!

170
00:10:37,051 --> 00:10:38,283
Jazz is stuck!

171
00:10:38,283 --> 00:10:39,449
Elita, we've got
a trapped miner.

172
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:41,319
I'm falling back to assist.

173
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:43,090
<i>Negative.
Do not break protocol.
Evacuate!</i>

174
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,224
We're gonna need more lift.

175
00:10:45,224 --> 00:10:47,589
It's closing!
Just grab your pack and go.

176
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:48,832
Yeah. Good idea.

177
00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:51,164
What? No, I didn't mean it!

178
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:55,806
Pull him clear!

179
00:11:00,043 --> 00:11:01,603
<i>Pax, what's happening?</i>

180
00:11:01,603 --> 00:11:04,309
Nothing much. Just normal
protocol-following stuff.

181
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:05,915
It's all good.

182
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,248
Oh, that's not good.

183
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:11,822
Orion Pax, could you please exit
the tunnel of death?

184
00:11:11,822 --> 00:11:13,923
<i>Elita, it's about
to get messy out there!</i>

185
00:11:19,491 --> 00:11:21,062
Go, go, go!

186
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:25,869
Run! Run!

187
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:27,695
Hurry!
We're not gonna make it!

188
00:11:27,695 --> 00:11:29,807
Come on! Go, go, go!

189
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:38,673
What the hell, Pax?
I told you to evacuate.

190
00:11:38,673 --> 00:11:41,247
I did, eventually.
If I get fired because of you--

191
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:43,216
Oh, please.
They're not
gonna fire you.

192
00:11:44,219 --> 00:11:45,647
Elita-1, you're fired.

193
00:11:45,647 --> 00:11:48,716
What? Why? I followed
protocol to the letter.

194
00:11:48,716 --> 00:11:50,652
That is true.
I was the one
who broke the rules.

195
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:52,324
No one asked you!

196
00:11:52,324 --> 00:11:54,623
Darkwing, please,
I've worked too hard
for this.

197
00:11:54,623 --> 00:11:57,692
You are no-cog bots
with limited options.

198
00:11:57,692 --> 00:12:00,365
Report to waste management
immediately.

199
00:12:00,365 --> 00:12:02,037
Waste management?

200
00:12:02,037 --> 00:12:04,039
Elita...
Next time,
why don't you stop and think

201
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,568
before you ruin someone's life?

202
00:12:05,568 --> 00:12:06,734
I'm sorry!

203
00:12:08,406 --> 00:12:10,111
Hey, Darkwing!
Don't do it.

204
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,345
I may not have a cog,
but my finger can transform.

205
00:12:13,345 --> 00:12:16,282
Guess which one?
I'll give you
a "limited option."

206
00:12:18,715 --> 00:12:19,923
Excuse me, sir.

207
00:12:19,923 --> 00:12:21,826
Allow me.

208
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:24,257
I apologize
on his behalf for the--

209
00:12:24,257 --> 00:12:26,798
Why?

210
00:12:39,604 --> 00:12:42,671
That really hurt.

211
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:44,211
What'd you expect?
He's metal.

212
00:12:44,211 --> 00:12:45,883
You know you were
out of line,

213
00:12:45,883 --> 00:12:48,116
talking back
to a superior like that.

214
00:12:48,116 --> 00:12:50,283
Darkwing was out of line.
He deserves it.

215
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:54,584
Aren't you tired of being
treated like we're nothing?

216
00:12:55,653 --> 00:12:59,028
He had every right
to hit me.
I interfered.

217
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:03,758
Hey, and I appreciate
you having my back.

218
00:13:05,102 --> 00:13:06,871
I'm glad
you were there with me

219
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:08,466
to get punched in the face.
That was fun.

220
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:10,699
Anytime, buddy.

221
00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:12,602
<i>Attention, all sectors.</i>

222
00:13:12,602 --> 00:13:15,737
<i>Stand by for
a live transmission
from Sentinel Prime.</i>

223
00:13:15,737 --> 00:13:18,641
He's back?
He's back already?
Maybe he found the Matrix.

224
00:13:22,713 --> 00:13:25,219
<i>Is it on? Okay, thank you.</i>

225
00:13:25,219 --> 00:13:27,056
<i>Hello, my friends.</i>

226
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,618
<i>Hello, Iacon City!</i>

227
00:13:28,618 --> 00:13:31,258
<i>Hello to our saviors,
the industrious miners</i>

228
00:13:31,258 --> 00:13:34,261
<i>who toil selflessly to maintain
our Energon reserves.</i>

229
00:13:34,261 --> 00:13:37,198
<i>I celebrate you.</i>

230
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:40,564
Humility and presence!
That's leadership!

231
00:13:40,564 --> 00:13:42,533
Ah! Nobody does it better!

232
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:45,305
<i>Once again, I have narrowly
returned with my fleet</i>

233
00:13:45,305 --> 00:13:46,977
<i>after another
treacherous expedition</i>

234
00:13:46,977 --> 00:13:50,343
<i>across the desolate, dangerous
surface of our planet.</i>

235
00:13:50,343 --> 00:13:52,884
<i>I departed with hopes
of finding
the Matrix of Leadership,</i>

236
00:13:52,884 --> 00:13:55,084
<i>the key to bringing balance
to Cybertron.</i>

237
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,119
<i>I regret to inform you</i>

238
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,516
<i>that we've
returned empty-handed.</i>

239
00:13:59,781 --> 00:14:03,158
<i>This is a setback,
but not a failure.</i>

240
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:06,194
<i>Rest assured, I will find
the Matrix of Leadership,</i>

241
00:14:06,194 --> 00:14:08,658
<i>so that Energon can flow again.</i>

242
00:14:08,658 --> 00:14:10,462
<i>But that's in the future.</i>

243
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:13,762
<i>Right now,
I think we all
deserve a little fun!</i>

244
00:14:13,762 --> 00:14:16,303
<i>Tomorrow,
there will be no work.
All shifts off</i>

245
00:14:16,303 --> 00:14:20,010
<i>because tomorrow
is the Iacon 5000!</i>

246
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:23,343
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

247
00:14:23,343 --> 00:14:24,839
<i>My favorite event.</i>

248
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,875
<i>A high-octane race
all across Iacon City.</i>

249
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:32,154
<i>Let's all see which competitor
can prove they are truly
more than meets the eye.</i>

250
00:14:40,758 --> 00:14:41,790
D.

251
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:44,562
Psst! Hey, D.

252
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,441
Oh, good, you're up.
Come on, I have an idea.

253
00:14:55,441 --> 00:14:58,378
Whatever this is,
it better be good.

254
00:14:58,378 --> 00:15:00,083
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay. Listen.

255
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,184
All right, what if...
what if...

256
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:04,681
what if tomorrow

257
00:15:04,681 --> 00:15:08,520
we ran
in the Iacon 5000, huh?

258
00:15:09,556 --> 00:15:11,490
What if kill you
for waking me up?

259
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,228
No, no, no, hear me out.

260
00:15:13,228 --> 00:15:14,691
We don't even have to win!

261
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:16,066
Oh, that's good,
because we wouldn't.

262
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:19,267
But-- But if we beat
just one Transformer,

263
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:21,269
it proves
we're just as good as they are.

264
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:23,403
Not only would we
go down in history,

265
00:15:23,403 --> 00:15:26,736
the mining bots
that did the impossible,

266
00:15:26,736 --> 00:15:28,606
but we would show everyone
that we're--

267
00:15:28,606 --> 00:15:30,674
we're capable
of so much more!

268
00:15:30,674 --> 00:15:32,016
Or we get
publicly humiliated

269
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:33,743
and then busted
back to tier one.

270
00:15:33,743 --> 00:15:36,680
Yeah, but at least we would've
done something, you know?

271
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,319
Pax...
Come on, D.

272
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:39,782
Pax.

273
00:15:39,782 --> 00:15:42,653
We're mining bots
who can't transform.

274
00:15:42,653 --> 00:15:45,887
We can't fly,
we can't roll,

275
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:47,229
we can't race.

276
00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:48,296
Come on, let's go.

277
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:51,299
All right, fine.

278
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:53,037
Yeah, maybe you're right.

279
00:15:57,802 --> 00:15:59,109
Maybe.

280
00:16:00,772 --> 00:16:03,674
The Iacon 5000
is finally here!

281
00:16:03,674 --> 00:16:05,247
I have a surprise
for you. Come on.

282
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:07,447
Where are you going?
The stadium's that way.

283
00:16:07,447 --> 00:16:09,119
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Follow me.

284
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:11,220
Great.
We're gonna be late now.

285
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,354
I wanted good seats.

286
00:16:13,354 --> 00:16:16,225
We came all this way to miss
the opening ceremony.
This is wonderful!

287
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,996
Trust me,
I know what I'm doing.

288
00:16:18,856 --> 00:16:20,064
Hold up!

289
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:26,763
Get caught in one of those,
it'll launch you
halfway across the city.

290
00:16:26,763 --> 00:16:28,369
Okay,
where are you taking me?

291
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,769
Don't be a glitch, this will be
totally worth it. Trust me.

292
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:34,111
Hey, you don't be a glitch.

293
00:16:34,111 --> 00:16:35,805
Look, I know this is, like,
fun for you,

294
00:16:35,805 --> 00:16:37,378
like, we're joking around,

295
00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:39,974
but if you make me miss
any part of the Iacon 5000,

296
00:16:39,974 --> 00:16:43,549
I swear I will smelt
your face right off your...

297
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:50,325
<i>Welcome to the Iacon 5000.
There they are.</i>

298
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:55,627
<i>Put your hands together
as today's competitors
are taking the field.</i>

299
00:16:55,627 --> 00:16:58,597
Look! There's
Thunderglide and Behemoth!

300
00:16:58,597 --> 00:17:02,271
This is unbelievable!
I feel like I'm in the race!

301
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:07,034
You did this for me?

302
00:17:07,034 --> 00:17:08,145
No.

303
00:17:08,145 --> 00:17:10,147
I did this for us.

304
00:17:14,615 --> 00:17:17,682
<i>And now the moment
you've all been waiting for.</i>

305
00:17:17,682 --> 00:17:19,420
<i>The icon of Iacon!</i>

306
00:17:20,357 --> 00:17:22,555
<i>The savior of Cybertron!</i>

307
00:17:22,555 --> 00:17:26,163
<i>Quintessons fear him,
but we love him!</i>

308
00:17:26,163 --> 00:17:29,331
<i>Our leader,
the one and only...</i>

309
00:17:29,331 --> 00:17:31,135
<i>Sentinel Prime!</i>

310
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,433
I love you, Sentinel!

311
00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:39,143
Yes! It feels so good
to be here with you all today.

312
00:17:42,577 --> 00:17:45,677
My friends.
My Cybertronian family.

313
00:17:46,843 --> 00:17:49,043
It has been
precisely 50 cycles

314
00:17:49,043 --> 00:17:51,584
since the Quintessons
attacked our home.

315
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:55,126
Fifty cycles since we lost
the Matrix of Leadership

316
00:17:55,126 --> 00:17:57,755
and our Energon supply
dried up.

317
00:17:57,755 --> 00:18:01,825
Fifty cycles since the battle
that killed the other Primes,

318
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:03,794
my brothers
and sisters in arms.

319
00:18:03,794 --> 00:18:08,029
Today we honor the Primes
who gave their lives for ours

320
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:11,736
and we show them
that the strength of Cybertron
will never be diminished.

321
00:18:15,973 --> 00:18:18,578
Racers, on your marks!

322
00:18:23,387 --> 00:18:26,223
I can't believe we get to watch
from the starting line.

323
00:18:26,223 --> 00:18:28,753
The best seats
in the house!

324
00:18:28,753 --> 00:18:29,853
Why'd you bring jetpacks?

325
00:18:29,853 --> 00:18:31,591
<i>Get set!</i>

326
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:34,396
It's time to show them
we are more than meets the eye.

327
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:35,793
Oh, no.

328
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:38,862
<i>And they're off!</i>

329
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:47,904
Are you crazy?
Sure feels like it.

330
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:52,909
<i>The Iacon 5000 has begun!</i>

331
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:57,782
I'm sorry, are those
miners in the race?

332
00:18:57,782 --> 00:19:00,224
Miners!
Those are miners,
like us!

333
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:03,117
<i>I can't believe
what I'm seeing here!
Miners trying to run</i>

334
00:19:03,117 --> 00:19:04,822
<i>in the Iacon 5000!</i>
You've got to be kidding me.

335
00:19:04,822 --> 00:19:06,923
<i>This is insane!</i>

336
00:19:06,923 --> 00:19:09,563
There are miners
in the race!
Miners?

337
00:19:09,563 --> 00:19:10,795
No way!
They can't even transform!

338
00:19:10,795 --> 00:19:12,632
It's Orion Pax and D-16!

339
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:19,034
<i>This is a first
in Iacon 5000 history.</i>

340
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:21,135
<i>How are they going to survive?</i>

341
00:19:23,511 --> 00:19:26,008
If we survive this,
I'm gonna kill you!

342
00:19:26,008 --> 00:19:27,482
I accept those terms.

00:19:32,885 --> 00:19:35,853
<i>It's Tailwind
pulling into the lead
down the main stretch</i>

344
00:19:35,853 --> 00:19:38,625
<i>followed by Strafe and Skyfire!</i>

345
00:19:40,121 --> 00:19:41,628
Hey, look out!

346
00:19:44,193 --> 00:19:46,732
I owe you one.
More like a thousand.

347
00:19:49,198 --> 00:19:50,934
I can't believe
we're not in last place!

348
00:19:53,807 --> 00:19:56,005
Eat it, miner!

349
00:19:56,005 --> 00:19:59,008
<i>Darkwing delivers
a devastating blow!</i>
Gotcha!

350
00:20:05,918 --> 00:20:08,182
We're not fast enough!
Improvise!

351
00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:16,300
Hey! Get off!
Spinout! Big fan!

352
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,566
Hey!
Jetstorm, I'm so sorry.
Big fan!

353
00:20:19,536 --> 00:20:21,195
Get off!

354
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:34,241
Time it just right!

355
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:36,111
And... now!

356
00:20:37,587 --> 00:20:38,916
Move!

357
00:20:42,086 --> 00:20:45,186
<i>And the miners
have fallen way behind.</i>

358
00:20:45,186 --> 00:20:48,057
<i>We can now focus
on the real contenders
in this race.</i>

359
00:21:05,714 --> 00:21:09,353
<i>I don't believe it!
The miners take down Darkwing!</i>

360
00:21:10,587 --> 00:21:12,048
Oh, miners!

361
00:21:12,048 --> 00:21:13,786
Great effort,
Darkwing!

362
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:15,623
That worked!
It actually worked!

363
00:21:15,623 --> 00:21:17,790
Is this the dumbest thing
we've ever done?

364
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,330
Oh, yeah, it's up there!

365
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,261
No, no, no!

366
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:29,802
Whoa!

367
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:34,642
Wait!

368
00:21:34,642 --> 00:21:35,874
Go, go, go!

369
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:40,142
<i>A four-bot pileup
in the magnetic tunnel</i>

370
00:21:40,142 --> 00:21:43,453
<i>and the two miners are now
in first position!</i>

371
00:21:43,453 --> 00:21:46,423
<i>This is unbelievable!</i>

372
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,824
Ah!

373
00:21:51,824 --> 00:21:53,188
D!

374
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:55,190
No. Go. Leave me!

375
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,500
No, we do this together.

376
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,601
<i>One miner is now
carrying the other</i>

377
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:01,966
<i>mere steps
from the finish line</i>

378
00:22:01,966 --> 00:22:05,739
<i>in the most amazing,
sensational, dramatic,
heartrending, exciting,</i>

379
00:22:05,739 --> 00:22:07,708
<i>thrilling finish
in the history of--</i>

380
00:22:11,615 --> 00:22:13,483
<i>We have a winner!</i>

381
00:22:13,483 --> 00:22:16,618
<i>Chromia comes from behind
to take the prize.</i>

382
00:22:16,618 --> 00:22:18,983
<i>Talk about an Iacon 5000
for the ages.</i>

383
00:22:20,985 --> 00:22:22,756
Well, second place
is still pretty good.

384
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,763
<i>Paging Dr. Ratchet.
Dr. Ratchet to Medical Bay 94.</i>

385
00:22:29,763 --> 00:22:31,864
Do not worry.
You will be fixed up
in no time.

386
00:22:31,864 --> 00:22:34,163
Did I win?

387
00:22:34,163 --> 00:22:35,802
You participated.

388
00:22:35,802 --> 00:22:37,100
Yay!

389
00:22:38,906 --> 00:22:40,708
So...

390
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,875
how long do you think
we'll be here?

391
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,140
I'm not talking to you.

392
00:22:49,312 --> 00:22:51,345
You know what?
I can't believe
you made me do that.

393
00:22:51,345 --> 00:22:53,820
We are so screwed!
Thought you weren't
talking to me.

394
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,955
Hey, look, I know
it's all a big joke to you.
But not me.

395
00:22:56,955 --> 00:22:59,188
I was paying my dues.
I was going places.

396
00:22:59,188 --> 00:23:00,563
And now they're gonna
bust me down

397
00:23:00,563 --> 00:23:02,026
I-- I don't even know
how many tiers!

398
00:23:02,026 --> 00:23:03,830
I'm sorry, D.

399
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,568
But come on,
didn't you feel it?

400
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:07,669
Even for just a second,
didn't you feel liberated?

401
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:09,297
Didn't you feel like
you were something else?

402
00:23:09,297 --> 00:23:12,168
Like you could be more
than what they say you are?

403
00:23:12,168 --> 00:23:14,874
Yeah, I felt it. I did.

404
00:23:16,108 --> 00:23:17,547
But it doesn't matter.

405
00:23:17,547 --> 00:23:19,912
We're going to get
punished and demoted.

406
00:23:19,912 --> 00:23:23,014
Sentinel Prime
saw the whole thing.

407
00:23:23,014 --> 00:23:25,280
This is so embarrassing.

408
00:23:39,098 --> 00:23:39,965
It's clear.

409
00:23:44,037 --> 00:23:45,399
Orion Pax.

410
00:23:46,171 --> 00:23:47,874
D-16.

411
00:23:47,874 --> 00:23:49,513
What you two did today

412
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:52,109
was one of the
craziest things
I've ever seen.

413
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:54,617
Sir, this is all my idea,
and we're so sorry.

414
00:23:54,617 --> 00:23:56,047
I loved it!

415
00:23:56,047 --> 00:23:57,114
You did?

416
00:23:57,114 --> 00:23:58,984
How could anyone
not love it?

417
00:23:58,984 --> 00:24:01,756
You gave my best racers
a real run for their money.

418
00:24:01,756 --> 00:24:04,154
So we're not
getting demoted?

419
00:24:04,154 --> 00:24:05,353
Demoted?

420
00:24:10,094 --> 00:24:11,458
Demoted.

421
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:14,461
What is happening?

422
00:24:17,068 --> 00:24:19,268
The fact of the matter
is we're halfway
into the first shift

423
00:24:19,268 --> 00:24:24,647
since the race ended
and that mining crew
has already reached 150% quota.

424
00:24:24,647 --> 00:24:26,781
You inspired them
to work harder!

425
00:24:26,781 --> 00:24:28,882
Sentinel Prime, sir,

426
00:24:28,882 --> 00:24:33,150
we joined the race
to show everyone our potential.

427
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,086
That we bots can do
more than just mine--

428
00:24:35,086 --> 00:24:38,419
Outstanding! I love a bot
that can think for himself.

429
00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:40,157
Perhaps you two
could tour the mines,

430
00:24:40,157 --> 00:24:42,456
speak to your brethren, and
help them see their potential.

431
00:24:42,456 --> 00:24:44,601
Wow! Okay, great.

432
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:46,394
That sounds incredible.

433
00:24:46,394 --> 00:24:48,297
I would love to--
Sir, it's time.

434
00:24:48,297 --> 00:24:49,936
Ah, yes.

435
00:24:49,936 --> 00:24:51,608
I'm sorry, friends.

436
00:24:51,608 --> 00:24:53,676
We're preparing
our next travel
to the surface.

437
00:24:53,676 --> 00:24:56,470
But in the meantime,
I've got a treat for you.

438
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,616
Hang tight.
Airachnid, have someone
escort these heroes

439
00:24:59,616 --> 00:25:01,475
to my personal
service facilities.

440
00:25:02,346 --> 00:25:04,478
Best care in Iacon.

441
00:25:04,478 --> 00:25:06,315
Until next time, legends.

442
00:25:10,123 --> 00:25:14,092
Sentinel Prime.
The Sentinel Prime!

443
00:25:14,092 --> 00:25:16,193
You still mad at me?
I am less mad at you.

444
00:25:16,193 --> 00:25:18,833
I'm telling you, D--
I got a feeling
that everything's gonna change

445
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:19,999
and we're gonna go--

446
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:22,837
Miners!

447
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:25,906
Hi, Darkwing.

448
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:29,470
Oh, no, no, no.
No!

449
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:33,045
Wait, wait!
You don't understand!

450
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:35,542
We were supposed to go
to Sentinel Prime's service pod!

451
00:25:35,542 --> 00:25:38,853
You two dolts aren't going
to see anyone ever again.

452
00:25:38,853 --> 00:25:40,349
I'll make sure of that.

453
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:42,659
You're making a mistake!
Ask Sentinel!

454
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:44,793
I hate that guy!

455
00:25:58,567 --> 00:26:00,336
You! How did you get down here?

456
00:26:00,336 --> 00:26:02,074
There's no access to this level.

457
00:26:02,074 --> 00:26:04,109
There is nobody
down here but me.

458
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:06,650
Oh, my gosh, you're real!

459
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,884
You're others!
You're not... me!

460
00:26:09,884 --> 00:26:12,623
You're here,
and you're not me!

461
00:26:14,856 --> 00:26:16,858
Uh, yeah.
Awesome!

462
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:19,355
I am so sorry. That must
have been weird for you.

463
00:26:19,355 --> 00:26:21,555
I just haven't had
a lot of company

464
00:26:21,555 --> 00:26:23,667
since they put me
down here in sublevel 50.

465
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:26,934
Fifty? But there
are only 40 sublevels.

466
00:26:26,934 --> 00:26:28,595
That's what I thought!

467
00:26:28,595 --> 00:26:31,565
Turns out there are ten more,
and they are not pleasant.

468
00:26:31,565 --> 00:26:33,336
Probably why nobody ever
really talks about them.

469
00:26:33,336 --> 00:26:34,744
How long have you
been down here?

470
00:26:34,744 --> 00:26:36,405
How long have I been here?

471
00:26:36,405 --> 00:26:39,606
Let's see, somewhere
between a long time and forever?

472
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:43,346
I mean, I had other jobs,
but I kept getting reassigned

473
00:26:43,346 --> 00:26:45,216
'cause I'm so good
at what I do.

474
00:26:45,216 --> 00:26:48,252
Oh! I'm B-127, by the way.

475
00:26:48,252 --> 00:26:49,726
But you can call me B.

476
00:26:49,726 --> 00:26:51,387
And I'm actually
working on some nicknames.

477
00:26:51,387 --> 00:26:54,093
The one I'm floating right now
is Badassatron.

478
00:26:54,093 --> 00:26:57,866
Which is actually pronounced...
"Badassatron."

479
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,230
But if you have any critiques--

480
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:02,233
Yeah, great.
How do we get
out of here?

481
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:04,169
Great question. You don't.

482
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:05,775
We don't?
Nope.

483
00:27:05,775 --> 00:27:08,074
We have limited access
to the waste management area,

484
00:27:08,074 --> 00:27:12,144
but the new shift manager there
does not like distractions.

485
00:27:12,144 --> 00:27:15,180
No, they prefer we stay here
on the task at hand.

486
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,753
Which is?
Oh!

487
00:27:16,753 --> 00:27:19,690
The scrap comes in
from the chute there

488
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,483
onto the conveyor belt.

489
00:27:21,483 --> 00:27:24,420
Our job is to look for anything
that might be worth salvaging

490
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,126
before it hits the furnace
and gets smelted.

491
00:27:27,126 --> 00:27:29,161
So you watch garbage burn.

492
00:27:29,161 --> 00:27:30,657
Yes!

493
00:27:30,657 --> 00:27:32,296
It is so great
that you're here now.

494
00:27:32,296 --> 00:27:34,199
I can't wait to learn
everything about you.

495
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:36,036
And then tell you
everything about me!

496
00:27:36,036 --> 00:27:38,940
I have a lot of hopes and dreams
that I am just dying to share

497
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,271
with one or two
new best friends.

498
00:27:40,271 --> 00:27:42,471
Uh, yeah, I would love to--

499
00:27:42,471 --> 00:27:44,143
Where are my manners?

500
00:27:44,143 --> 00:27:45,947
Come on, I'll introduce you
to the rest of the crew.

501
00:27:45,947 --> 00:27:47,949
Hey, guys, we've got company!

502
00:27:49,183 --> 00:27:51,755
This is EP-508,

503
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:55,517
this is A-A-Tron,
and this fella here is Steve.

504
00:27:55,517 --> 00:27:57,926
"Steve"?
Yeah, he's foreign.

505
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,895
Do they talk back to you?

506
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:02,194
Um, they're not real.

507
00:28:02,194 --> 00:28:04,834
Jeez, you think I'm that crazy?

508
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:06,297
It's just
you've been down here a--

509
00:28:06,297 --> 00:28:07,870
No, I was talking to Steve.

510
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:10,499
Classic Steve.

511
00:28:10,499 --> 00:28:12,303
What is that?
Look at this guy.

512
00:28:12,303 --> 00:28:15,339
It's coming from inside.

513
00:28:15,979 --> 00:28:17,847
Oh! Steve! No!

514
00:28:17,847 --> 00:28:21,048
I am so sorry.
Steve, no!

515
00:28:21,048 --> 00:28:23,149
We can fix it, don't worry.
My Steve!

516
00:28:25,989 --> 00:28:28,055
<i>Quintesson ambush!</i>

517
00:28:28,055 --> 00:28:31,190
<i>Calling the High Guard
for immediate support.
Immediate support!</i>

518
00:28:31,863 --> 00:28:33,456
That's Alpha Trion.

519
00:28:33,456 --> 00:28:34,996
One of the Primes?

520
00:28:34,996 --> 00:28:37,328
<i>Repeat,
Zeta Prime has fallen!</i>

521
00:28:37,328 --> 00:28:40,166
It's an SOS message.
<i>Protect the Matrix!</i>

522
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:43,433
<i>Sending location coordinates.
Sending location coordinates.</i>

523
00:28:46,944 --> 00:28:49,340
Holy Primus!

524
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,640
Those are coordinates
to a location on the surface.

525
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,249
This could be
where the Primes died
in the Quintesson war.

526
00:28:57,249 --> 00:29:00,681
Which means
this is where we could find

527
00:29:00,681 --> 00:29:03,024
the Matrix of Leadership.

528
00:29:03,024 --> 00:29:06,555
What are you talking about?
It's an old beacon
inside a statue made of garbage.

529
00:29:06,555 --> 00:29:08,194
Or it's a clue
of how we could find

530
00:29:08,194 --> 00:29:10,966
the Matrix of Leadership.
No. No way. Absolutely not!

531
00:29:10,966 --> 00:29:13,760
Hey, D, come on,
this could be our chance
to show everyone we're not--

532
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,201
You already tried
to "show everyone"

533
00:29:15,201 --> 00:29:16,730
in the race
you tricked me
into running,

534
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,105
which got us
stuck down here

535
00:29:18,105 --> 00:29:20,536
in this waste hole
with this, uh...

536
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,473
really cool guy.

537
00:29:23,473 --> 00:29:25,706
Oh, thank you.
I'm just saying--

538
00:29:25,706 --> 00:29:27,510
There's a reason
no one goes
to the surface.

539
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,248
It's dangerous!

540
00:29:29,248 --> 00:29:31,613
I'm waiting right here
until Sentinel Prime
finds us.

541
00:29:31,613 --> 00:29:33,483
Oh, okay. Yeah. Hmm.

542
00:29:33,483 --> 00:29:36,552
Well, we'll just
stay here forever.
That cool with you, B?

543
00:29:36,552 --> 00:29:37,960
Forever? This is great!

544
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,193
I have new coworkers
and roommates.

545
00:29:40,193 --> 00:29:42,129
There's plenty of room
now that Steve is dead.

546
00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:44,263
I usually sleep
on the conveyor belt,
but you can totally have it.

547
00:29:44,263 --> 00:29:45,792
I'll sleep in the corner
next to A-A-Tron.

548
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:47,530
Plenty of room
for you to stretch out, too,

549
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,939
'cause you're taller than I am.
Know what I mean?

550
00:29:49,939 --> 00:29:54,042
Hey, D, what do you think
Sentinel's reaction would be
if you personally handed him

551
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,012
the Matrix of Leadership
that you found?

552
00:29:57,012 --> 00:29:59,916
Okay, stop.
I know what you're
trying to do.

553
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:02,182
And it's
definitely working.
I'm in.

554
00:30:02,182 --> 00:30:04,712
Hah, ha! Yeah, buddy.
How do we get
to the surface?

555
00:30:04,712 --> 00:30:06,890
Pfft! You kidding me?
The surface?

556
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,024
Easy. I know a way.

557
00:30:10,192 --> 00:30:11,785
But it won't be easy.

558
00:30:12,755 --> 00:30:14,755
Why is there so much trash? Ah!

559
00:30:14,755 --> 00:30:17,131
Warn me
next time, please.
My mouth was open.

560
00:30:17,131 --> 00:30:19,628
Only 49 sublevels to go!

561
00:30:20,697 --> 00:30:22,796
Waste-disposal trains
are the only vehicles

562
00:30:22,796 --> 00:30:24,974
that go all the way
to the surface.

563
00:30:24,974 --> 00:30:27,438
Yeah, but they
don't allow passengers.
The trains are autonomous.

564
00:30:27,438 --> 00:30:29,836
Yeah, that's the
"won't be easy" part.

565
00:30:29,836 --> 00:30:32,311
It's perfect.
We'll be safe
inside the train.

566
00:30:39,782 --> 00:30:41,419
That's the last one.
Send 'er up!

567
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:49,163
Hold up! One more.

568
00:30:53,235 --> 00:30:54,531
I'll lock it down.

569
00:31:02,607 --> 00:31:05,839
Thanks for being an idiot,
whoever you are.

570
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:08,985
Turning you in will
definitely get me promoted
back up a rank or two.

571
00:31:08,985 --> 00:31:11,020
Got her!

572
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,219
No, wait, I--

573
00:31:12,219 --> 00:31:13,550
Elita! Stop!

574
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,354
Orion?
Hold on, let me--

575
00:31:15,354 --> 00:31:16,586
Security! Sound the ala--

576
00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:24,902
She's headed to the engine!
Don't worry, I got this.

577
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:29,236
Hold on, let me explain!
We're on a mission!

578
00:31:29,236 --> 00:31:31,403
So am I. To ruin your life.

579
00:31:41,943 --> 00:31:45,021
Elita, wait. We found a message.
We know where--

580
00:31:45,749 --> 00:31:47,881
This bot is crazy! Who is she?

581
00:31:47,881 --> 00:31:50,422
Dead end, Elita.
There's no way...

582
00:31:50,422 --> 00:31:51,621
Well, she's gone.

583
00:32:06,473 --> 00:32:07,901
Whoa!

584
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:10,838
Why? Why am I doing this?
Why am I doing this?

585
00:32:10,838 --> 00:32:11,982
Climb faster!

586
00:32:26,955 --> 00:32:28,295
Gotcha!

587
00:33:01,561 --> 00:33:03,660
Ah, the surface.

588
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,201
It's beautiful.

589
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:12,141
I am speechless.

590
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:15,639
Elita, listen to me.

591
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:17,905
We know where
the Matrix of Leadership is.

592
00:33:17,905 --> 00:33:19,940
Oh, sure.
And I'm really a Prime.

593
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:23,350
I just prefer loading
crates of toxic waste.

594
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,847
Whoa.
Where did you get this?

595
00:33:25,847 --> 00:33:27,618
From my friend Steve.
Orion killed him.

596
00:33:27,618 --> 00:33:30,093
I did not kill Steve.
He was never alive.

597
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:31,490
What?
Look.

598
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,690
Sentinel told us
he was going to the surface,

599
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,593
and then we found this message.

600
00:33:35,593 --> 00:33:37,826
We figured that we could
hand deliver it to him

601
00:33:37,826 --> 00:33:40,829
or scout
the locations ourselves.

602
00:33:40,829 --> 00:33:42,138
Whichever comes first.

603
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:45,702
This was too important to wait.

604
00:33:46,507 --> 00:33:48,408
It will change all of our lives.

605
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,213
No, no, no, no.

606
00:33:51,213 --> 00:33:54,513
I'm not going to get demoted
again because of you.

607
00:33:54,513 --> 00:33:56,383
I'm turning this rig around
and I'm notifying the--

608
00:33:56,383 --> 00:33:58,319
Hey, guys? Guys?

609
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,386
What is that?

610
00:34:03,326 --> 00:34:05,018
Is it getting bigger?

611
00:34:06,329 --> 00:34:07,856
Or closer?

612
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:17,932
No, no, no, no, no, no!

613
00:34:20,838 --> 00:34:22,541
Are you closing?
Don't close. Stop closing.

614
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:23,542
It's closed!

615
00:34:23,542 --> 00:34:24,741
Oh, come on!

616
00:34:30,947 --> 00:34:33,783
Oh, now I know why
no one comes to the surface!

617
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,544
<i>Elita?</i>

618
00:34:59,776 --> 00:35:01,877
Elita?

619
00:35:01,877 --> 00:35:03,351
You okay?

620
00:35:05,817 --> 00:35:07,619
Please stop
punching me in the face.

621
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:08,818
Can you help?

622
00:35:08,818 --> 00:35:10,655
Iacon-- The train--

623
00:35:10,655 --> 00:35:13,889
Where's the train?
Relax, okay? Here it comes.

624
00:35:13,889 --> 00:35:15,924
And there it goes.

625
00:35:15,924 --> 00:35:19,059
Okay, I was wrong about that.
It was going the other way.

626
00:35:26,706 --> 00:35:31,247
Okay, so I think
this is us,

627
00:35:31,247 --> 00:35:33,777
and if we follow
the path to--
Now you listen to me,

628
00:35:33,777 --> 00:35:36,351
Mr. "Zero Seconds
Since My Last Accident"!

629
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:39,453
I'll go on your little quest
because I don't have a choice.

630
00:35:39,453 --> 00:35:43,325
But I carry the map, I navigate,
and if this leads to nothing,

631
00:35:43,325 --> 00:35:45,921
then I'm dragging you
and those two idiot go-bots

632
00:35:45,921 --> 00:35:47,329
back to Iacon City

633
00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:49,991
and to the first
supervisor depot we see,

634
00:35:49,991 --> 00:35:52,961
at which point you will explain
everything that's happened,

635
00:35:52,961 --> 00:35:54,765
using words that reflect me

636
00:35:54,765 --> 00:35:57,031
in a very positive light!
Got it?

637
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:59,308
Yeah, okay.
Deal. Great. All right.

638
00:35:59,308 --> 00:36:01,640
Let's go!
She's joining us?

639
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,279
Fantastic!

640
00:36:03,279 --> 00:36:06,678
Hi there. Uh, Elita, right?
Am I saying that right?

641
00:36:06,678 --> 00:36:08,944
Wanted to formally
introduce myself.

642
00:36:08,944 --> 00:36:12,618
I'm B-127. You kneed me
in the face earlier, back there.

643
00:36:12,618 --> 00:36:15,291
You can call me B,
or Badassatron.

644
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:17,051
It's a nickname
some of the guys gave me.

645
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:19,460
I don't know. I didn't give it
to myself or anything.

646
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,562
Actually, it's pronounced...
"Badassatron,"

647
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:25,664
in case you were wondering.

648
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:28,964
Badassatron.

649
00:36:28,964 --> 00:36:30,966
You like that, right?

650
00:36:30,966 --> 00:36:33,166
Badass--
I'm gonna need you
to talk less.

651
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:34,937
Sure! No-- Yeah, no problem.

652
00:36:34,937 --> 00:36:36,642
What am I talking less about,
my nickname?

653
00:36:36,642 --> 00:36:38,941
That's fine with me.
Got some mountains over here...

654
00:36:38,941 --> 00:36:40,844
Hey. You're thinking
about what you'll say

655
00:36:40,844 --> 00:36:42,813
when you hand the Matrix
to Sentinel, aren't you?

656
00:36:42,813 --> 00:36:44,111
I can't help it.

657
00:36:44,111 --> 00:36:46,388
D, we're really doing this.

658
00:36:46,388 --> 00:36:49,853
So glad
I'm out here with you.
This was a great idea.

659
00:36:49,853 --> 00:36:51,492
I'm just having a good time.

660
00:36:51,492 --> 00:36:53,054
How much further
is the Matrix on the map?

661
00:36:53,054 --> 00:36:54,561
Make an educated guesstimate.

662
00:36:54,561 --> 00:36:56,530
This is the coolest thing
that has ever happened

663
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,499
to anyone anywhere,
I'm telling you!

664
00:36:58,499 --> 00:37:00,897
<i>♪ Not one, not two
Not three, but four ♪</i>

665
00:37:00,897 --> 00:37:04,164
<i>♪ Four best friends who are
Walking through the door ♪</i>

666
00:37:04,164 --> 00:37:05,572
There's no doors,
we're outside.

667
00:37:05,572 --> 00:37:07,068
Hey, look,
there's more of it over here.

668
00:37:07,068 --> 00:37:09,675
What is it?
It's not metal.

669
00:37:09,675 --> 00:37:13,140
It's like some kind
of weird nature. It's weird.

670
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,548
So are they.

671
00:37:14,548 --> 00:37:16,143
<i>♪ Going to the Matrix ♪</i>

672
00:37:16,143 --> 00:37:17,683
<i>♪ With my best friends ♪</i>

673
00:37:17,683 --> 00:37:19,718
What was that?

674
00:37:30,058 --> 00:37:32,060
Um...

675
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,601
I think this is not right.
We should go.

676
00:37:34,601 --> 00:37:36,438
Yeah, good idea.
Run!

677
00:37:36,438 --> 00:37:38,506
What are we running from?

678
00:38:03,223 --> 00:38:05,566
What is that?
Oh, no.

679
00:38:05,566 --> 00:38:07,733
It's a Quintesson ship.
What?

680
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:10,439
What do we do?
What do we do?
Shh! Quiet.

681
00:38:21,012 --> 00:38:23,320
It's scanning for life-forms.
Move, move!

682
00:38:28,985 --> 00:38:30,283
Wait!

683
00:38:33,662 --> 00:38:35,123
Go, go, go, go!

684
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:44,264
Come on!

685
00:38:44,264 --> 00:38:46,002
They're not gonna make it.

686
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,276
Whoa.

687
00:39:13,163 --> 00:39:15,163
What-- What were they
searching for?

688
00:39:15,163 --> 00:39:17,000
Someone to hug, B.
How should I know?

689
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,068
I'm not waiting around
to find out.

690
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,444
This way.
We're close.

691
00:39:21,444 --> 00:39:24,238
Quintessons haven't
been here for 50 cycles.

692
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:26,911
It doesn't make sense.
There's nothing out here.

693
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,508
A cave with teeth.
Nothing scary about that.

694
00:39:59,682 --> 00:40:02,177
Knives coming
out of the ceiling. Amazing.

695
00:40:03,213 --> 00:40:04,685
Everyone,
do we have to go insi--?

696
00:40:04,685 --> 00:40:06,753
Okay, yep, we're going in.

697
00:40:06,753 --> 00:40:09,052
Why shouldn't we? Just walking
into the scariest place

698
00:40:09,052 --> 00:40:10,559
I've ever seen
in my entire life.

699
00:40:12,354 --> 00:40:13,628
This is ridiculous.

700
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,983
I don't believe it.

701
00:40:39,755 --> 00:40:41,117
The Primes.

702
00:40:42,758 --> 00:40:43,889
We're here.

703
00:41:19,828 --> 00:41:21,861
Megatronus Prime.

704
00:41:36,273 --> 00:41:37,646
Zeta Prime.

705
00:41:40,618 --> 00:41:41,980
The Matrix!

706
00:41:45,282 --> 00:41:46,556
It's gone.

707
00:41:49,022 --> 00:41:50,483
Let's keep looking.

708
00:42:17,688 --> 00:42:18,720
Hey, guys!

709
00:42:36,773 --> 00:42:38,608
It's Alpha Trion!

710
00:42:39,336 --> 00:42:40,709
He's powered down.

711
00:42:41,536 --> 00:42:44,372
But his spark is still lit.

712
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:04,766
Quintesson ambush!

713
00:43:04,766 --> 00:43:06,361
Attack!

714
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:10,596
Message before--

715
00:43:10,596 --> 00:43:12,807
Whoa, whoa, it's okay!
It's okay.

716
00:43:13,403 --> 00:43:14,644
You're safe now.

717
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,371
The war is over.

718
00:43:37,933 --> 00:43:40,362
I failed you, old friend.

719
00:43:41,431 --> 00:43:45,367
You deserved
so much better than this end.

720
00:43:45,367 --> 00:43:47,974
No, you didn't fail.

721
00:43:47,974 --> 00:43:50,812
We heard your message.
We've come to find
the Matrix.

722
00:43:50,812 --> 00:43:54,013
Your transformation cogs.
What happened to you?

723
00:43:54,609 --> 00:43:55,916
Who are you?

724
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:58,281
We're cogless miners,
from Iacon.

725
00:43:58,281 --> 00:44:01,383
Miners? Why?

726
00:44:01,383 --> 00:44:02,824
Well, we've had
to drill for Energon

727
00:44:02,824 --> 00:44:04,958
ever since
it stopped flowing.

728
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:06,256
Impossible.

729
00:44:06,256 --> 00:44:08,489
That's why we came.
To fix things.

730
00:44:08,489 --> 00:44:10,557
If we find
the Matrix of Leadership

731
00:44:10,557 --> 00:44:12,295
and get it to Sentinel Prime,
he can fix--

732
00:44:12,295 --> 00:44:15,672
Sentinel is no Prime.

733
00:44:17,038 --> 00:44:19,434
What?
He's broken.
Fantastic.

734
00:44:19,434 --> 00:44:21,271
What are you talking about?
Why would you say that?

735
00:44:21,271 --> 00:44:23,174
Sentinel Prime
is our protector.

736
00:44:23,174 --> 00:44:25,308
He's been saving us from
the Quintessons ever since--

737
00:44:25,308 --> 00:44:29,279
You have not been saved.
You've been living a lie.

738
00:44:29,279 --> 00:44:32,282
I saw the truth
with my own eyes.

739
00:44:32,282 --> 00:44:35,417
Come. I will show you.

740
00:44:41,392 --> 00:44:44,899
For thousands of cycles,
the war with the Quintessons

741
00:44:44,899 --> 00:44:48,001
had been a brutal conflict.

742
00:44:52,238 --> 00:44:56,207
<i>Until Sentinel,
the principal aide
to the Primes,</i>

743
00:44:56,207 --> 00:44:59,210
<i>intercepted an enemy transmission.</i>

744
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:04,116
<i>There was going to be
a secret gathering
of Quintesson commanders.</i>

745
00:45:04,116 --> 00:45:06,888
<i>Their elimination
could end the war.</i>

746
00:45:06,888 --> 00:45:13,059
It was a mission so important,
we Primes took it on ourselves.

747
00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:17,327
We agreed to meet Sentinel for
his sensitive intel in secret,

748
00:45:17,327 --> 00:45:19,967
here in this cave.

749
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,727
But we were not alone.

750
00:45:24,037 --> 00:45:25,566
Quintessons!
They're here!

751
00:45:25,566 --> 00:45:27,073
It's a trap!
Battle positions!

752
00:45:27,073 --> 00:45:29,537
Hold the line!
Primus be with us!

753
00:45:32,377 --> 00:45:34,641
For Cybertron!

754
00:45:41,221 --> 00:45:43,353
<i>We were outnumbered,
but stood as one.</i>

755
00:45:45,621 --> 00:45:47,588
<i>Our victory was near.</i>

756
00:45:51,198 --> 00:45:53,066
<i>Until we were betrayed.</i>

757
00:46:17,893 --> 00:46:20,555
Sentinel, why?

758
00:46:20,555 --> 00:46:23,096
For all the power
of Cybertron.

759
00:46:26,332 --> 00:46:32,666
<i>But Sentinel never
understood the true power
of what he desired.</i>

760
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:36,736
<i>The Matrix of Leadership
can only be wielded</i>

761
00:46:36,736 --> 00:46:41,708
<i>by one that Primus himself
deems worthy.</i>

762
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:47,417
<i>And Sentinel
most certainly was not.</i>

763
00:46:47,417 --> 00:46:49,485
No!

764
00:46:52,457 --> 00:46:58,791
Wait. Hold on. You're saying
that the Matrix of Leadership
just vanished?

765
00:46:58,791 --> 00:47:00,463
No.

766
00:47:00,463 --> 00:47:02,872
No, no, no. That is impossible.
I don't believe it.

767
00:47:02,872 --> 00:47:04,731
Why would Sentinel
do that?

768
00:47:04,731 --> 00:47:06,337
To make a bargain.

769
00:47:06,337 --> 00:47:08,273
A bargain? With who?

770
00:47:11,012 --> 00:47:14,510
With the new rulers
of Cybertron.

771
00:47:19,649 --> 00:47:21,484
The Quintessons.

772
00:47:21,484 --> 00:47:22,716
There are so many.

773
00:47:44,839 --> 00:47:46,047
He's here.

774
00:47:46,984 --> 00:47:49,281
Sentinel Prime is here.

775
00:48:22,382 --> 00:48:25,416
Keep your eyes open.
They always are.

776
00:49:06,459 --> 00:49:07,997
I load those crates.

777
00:49:07,997 --> 00:49:10,428
Those are filled
with contaminated metal.

778
00:49:10,428 --> 00:49:12,133
I don't understand.

779
00:49:12,133 --> 00:49:14,762
What do the Quintessons
want with toxic waste?

780
00:49:19,307 --> 00:49:21,109
Our Energon.

781
00:49:28,052 --> 00:49:29,315
Traitor!
D, no.

782
00:49:41,956 --> 00:49:44,495
I know what
I promised you

783
00:49:44,495 --> 00:49:47,630
but our mines,
they're running out!

784
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:49,830
There's barely
enough Energon for us.

785
00:49:52,404 --> 00:49:54,637
I swear I will
get you the rest.

786
00:50:00,348 --> 00:50:02,183
Triple-time
every mining shift.

787
00:50:02,183 --> 00:50:04,878
No miner gets a break
until I get my Energon.

788
00:50:04,878 --> 00:50:06,550
All of it! Let's go.

789
00:50:22,799 --> 00:50:26,405
Now you have seen the truth.

790
00:50:29,872 --> 00:50:31,344
Every day...

791
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:37,944
Every single day
of my life

792
00:50:37,944 --> 00:50:40,518
has been a lie.

793
00:50:41,356 --> 00:50:43,015
My God, I knew it!

794
00:50:43,015 --> 00:50:45,886
Deep down,
I always felt
something was off.

795
00:50:45,886 --> 00:50:48,394
He deceived everyone.

796
00:50:48,394 --> 00:50:53,564
Sentinel bought himself power
and then put us to work
paying off his debt.

797
00:50:53,564 --> 00:50:55,335
I can't believe it.

798
00:50:55,335 --> 00:50:56,864
Well, obviously,
I can believe it,

799
00:50:56,864 --> 00:50:58,701
I just saw it,
but I still...

800
00:50:58,701 --> 00:51:00,736
I can't believe it.

801
00:51:00,736 --> 00:51:03,739
Sentinel lied

802
00:51:03,739 --> 00:51:05,873
to my face.
It was all a sham.

803
00:51:05,873 --> 00:51:08,711
How could we
have been so gullible?

804
00:51:08,711 --> 00:51:12,352
Oh, this-- this is going
to change everything.

805
00:51:17,051 --> 00:51:19,359
You just had to do it,
didn't you?

806
00:51:19,955 --> 00:51:21,691
Me? What did I do?

807
00:51:21,691 --> 00:51:23,528
You just had
to go to the surface,

808
00:51:23,528 --> 00:51:25,563
had to enter the Iacon 5000.

809
00:51:25,563 --> 00:51:28,137
You just had to break protocol!

810
00:51:28,137 --> 00:51:30,403
Who cares about protocol?
I do!

811
00:51:30,966 --> 00:51:32,570
I care!

812
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:35,210
Because nothing bad happens
when you stay on protocol!

813
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:36,706
Sentinel Prime
has been forcing us

814
00:51:36,706 --> 00:51:39,071
to work in the mines
until our gears strip,

815
00:51:39,071 --> 00:51:42,778
and all the while he's been
giving the Energon away
to our greatest enemies!

816
00:51:42,778 --> 00:51:45,781
And what do you think
he's going to do to us
when he finds out that we know?

817
00:51:45,781 --> 00:51:47,882
I'm not thinking about
what he's going to do,

818
00:51:47,882 --> 00:51:49,554
I'm thinking about
what we're going to do.

819
00:51:49,554 --> 00:51:51,325
That's the whole thing!

820
00:51:51,325 --> 00:51:53,723
You're never thinking about
anything else, just yourself!

821
00:51:53,723 --> 00:51:58,057
Fantastic!
Another Orion Pax master plan.
I can't wait to hear this.

822
00:51:58,057 --> 00:51:59,432
Don't you want
to stop him?

823
00:51:59,432 --> 00:52:01,335
No, I want to kill him!

824
00:52:02,602 --> 00:52:04,272
I want to put Sentinel in chains

825
00:52:04,272 --> 00:52:05,933
and march him
through the mines

826
00:52:05,933 --> 00:52:09,475
so everyone can see him
for the false Prime that he is!

827
00:52:09,475 --> 00:52:13,413
I want him to suffer
and then to die in darkness.

828
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,108
But we all know
that it doesn't matter

829
00:52:16,108 --> 00:52:17,747
what I want, right, Pax?

830
00:52:17,747 --> 00:52:21,355
The fact is,
we're just cogless bots. Right?

831
00:52:23,018 --> 00:52:28,197
We had limited options,
and now... now we have none.

832
00:52:29,497 --> 00:52:34,467
No son or daughter of Cybertron
is born without a cog.

833
00:52:34,467 --> 00:52:37,404
Oh, yeah.
I've been with myself
since I came online,

834
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:40,374
and this slot's
always been empty.

835
00:52:40,374 --> 00:52:42,409
What are you saying?
Are you saying--

836
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:46,006
No. No way.
Nobody could be that evil,
not even Sentinel.

837
00:52:46,006 --> 00:52:50,450
He removed your cogs
before you came online.

838
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:55,653
We were born with
transformation cogs,
but he...

839
00:52:55,653 --> 00:52:57,622
He took them from us.

840
00:52:57,622 --> 00:53:00,856
What defines a Transformer...

841
00:53:00,856 --> 00:53:03,331
...is not the cog
in his chest

842
00:53:03,331 --> 00:53:08,369
but the spark
that resides in their core.

843
00:53:08,369 --> 00:53:13,704
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

844
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:18,203
My fellow Primes had that spark.

845
00:53:18,203 --> 00:53:22,251
And I see their strength
in you.

846
00:53:23,815 --> 00:53:30,325
Take their cogs
and access
your full potential.

847
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,459
Prima.

848
00:53:33,924 --> 00:53:34,989
Onyx.

849
00:53:35,596 --> 00:53:37,123
Alchemist.

850
00:53:37,895 --> 00:53:39,334
Micronus.

851
00:53:39,334 --> 00:53:45,164
Warriors of noble spirit,
loyalty, strength.

852
00:53:45,164 --> 00:53:49,168
Their uniqueness
enhanced by these.

853
00:54:16,032 --> 00:54:20,441
They were one. You are one.

854
00:54:20,441 --> 00:54:23,312
All are one!

855
00:54:36,492 --> 00:54:39,955
Wait. We have...
You-- You gave us...

856
00:54:39,955 --> 00:54:43,464
The ability
to change your world.

857
00:54:43,464 --> 00:54:48,634
How you choose
to use that power
is up to you.

858
00:54:53,573 --> 00:54:54,904
They've found us.

859
00:54:54,904 --> 00:54:57,610
Oh, yes!
Time to fight back!

860
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:01,482
No. You must return to
Iacon City and alert everyone.

861
00:55:04,685 --> 00:55:07,983
Embedded in this
are the records
I have shown you.

862
00:55:07,983 --> 00:55:10,458
Use it to reveal the truth.

863
00:55:11,626 --> 00:55:12,823
We will.

864
00:55:12,823 --> 00:55:14,957
This tunnel leads
to the mountains.

865
00:55:14,957 --> 00:55:17,828
Cybertron's future
is in your hands.

866
00:55:17,828 --> 00:55:19,324
We're out of time.

867
00:55:19,324 --> 00:55:20,963
We got to move!

868
00:55:20,963 --> 00:55:23,735
Wait, we can't just
leave you here.

869
00:55:23,735 --> 00:55:26,298
Your fight will come,
my friend.

870
00:55:26,298 --> 00:55:29,675
Primus has a purpose
for us all.

871
00:55:29,675 --> 00:55:31,611
But this fight...

872
00:55:31,611 --> 00:55:33,514
This fight is mine.

873
00:55:33,514 --> 00:55:36,011
Now go!

874
00:55:47,024 --> 00:55:48,430
Stand down, old timer.

875
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:51,433
Ah. Old, you say?

876
00:56:21,256 --> 00:56:23,223
Not too old for you.

877
00:56:29,066 --> 00:56:30,230
We need to hurry!

878
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:31,935
I still think
we have better odds

879
00:56:31,935 --> 00:56:33,706
fighting than outrunning them.

880
00:56:33,706 --> 00:56:36,742
Wait! We have cogs.
We can transform now.

881
00:56:36,742 --> 00:56:39,712
That's right.
Everyone ready?
I was born ready.

882
00:56:39,712 --> 00:56:41,373
On three. One--

883
00:56:49,955 --> 00:56:50,855
Ah!

884
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,192
How do we use these things?

885
00:56:58,192 --> 00:57:00,128
I don't know. Just try.

886
00:57:02,031 --> 00:57:04,704
It's working. Ha! It's working!

887
00:57:05,465 --> 00:57:06,541
My head! My head!

888
00:57:06,541 --> 00:57:07,608
Whoa!

889
00:57:07,608 --> 00:57:09,445
Help! Help!

890
00:57:14,111 --> 00:57:16,650
This is not faster!

891
00:57:19,785 --> 00:57:21,556
Oh, come on!

892
00:57:21,556 --> 00:57:24,658
And transform!

893
00:57:26,957 --> 00:57:28,695
Wheels! I need wheels!

894
00:57:38,498 --> 00:57:39,398
Whoa.

895
00:58:00,124 --> 00:58:02,663
Ha!

896
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,129
Oh, wow.

897
00:58:07,129 --> 00:58:08,669
We're alive!
I've never moved that fast.

898
00:58:08,669 --> 00:58:11,463
That was incredible!
Did you see me slide all over?

899
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:19,911
Yes!

900
00:58:22,947 --> 00:58:24,509
Hey, whoa, buddy.
You okay?

901
00:58:24,509 --> 00:58:28,183
I'm great. Are you kidding me?
We can transform!

902
00:58:28,183 --> 00:58:30,350
We transform!

903
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:31,989
Oh, hey! I know.

904
00:58:31,989 --> 00:58:34,090
We're wasting time.
We have to get back to Iacon.

905
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:35,289
Looks like the fastest way

906
00:58:35,289 --> 00:58:37,027
back to Iacon is--
Here, I got it.

907
00:58:37,027 --> 00:58:38,523
Hey, what are you doing?

908
00:58:38,523 --> 00:58:40,228
Don't worry, I got it.
Yeah, but be careful.

909
00:58:40,228 --> 00:58:43,066
Our proof is inside and
you're spilling it everywhere.

910
00:58:44,366 --> 00:58:49,743
I... got... it.

911
00:58:51,747 --> 00:58:53,010
Okay.

912
00:58:56,917 --> 00:58:58,279
Follow me.

913
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,387
Alpha Trion!

914
00:59:07,387 --> 00:59:10,225
You are still alive.
Would you look at that?

915
00:59:11,096 --> 00:59:13,030
You look horrible.

916
00:59:13,802 --> 00:59:18,167
Traitor.
You are a disgrace.

917
00:59:18,167 --> 00:59:21,434
Primus will surely--
Uh-huh. Yes. Shut up.

918
00:59:21,434 --> 00:59:25,240
I seized an opportunity
to take control of my future.

919
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,714
Anything to get
out of working for you

920
00:59:26,714 --> 00:59:29,079
and that boring
council of elders.

921
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:31,279
Seriously,
I would watch you Primes

922
00:59:31,279 --> 00:59:33,413
spend half the day
losing a war

923
00:59:33,413 --> 00:59:38,253
and the other half
sitting around waxing poetic
about loyalty and honor.

924
00:59:38,253 --> 00:59:39,551
And now look at you.

925
00:59:39,551 --> 00:59:43,390
Hear my words:
You will fall.

926
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:45,458
And a new Prime will rise--

927
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:46,998
There you go again.

928
00:59:46,998 --> 00:59:49,935
I don't want to listen
to any more speeches.

929
00:59:51,266 --> 00:59:52,740
There were others
in the cave with you.

930
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:53,807
Who are they?

931
00:59:53,807 --> 00:59:56,942
They are to be your undoing.

932
00:59:56,942 --> 01:00:01,375
You've lost, Sentinel.
Nothing you can do--

933
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:10,483
Oh, didn't I just say
no speeches?

934
01:00:10,483 --> 01:00:12,122
You heard me, right?

935
01:00:12,122 --> 01:00:14,553
This is what I'm talking about.
Unbelievable.

936
01:00:14,553 --> 01:00:17,457
All of them are like that.
So disrespectful.

937
01:00:19,063 --> 01:00:21,296
Okay. Hunt down the others.

938
01:00:21,296 --> 01:00:22,638
With pleasure.

939
01:00:39,283 --> 01:00:40,480
Hey, buddy.

940
01:00:41,153 --> 01:00:42,515
Oh. Hey.

941
01:00:44,189 --> 01:00:47,322
You've been a little quiet.
Are you all right?

942
01:00:47,322 --> 01:00:51,656
All I can think about
is Sentinel's smirking face.

943
01:00:51,656 --> 01:00:55,495
He must pay for what he's done.
Someone has to do something.

944
01:00:55,495 --> 01:00:59,708
We are. With Alpha's proof
inside that device,
we will show everyone the truth.

945
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:02,810
You honestly believe
it'll be that easy?

946
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:04,812
Iacon doesn't want
to hear the truth.

947
01:01:04,812 --> 01:01:07,078
They worship Sentinel.

948
01:01:07,078 --> 01:01:09,113
There's got to be
a better way
to bring him down.

949
01:01:09,113 --> 01:01:11,819
We have to trust everyone will
believe what we show them.

950
01:01:11,819 --> 01:01:13,920
I trusted Sentinel!

951
01:01:14,516 --> 01:01:15,614
With everything.

952
01:01:16,793 --> 01:01:22,093
I will never trust
a so-called leader ever again.

953
01:01:24,691 --> 01:01:26,427
There's only one bot
I know I can trust--

954
01:01:37,077 --> 01:01:39,275
All right,
wake them up.

955
01:02:02,201 --> 01:02:05,466
Now, are you spies

956
01:02:06,601 --> 01:02:09,778
or just incompetent lackeys?

957
01:02:09,778 --> 01:02:12,605
We're not spies.
But he is incompetent.

958
01:02:12,605 --> 01:02:16,950
Scanning electrical impulses.
He speaks the truth.

959
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:21,515
That just means
he believes himself,
like any spy would.

960
01:02:23,517 --> 01:02:26,058
Uh, why is he gagged?

961
01:02:26,058 --> 01:02:27,752
He wouldn't stop talking.

962
01:02:27,752 --> 01:02:29,292
Even when he was
unconscious?

963
01:02:29,292 --> 01:02:31,525
Especially when
he was unconscious!

964
01:02:31,525 --> 01:02:32,768
Enough!

965
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:35,364
Two options for you!

966
01:02:35,364 --> 01:02:40,072
One, we slowly
dismantle each of you
one bolt and screw at a time,

967
01:02:40,072 --> 01:02:42,734
and really make sure
you feel it.

968
01:02:42,734 --> 01:02:43,878
Or two:

969
01:02:43,878 --> 01:02:45,671
In exchange
for a quick death,

970
01:02:45,671 --> 01:02:48,113
you give us intel
on the Energon trains,

971
01:02:48,113 --> 01:02:50,115
access to the mines

972
01:02:50,115 --> 01:02:53,822
or anything else that could
hurt your boss, Sentinel Prime.

973
01:02:53,822 --> 01:02:55,351
Who exactly are you guys?

974
01:02:57,056 --> 01:02:58,123
Ah!

975
01:02:58,123 --> 01:03:01,192
The Cybertronian High Guard!

976
01:03:01,192 --> 01:03:03,095
I told you
it wasn't tight enough!

977
01:03:03,095 --> 01:03:06,230
Prestigious defenders
of Iacon.
Prestigious?

978
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:08,969
He's right.
I read all about you
in the archives.

979
01:03:08,969 --> 01:03:12,401
You were
the most legendary warriors
in all of Cybertron.

980
01:03:12,401 --> 01:03:14,205
Look, look, look!
That's Starscream,

981
01:03:14,205 --> 01:03:17,109
and you're Shockwave,
and Soundwave.

982
01:03:17,109 --> 01:03:19,738
Raise your hand
if "wave" is in your name.
There's a lot of "waves."

983
01:03:19,738 --> 01:03:21,311
Silence!

984
01:03:21,311 --> 01:03:23,445
The yellow annoying one
is correct.

985
01:03:23,445 --> 01:03:24,446
Whoo!

986
01:03:24,446 --> 01:03:26,283
We were once the High Guard.

987
01:03:26,283 --> 01:03:30,023
We witnessed
Sentinel's betrayal,
saw the Primes fall.

988
01:03:30,023 --> 01:03:32,927
Since that day, we've been
fighting from the shadows,

989
01:03:32,927 --> 01:03:35,655
doing whatever we can
to sabotage Sentinel.

990
01:03:35,655 --> 01:03:37,393
That's great! We're--
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

991
01:03:37,393 --> 01:03:41,100
Okay, okay.
We're good.
Everyone relax.

992
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,597
I'm just saying we're allies.

993
01:03:43,597 --> 01:03:45,665
We were on our way
back to Iacon,

994
01:03:45,665 --> 01:03:49,735
and now with your help,
we can unify Cybertron
against Sentinel Prime.

995
01:03:49,735 --> 01:03:53,882
The idea of a unified
Cybertron is a myth.

996
01:03:53,882 --> 01:03:58,744
All that counts is the strength
of one bot over another!

997
01:04:00,713 --> 01:04:03,617
Okay. So, these guys
are a little intense.

998
01:04:03,617 --> 01:04:05,553
Yeah. Just a little.

999
01:04:05,553 --> 01:04:06,928
Hey!

1000
01:04:06,928 --> 01:04:08,490
What are you doing?

1001
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:13,726
I tell you
what I'm not doing.

1002
01:04:13,726 --> 01:04:17,664
I'm not cowering
in some busted ship,
playing king of the throne.

1003
01:04:17,664 --> 01:04:19,864
I'm not pretending
like I'm making a difference

1004
01:04:19,864 --> 01:04:22,603
by throwing one punch
and then running away to hide!

1005
01:04:22,603 --> 01:04:24,869
I found out
that Sentinel is rotten today,

1006
01:04:24,869 --> 01:04:26,871
and I'm gonna
make him pay for it.

1007
01:04:26,871 --> 01:04:28,378
Today!

1008
01:04:28,378 --> 01:04:31,986
You think you can insult me
and just walk away?

1009
01:04:31,986 --> 01:04:36,023
No one leaves here
unless I say so.

1010
01:04:36,023 --> 01:04:37,684
Is that right?

1011
01:04:38,687 --> 01:04:40,852
Well, how can you say so

1012
01:04:40,852 --> 01:04:42,821
with my head in your teeth?

1013
01:04:42,821 --> 01:04:44,493
D!

1014
01:04:51,403 --> 01:04:52,435
Whoa!

1015
01:04:57,574 --> 01:04:58,903
Hit me!

1016
01:04:58,903 --> 01:05:02,181
Do it! Come on! Yeah, more!

1017
01:05:02,181 --> 01:05:05,712
D-16! D-16! D-16!

1018
01:05:07,914 --> 01:05:12,884
You want to see the strength
of one bot over another? Huh?

1019
01:05:12,884 --> 01:05:14,963
Is that
all you've got, tough bot?

1020
01:05:14,963 --> 01:05:17,757
Let's go! Do it! Come on!

1021
01:05:35,414 --> 01:05:37,480
Please! I beg you!

1022
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:40,318
Stop!
D, he's not the enemy!

1023
01:05:42,652 --> 01:05:44,784
Bear witness!

1024
01:05:44,784 --> 01:05:47,589
This is the last time
I show mercy!

1025
01:05:47,589 --> 01:05:50,262
Decide right now:

1026
01:05:50,262 --> 01:05:54,893
You can stay here in hiding,
bowing before
your pathetic leader,

1027
01:05:54,893 --> 01:05:58,237
or follow me
as we march on Iacon

1028
01:05:58,237 --> 01:06:01,801
and I take down Sentinel
once and for all!

1029
01:06:04,276 --> 01:06:08,874
D-16! D-16! D-16!

1030
01:06:35,738 --> 01:06:36,968
B, come on!

1031
01:07:01,995 --> 01:07:04,765
Engage all hostiles!
I've got the bridge!

1032
01:07:36,535 --> 01:07:37,435
Elita, get down!

1033
01:08:00,053 --> 01:08:02,691
I feel like someone
dropped a cliff on me.

1034
01:08:02,691 --> 01:08:05,232
Where are the others?

1035
01:08:05,232 --> 01:08:09,027
Sentinel's troops
took as many prisoners
as they could carry.

1036
01:08:09,027 --> 01:08:10,831
They got D-16 and B.

1037
01:08:10,831 --> 01:08:12,701
Oh, no.

1038
01:08:12,701 --> 01:08:15,275
And half of those
High-Guard nutjobs.

1039
01:08:17,277 --> 01:08:19,004
Our proof.

1040
01:08:19,004 --> 01:08:20,445
It's gone.

1041
01:08:21,316 --> 01:08:23,580
So, what do we do now?

1042
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:25,186
D was right.

1043
01:08:25,186 --> 01:08:27,782
About what?
Everything.

1044
01:08:27,782 --> 01:08:31,423
Look at it. Look around.
This is a disaster.

1045
01:08:31,986 --> 01:08:33,161
It's all my fault.

1046
01:08:33,161 --> 01:08:35,086
I should have
stayed on protocol.

1047
01:08:41,369 --> 01:08:44,766
Listen to me.
I really want you to hear this.

1048
01:08:44,766 --> 01:08:45,833
Are you listening?

1049
01:08:48,442 --> 01:08:49,837
I'm better than you.

1050
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,477
Yeah, okay,
I'm hearing you.

1051
01:08:53,348 --> 01:08:55,106
I'm better than you
in every way,

1052
01:08:55,106 --> 01:08:57,614
except you have hope.

1053
01:08:57,614 --> 01:09:01,321
You always have. You went back
into the mine to rescue Jazz.

1054
01:09:01,321 --> 01:09:05,292
You snuck up
to the surface to find
the Matrix of Leadership.

1055
01:09:05,292 --> 01:09:07,118
Yeah,
and how'd that work out?

1056
01:09:07,118 --> 01:09:08,889
My point is,

1057
01:09:08,889 --> 01:09:13,157
that your instincts tell you
to break protocol for a reason.

1058
01:09:13,157 --> 01:09:16,270
This blind optimism
that you have

1059
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:20,637
is why you make such bold
and courageous choices,

1060
01:09:21,706 --> 01:09:23,508
that are also extremely stupid.

1061
01:09:23,508 --> 01:09:26,071
First time
giving a pep talk?

1062
01:09:26,071 --> 01:09:27,842
You're inspiring.

1063
01:09:27,842 --> 01:09:31,219
You can envision a better future
that no one else can see.

1064
01:09:32,288 --> 01:09:35,322
And if we ever want to see
B and D-16 again,

1065
01:09:35,322 --> 01:09:39,359
that is the Orion Pax
that we need right now.

1066
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,592
Listen to me.

1067
01:09:42,496 --> 01:09:43,693
We can do this.

1068
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:49,369
Those Energon trains
will be heading
back to Iacon.

1069
01:09:49,369 --> 01:09:52,097
If we intercepted one--

1070
01:09:52,097 --> 01:09:55,309
Hell yes, I can reroute it.
What else do we need?

1071
01:09:55,309 --> 01:10:00,039
Well, my bold instincts tell me
we have to recruit some nutjobs.

1072
01:10:02,076 --> 01:10:04,384
I was afraid
you'd say that.

1073
01:10:04,384 --> 01:10:07,981
Uh, Shockwave, Soundwave.
You in the back.

1074
01:10:07,981 --> 01:10:11,259
In order to save
our captured friends,
we have to act now.

1075
01:10:11,259 --> 01:10:13,558
How about I blast you
back to Iacon?

1076
01:10:13,558 --> 01:10:16,990
Oh! She punched me in my eye!

1077
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:20,235
Everyone, shut up!
All of you. Listen to him.

1078
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:24,063
Most likely, our friends
are being held captive

1079
01:10:24,063 --> 01:10:25,735
at the top
of Sentinel's tower.

1080
01:10:25,735 --> 01:10:28,771
A surprise attack would
give us a chance to rescue them.

1081
01:10:28,771 --> 01:10:33,743
Impossible. We do not
have enough soldiers
or a way inside.

1082
01:10:33,743 --> 01:10:36,911
Elita will get us in.
And I will get more troops.

1083
01:10:36,911 --> 01:10:38,550
Why should we follow you?

1084
01:10:39,718 --> 01:10:41,388
We will follow you.

1085
01:10:41,388 --> 01:10:44,622
Attention, High Guard.
Prepare for battle.

1086
01:10:44,622 --> 01:10:46,657
What is our first move?

1087
01:10:46,657 --> 01:10:47,823
We roll out.

1088
01:10:49,398 --> 01:10:50,430
What?

1089
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:51,860
Louder.

1090
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:54,302
Transform and roll out!

1091
01:11:04,204 --> 01:11:07,843
I don't understand.
Why are we still alive?

1092
01:11:07,843 --> 01:11:11,451
Look at this rowdy bunch!
The High Guard!

1093
01:11:11,451 --> 01:11:13,321
You know, you guys
have been tough to find.

1094
01:11:13,321 --> 01:11:16,918
Every trip to the surface,
I've been searching for you.

1095
01:11:16,918 --> 01:11:19,459
Tracking the bots in the cave
led me right to them.

1096
01:11:19,459 --> 01:11:20,790
Oh-ho-ho!

1097
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:23,727
You captured Starscream!
It was too easy.

1098
01:11:23,727 --> 01:11:25,927
I'm going to rip you apart
piece by piece

1099
01:11:25,927 --> 01:11:27,434
so that your death
is painful!

1100
01:11:27,434 --> 01:11:28,732
You'll regret
the day you were--

1101
01:11:28,732 --> 01:11:30,701
You sound ridiculous.
It's weird.

1102
01:11:30,701 --> 01:11:33,737
Oh, D-16,
what a tragic story you'll be.

1103
01:11:33,737 --> 01:11:37,642
Atop the leaderboard
in your sector
and secretly a traitor.

1104
01:11:37,642 --> 01:11:39,743
I'm not a traitor.
You're the traitor.

1105
01:11:39,743 --> 01:11:42,482
Nuh-uh. You, all of you,
are traitors.

1106
01:11:42,482 --> 01:11:46,178
You've been working
with the Quintessons
to sabotage my expeditions.

1107
01:11:46,178 --> 01:11:48,620
You're the reason
why I haven't found
the Matrix of Leadership yet.

1108
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:49,918
None of that is true!

1109
01:11:49,918 --> 01:11:51,524
Oh, trust me,
it'll be very true

1110
01:11:51,524 --> 01:11:54,461
when I'm executing you
in front of all of Iacon.

1111
01:11:54,461 --> 01:11:58,289
Because down here,
the truth is what I make it.

1112
01:12:07,036 --> 01:12:09,443
Well, well.
What's this about?

1113
01:12:10,303 --> 01:12:13,007
I'm not kneeling
in front of you.

1114
01:12:13,007 --> 01:12:14,976
Feeling confident, are we?

1115
01:12:14,976 --> 01:12:18,210
You don't scare me.
You want to know why?

1116
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:19,310
Please.

1117
01:12:20,522 --> 01:12:23,556
Because I don't have
anything left to lose.

1118
01:12:23,556 --> 01:12:25,723
You took it all.

1119
01:12:27,089 --> 01:12:28,462
I sure did.

1120
01:12:31,531 --> 01:12:33,929
Ah, Megatronus Prime.

1121
01:12:35,328 --> 01:12:38,406
Of course you were a fan.
Megatronus was
the coolest Prime!

1122
01:12:38,406 --> 01:12:41,299
The biggest!
The baddest! The toughest!

1123
01:12:42,544 --> 01:12:44,775
That's why,
after I killed him,

1124
01:12:45,811 --> 01:12:48,042
I took his cog for myself.

1125
01:12:48,042 --> 01:12:50,550
He was greater
than you'll ever be!

1126
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:52,849
I don't know. I'm pretty great.

1127
01:12:52,849 --> 01:12:55,720
But I can understand why you'd
want to wear his face over mine.

1128
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,787
Here.

1129
01:12:58,021 --> 01:13:01,253
Let's make sure
it doesn't come off.

1130
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:22,549
Okay.

1131
01:13:22,549 --> 01:13:25,112
I can do this.

1132
01:13:38,765 --> 01:13:42,261
You can't be serious.
We just worked
22 shifts without a break!

1133
01:13:42,261 --> 01:13:43,999
These miners need rest
and time to repair and--

1134
01:13:43,999 --> 01:13:46,298
Sentinel Prime
wants more Energon.

1135
01:13:46,298 --> 01:13:49,741
So get back in the mines
before I make you
get back in the--

1136
01:13:55,406 --> 01:13:57,408
Who was that?
Did you see
who that was?

1137
01:13:57,408 --> 01:13:58,618
That can't be him.

1138
01:13:58,618 --> 01:13:59,718
Is that...

1139
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:02,413
It can't be.

1140
01:14:02,413 --> 01:14:04,954
Orion?
Jazz.

1141
01:14:04,954 --> 01:14:06,384
Is it really you?

1142
01:14:06,384 --> 01:14:08,793
Yeah, I know I, uh,
look a little different.

1143
01:14:08,793 --> 01:14:10,388
"Little"?

1144
01:14:10,388 --> 01:14:12,225
There's nothing
"little" about you.

1145
01:14:12,225 --> 01:14:14,095
Uh, how is this possible?

1146
01:14:14,095 --> 01:14:16,933
Sentinel told us you died
from your race injuries.

1147
01:14:17,771 --> 01:14:19,903
Sentinel is a liar.

1148
01:14:19,903 --> 01:14:21,938
What?
Huh?

1149
01:14:21,938 --> 01:14:24,105
Look, I know how this will sound
coming from me.

1150
01:14:24,105 --> 01:14:27,614
I was never
the most focused miner.

1151
01:14:27,614 --> 01:14:30,078
But as you can see,
everything is different now.

1152
01:14:37,923 --> 01:14:42,156
I went to the surface
and I learned the truth.

1153
01:14:43,632 --> 01:14:45,291
My friends,

1154
01:14:45,291 --> 01:14:49,394
we were all born
with transformation cogs.

1155
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:53,607
And then Sentinel,
he stole them from us.

1156
01:14:53,607 --> 01:14:57,006
He took away our ability
to make our own decisions.

1157
01:14:57,006 --> 01:14:59,173
He stole our freedom.

1158
01:15:02,981 --> 01:15:08,820
But now, I'm offering you
your first real choice.

1159
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:12,956
You can work a 23rd shift
and mine yourself to death

1160
01:15:14,663 --> 01:15:17,488
or fight back
against Sentinel with me.

1161
01:15:18,029 --> 01:15:20,161
Right now.

1162
01:15:20,161 --> 01:15:23,538
How are we supposed to do that?
We can't fight.
We don't have cogs.

1163
01:15:25,872 --> 01:15:29,808
What defines a Transformer
is not the cog in its chest

1164
01:15:29,808 --> 01:15:32,778
but the spark
that resides in their core.

1165
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:36,947
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

1166
01:15:36,947 --> 01:15:40,819
And that spark,
Sentinel can never
take from us.

1167
01:15:40,819 --> 01:15:43,217
There's not enough of us.
We'd need an army.

1168
01:15:43,217 --> 01:15:46,990
And we have one.
Elita is bringing troops.

1169
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:49,058
We are not alone in this.

1170
01:15:49,058 --> 01:15:51,863
If we want to be in control
of our own destiny,

1171
01:15:51,863 --> 01:15:53,524
we will have to
fight for it.

1172
01:15:53,524 --> 01:15:56,901
Now is the time
for us to stand up...

1173
01:15:56,901 --> 01:15:58,903
...for ourselves.

1174
01:16:01,237 --> 01:16:03,171
Stand up for this injustice.

1175
01:16:05,371 --> 01:16:09,078
I promise you
this fight will be worth it.

1176
01:16:10,015 --> 01:16:11,751
Follow me.

1177
01:16:11,751 --> 01:16:14,655
Nothing can stop us
when we stand together.

1178
01:16:14,655 --> 01:16:18,186
Together as one.

1179
01:16:18,186 --> 01:16:22,696
Orion Pax! Orion Pax! Orion Pax!

1180
01:16:22,696 --> 01:16:25,193
<i>Elita, it's time.</i>

1181
01:16:25,193 --> 01:16:26,524
You got it.

1182
01:16:26,524 --> 01:16:28,801
Buckle up, Blinky.
We're going in.

1183
01:16:42,212 --> 01:16:43,442
Not a good idea.

1184
01:16:45,611 --> 01:16:47,787
D, stay down.

1185
01:16:59,592 --> 01:17:01,427
Well, that's a shame.

1186
01:17:01,427 --> 01:17:03,396
You really were
a great miner.

1187
01:17:07,908 --> 01:17:10,337
We've got a breach!
Protect Sentinel!

1188
01:17:19,579 --> 01:17:22,151
They spotted us.
It's about to get bumpy.

1189
01:17:23,088 --> 01:17:24,791
High Guard, eject.

1190
01:17:24,791 --> 01:17:26,760
Come on! Move out!

1191
01:17:41,634 --> 01:17:43,777
There's too many.
We have to abort!

1192
01:17:49,411 --> 01:17:50,476
We're not gonna make it.

1193
01:17:53,349 --> 01:17:54,315
Whoo-hoo!

1194
01:17:54,315 --> 01:17:55,921
Metal to the pedal, miners!

1195
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:57,681
Let's break some protocol!

1196
01:17:57,681 --> 01:17:59,452
That's what
I'm talking about, Pax!

1197
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,365
Whoa! That's intense.

1198
01:18:11,365 --> 01:18:16,073
You can't win, miner.
I see everything!

1199
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:18,977
That's right, you do.

1200
01:18:18,977 --> 01:18:21,716
Except the tower we're
about to crash into.

1201
01:18:34,687 --> 01:18:36,357
What's going on?

1202
01:18:40,526 --> 01:18:41,736
Hey!

1203
01:18:47,205 --> 01:18:49,007
What has he done to you?

1204
01:18:49,007 --> 01:18:51,878
This is nothing compared to
what I'm gonna do to Sentinel.

1205
01:18:52,815 --> 01:18:55,079
Soundwave,
free the prisoners.

1206
01:18:59,745 --> 01:19:02,086
I know how to stop him.
Airachnid is the answer.

1207
01:19:02,086 --> 01:19:03,857
I'm doing this my way.
D!

1208
01:19:09,392 --> 01:19:10,424
Yes!

1209
01:19:10,424 --> 01:19:11,491
Whoa!

1210
01:19:11,491 --> 01:19:13,031
Whoa-ho-ho!

1211
01:19:13,031 --> 01:19:14,395
I got a battle mask!

1212
01:19:16,133 --> 01:19:18,069
Elita! Battle mask!

1213
01:19:18,069 --> 01:19:21,039
It appeared
when this guy tried to--

1214
01:19:21,039 --> 01:19:23,074
Knife hands?
I have knife hands!

1215
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:27,144
What the--?

1216
01:19:30,147 --> 01:19:31,951
Badassatron.

1217
01:19:37,255 --> 01:19:39,156
Where's Sentinel?

1218
01:19:41,864 --> 01:19:43,963
You pathetic little twits.

1219
01:19:43,963 --> 01:19:48,297
Did you really think
that you could knock down
everything I've built?

1220
01:19:48,297 --> 01:19:52,136
It's over, Sentinel.
You can't escape the truth.
What truth?

1221
01:19:52,136 --> 01:19:54,842
That I plucked the cogs
from your newborn chests?

1222
01:19:54,842 --> 01:19:57,042
Forced you to mine
so that I could pay off
the Quintessons

1223
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:58,406
and live like a king?

1224
01:19:58,406 --> 01:20:01,409
None of that matters!
Because the truth...

1225
01:20:01,409 --> 01:20:05,413
...is what I make it.

1226
01:20:07,615 --> 01:20:08,515
Incoming!

1227
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:11,683
Whoa!

1228
01:20:15,458 --> 01:20:17,095
He's too strong.
I have a plan.

1229
01:20:17,095 --> 01:20:19,295
We need Airachnid.
Airachnid?

1230
01:20:19,295 --> 01:20:21,561
We need her memory.
Where is she?

1231
01:20:21,561 --> 01:20:23,167
Found her!

1232
01:20:24,698 --> 01:20:25,664
Elita!

1233
01:20:26,535 --> 01:20:27,941
<i>Do not break her.</i>

1234
01:20:27,941 --> 01:20:29,272
<i>Bring her
to the broadcast station.</i>

1235
01:20:29,272 --> 01:20:30,504
<i>We'll meet you there.</i>

1236
01:20:30,504 --> 01:20:32,473
Easier said than done.

1237
01:20:51,527 --> 01:20:52,790
<i>I said,
don't break her!</i>

1238
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:55,826
Relax! I'm being very gentle.

1239
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:03,009
Orion! Orion, look!
I have knife hands!

1240
01:21:03,009 --> 01:21:04,604
I can see that.

1241
01:21:04,604 --> 01:21:06,804
I'm gonna cut these guys.
Watch. Come here!

1242
01:21:06,804 --> 01:21:08,674
You can jab them later.
We got to go.

1243
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:13,052
Yeah!

1244
01:21:32,335 --> 01:21:34,568
Uh, excuse me.
You can't be in here.

1245
01:21:41,841 --> 01:21:43,511
B!

1246
01:21:43,511 --> 01:21:46,349
These are not
the bad guys.
Why did you cut the door?

1247
01:21:46,349 --> 01:21:48,989
What? No, I didn't--
That was an-- I--

1248
01:21:48,989 --> 01:21:50,617
It was already like that.
Right?

1249
01:21:50,617 --> 01:21:51,959
Yes, that's right.
That's right, yes.

1250
01:21:51,959 --> 01:21:54,060
Yeah, it was already like--
Yes. Mm-hmm.

1251
01:21:58,726 --> 01:22:00,594
<i>Attention, Iacon City.</i>

1252
01:22:00,594 --> 01:22:03,971
<i>Stand by for
a live transmission
from Sentinel Prime.</i>

1253
01:22:09,770 --> 01:22:11,341
What's wrong, D-16?

1254
01:22:12,278 --> 01:22:13,442
Rise up!

1255
01:22:17,151 --> 01:22:19,085
<i>That's why after I killed him--</i>

1256
01:22:19,085 --> 01:22:23,221
<i>That's why after I killed him,
I took his cog for myself.</i>

1257
01:22:23,221 --> 01:22:25,553
<i>...cog for myself.</i>

1258
01:22:25,553 --> 01:22:29,392
<i>What truth?
That I plucked the cogs
from your newborn chests?</i>

1259
01:22:29,392 --> 01:22:31,097
<i>Forced you to mine
so that I could pay off</i>

1260
01:22:31,097 --> 01:22:32,956
<i>the Quintessons
and live like a king?</i>

1261
01:22:32,956 --> 01:22:34,661
<i>What truth?</i>

1262
01:22:34,661 --> 01:22:36,597
<i>That I plucked the cogs
from your newborn chests?</i>

1263
01:22:36,597 --> 01:22:38,302
<i>Forced you to mine
so that I could pay off</i>

1264
01:22:38,302 --> 01:22:40,469
<i>the Quintessons
and live like a king?</i>

1265
01:22:40,469 --> 01:22:42,306
<i>I'm working my miners
as hard as I can.</i>

1266
01:22:42,306 --> 01:22:45,276
<i>I swear I will
get you the rest!</i>

1267
01:22:45,276 --> 01:22:47,443
<i>I'm working my miners
as hard as I can.</i>

1268
01:22:47,443 --> 01:22:50,248
<i>I swear I will
get you the rest!</i>

1269
01:22:50,248 --> 01:22:52,613
<i>I'm working my miners
as hard as I can, I swear--</i>

1270
01:22:52,613 --> 01:22:54,252
Liar!

1271
01:22:57,015 --> 01:22:58,916
We trusted you!

1272
01:22:59,589 --> 01:23:00,621
Traitor!

1273
01:23:00,621 --> 01:23:02,689
Pax, we did it.

1274
01:23:14,307 --> 01:23:15,471
D!

1275
01:23:43,369 --> 01:23:44,401
D-16.

1276
01:23:45,239 --> 01:23:47,701
We can lead Cybertron together!

1277
01:23:47,701 --> 01:23:49,109
Don't do this!

1278
01:23:55,346 --> 01:23:56,512
What are you doing?

1279
01:23:56,512 --> 01:23:58,151
It's over, D.

1280
01:23:58,151 --> 01:24:00,318
Everyone in Iacon
knows the truth.

1281
01:24:00,318 --> 01:24:01,979
So do I!

1282
01:24:01,979 --> 01:24:05,158
He took everything from us!
I have to do this!

1283
01:24:05,158 --> 01:24:06,819
No, you don't.

1284
01:24:06,819 --> 01:24:10,526
Rebuilding Iacon
cannot begin
with an execution.

1285
01:24:10,526 --> 01:24:13,056
He deserves to die!
Can't you see that?

1286
01:24:13,056 --> 01:24:16,070
We're better than this.
Don't be like Sentinel.

1287
01:24:18,030 --> 01:24:19,733
Pax,

1288
01:24:19,733 --> 01:24:23,803
you need to move
out of my way
before I move you myself.

1289
01:24:23,803 --> 01:24:26,003
D, listen--

1290
01:24:34,112 --> 01:24:35,386
Stop!

1291
01:24:47,268 --> 01:24:48,366
No!

1292
01:24:48,366 --> 01:24:50,434
No, no, no, no. Why?

1293
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:53,866
Why did you do that? Why?

1294
01:25:03,282 --> 01:25:05,977
D, no.

1295
01:25:12,051 --> 01:25:13,523
I'm done saving you.

1296
01:26:53,427 --> 01:26:56,461
The Age of Primes has ended!

1297
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:58,826
No more false prophets!

1298
01:26:58,826 --> 01:27:03,094
Follow me and you will
never again be deceived.

1299
01:27:03,899 --> 01:27:06,438
Rise up!

1300
01:27:06,438 --> 01:27:08,506
Rise up! Rise up!

1301
01:27:08,506 --> 01:27:11,707
Rise up! Rise up!
Rise up!

1302
01:27:11,707 --> 01:27:14,072
<i>Orion Pax,</i>

1303
01:27:14,072 --> 01:27:17,207
<i>your noble sacrifice
for the greater good</i>

1304
01:27:17,207 --> 01:27:21,255
<i>has proven you worthy
in the eyes of Primus.</i>

1305
01:27:22,049 --> 01:27:24,522
<i>He entrusts in you</i>

1306
01:27:24,522 --> 01:27:27,426
the future of Cybertron

1307
01:27:27,426 --> 01:27:33,058
and the Matrix of Leadership!

1308
01:27:34,257 --> 01:27:37,667
I will lead us all
into the future!

1309
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:55,751
I...

1310
01:27:56,523 --> 01:27:57,588
am...

1311
01:27:58,459 --> 01:28:00,294
Megatron!

1312
01:28:00,989 --> 01:28:02,923
<i>Arise...</i>

1313
01:28:03,629 --> 01:28:06,058
<i>Optimus Prime.</i>

1314
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:10,931
Burn it down!

1315
01:28:11,604 --> 01:28:12,933
All of it!

1316
01:28:18,336 --> 01:28:21,513
All hail Megatron!

1317
01:28:23,418 --> 01:28:25,913
He's gonna kill everyone.
We have to stop him.
Come on.

1318
01:28:27,422 --> 01:28:29,114
Stop! It's over.

1319
01:28:29,114 --> 01:28:32,887
It's over when every last one
of his followers is dead!

1320
01:29:06,351 --> 01:29:07,823
Impossible.

1321
01:29:10,498 --> 01:29:14,357
Primus gave you the Matrix.

1322
01:29:14,357 --> 01:29:16,568
We could've built
the future together.

1323
01:29:16,568 --> 01:29:18,603
I'll build it myself.

1324
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:22,200
After I tear down
everyone in my way!

1325
01:30:03,782 --> 01:30:04,814
Ah!

1326
01:31:06,944 --> 01:31:10,143
We were given the power
to change our world

1327
01:31:10,143 --> 01:31:12,651
and you chose to destroy it.

1328
01:31:12,651 --> 01:31:14,114
Just like Sentinel.

1329
01:31:14,114 --> 01:31:17,986
You have betrayed Cybertron
and its citizens.

1330
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:22,452
And you betrayed me.

1331
01:31:33,531 --> 01:31:34,607
Go.

1332
01:31:35,467 --> 01:31:38,138
Take the High Guard
and leave.

1333
01:31:39,372 --> 01:31:42,978
You are banished from Iacon.

1334
01:31:47,853 --> 01:31:50,183
It didn't have to end
this way.

1335
01:31:52,517 --> 01:31:55,991
This isn't over, Prime.

1336
01:32:03,330 --> 01:32:05,902
High Guard, follow me!

1337
01:32:19,511 --> 01:32:22,050
<i>The line
between friend and enemy</i>

1338
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:25,218
<i>is not as clear
as I once believed.</i>

1339
01:32:25,218 --> 01:32:29,156
<i>Once it's crossed,
there's no going back.</i>

1340
01:32:29,156 --> 01:32:33,193
<i>Because some transformations
are permanent.</i>

1341
01:32:33,193 --> 01:32:35,063
Hey, Megatronus Prime.
Nice.

1342
01:32:35,063 --> 01:32:37,230
Oh, yeah.
Well, he's my hero.

1343
01:32:37,230 --> 01:32:39,067
The greatest Prime
to ever live.

1344
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:43,566
I'm D-16.
Orion Pax.

1345
01:32:43,566 --> 01:32:45,975
You ever mine Energon before?

1346
01:32:45,975 --> 01:32:47,372
No. You?

1347
01:32:47,372 --> 01:32:49,583
No. I hear it's dangerous.

1348
01:32:50,278 --> 01:32:51,684
Well, I'll tell you what.

1349
01:32:51,684 --> 01:32:54,214
You watch my back,
I promise to watch yours.

1350
01:32:54,214 --> 01:32:55,413
All right.

1351
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:58,251
Thanks, Pax.

1352
01:33:11,299 --> 01:33:13,596
A new beginning
for Cybertron.

1353
01:33:13,596 --> 01:33:15,708
And a new leader.

1354
01:33:15,708 --> 01:33:17,710
Yes, about that.

1355
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:22,715
I could use some help
from a bot who is
better than me in every way.

1356
01:33:22,715 --> 01:33:24,684
Who, me? Oh, no, no.

1357
01:33:24,684 --> 01:33:27,082
I have a pretty sweet gig
working in waste management.

1358
01:33:27,082 --> 01:33:30,085
Well, Captain,
I do owe you a promotion.

1359
01:33:30,085 --> 01:33:32,857
How's Major Elita sound?

1360
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:35,420
How about Commander?

1361
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:37,389
Even better.

1362
01:33:37,389 --> 01:33:41,360
And I'm sorry, B,
but I cannot let you
go back to sublevel 50.

1363
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,197
I may be a Prime now,

1364
01:33:43,197 --> 01:33:44,935
but I'm gonna need you
by my side.

1365
01:33:44,935 --> 01:33:48,433
Are you serious?
This is the greatest
day of my life.

1366
01:33:48,433 --> 01:33:50,633
I get to work
for the government.

1367
01:33:50,633 --> 01:33:54,274
Okay. So that's new.

1368
01:33:54,274 --> 01:33:55,946
I'm sorry,
what is happening?

1369
01:34:26,374 --> 01:34:30,112
<i>And now we stand here
together as one...</i>

1370
01:34:32,512 --> 01:34:35,645
<i>proving we all have
the power to transform,</i>

1371
01:34:35,645 --> 01:34:38,890
<i>to become
who we were destined to be,</i>

1372
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:43,587
<i>to right wrongs,
to make our world better.</i>

1373
01:34:43,587 --> 01:34:46,766
<i>Because here,
freedom and autonomy</i>

1374
01:34:46,766 --> 01:34:49,494
<i>are the rights
of all sentient beings.</i>

1375
01:34:50,596 --> 01:34:55,071
<i>Here,
all are truly Autobots.</i>

1376

<i>This message is a warning
to all Quintessons.</i>

1377
01:35:00,142 --> 01:35:05,543
<i>If you dare
return to Cybertron,
the Autobots will be waiting.</i>

1378
01:35:05,543 --> 01:35:08,480
<i>I will be waiting.</i>

1379
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:12,319
<i>I am Optimus Prime.</i>

1380
01:35:40,182 --> 01:35:42,679
Hey, guys! Great news,
the Energon's back!

1381
01:35:42,679 --> 01:35:44,956
And I have a cog
and I can transform!

1382
01:35:44,956 --> 01:35:46,892
It's a long story.
I'll fill you in later.

1383
01:35:46,892 --> 01:35:50,456
Oh! And here's the best part.
My hands are straight-up knives.

1384
01:35:50,456 --> 01:35:52,293
Watch this. Knife hands!

1385
01:35:54,198 --> 01:35:55,230
No!

1386
01:43:20,072 --> 01:43:23,975
<i>Sentinel the betrayer is dead.</i>

1387
01:43:23,975 --> 01:43:27,715
<i>But his death has given life
to a new enemy.</i>

1388
01:43:27,715 --> 01:43:29,915
<i>A stronger enemy.</i>

1389
01:43:29,915 --> 01:43:32,049
<i>A personal enemy.</i>

1390
01:43:33,184 --> 01:43:37,362
<i>We will not be blinded
by his deception.</i>

1391
01:43:37,362 --> 01:43:40,024
<i>We are the ones who are...</i>

1392
01:43:40,862 --> 01:43:42,862
Decepticons!

1393
01:43:42,862 --> 01:43:44,699
Rise up!

1394
01:43:44,699 --> 01:43:48,197
Rise up! Rise up!
