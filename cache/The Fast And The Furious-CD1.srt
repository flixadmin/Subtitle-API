to buy anything.

612
00:51:09,318 --> 00:51:11,179
[ Beeping ]
Oh.

613
00:51:12,615 --> 00:51:14,408
What,Jess ?

614
00:51:23,005 --> 00:51:24,969
Dom, we got a wolf pack.

615
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:29,031
[Jesse ]
lt's Johnny Tran, and he's
comin'your way really fast!

616
00:51:29,233 --> 00:51:30,664
All right,
we got company.

617
00:51:30,932 --> 00:51:32,624
Spilner!

618
00:51:57,275 --> 00:52:00,103
Come on.
Move !

619
00:52:00,306 --> 00:52:03,030
Let me ask you
a question, Ted.

620
00:52:04,269 --> 00:52:06,892
Do you see
anything wrong here ?

621
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,893
No.

622
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:13,722
- We got no engines, do we ?
- No!

623
00:52:13,928 --> 00:52:15,552
- Do we ?
- No!

624
00:52:15,759 --> 00:52:17,553
Do we ?
No !

625
00:52:17,758 --> 00:52:20,550
A couple of Nissan S.R.-Twenty
motors will pull a premium...

626
00:52:20,755 --> 00:52:24,048
one week before
Race Wars, huh ?
Yeah, probably.

627
00:52:24,252 --> 00:52:27,545
You're a smart fence, Ted.
Maybe too smart.

628
00:52:28,915 --> 00:52:31,037
What are you feelin',
Lance ?

629
00:52:32,278 --> 00:52:34,209
Forty weight ?

630
00:52:34,443 --> 00:52:36,203
Fifty weight ?

631
00:52:36,441 --> 00:52:38,235
A forty weight
sounds nice.

632
00:52:50,662 --> 00:52:52,888
[ Ted Grunts ]

633
00:52:53,093 --> 00:52:55,114
Where are they, Ted ?

634
00:52:55,325 --> 00:52:57,482
Where are they?
Enough !

635
00:52:57,689 --> 00:52:59,915
- Where are they ?
- They're in a warehouse.

636
00:53:00,087 --> 00:53:03,641
They're in
a warehouse, man!

637
00:53:03,883 --> 00:53:05,848
[ Groans ]

638
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:14,339
[ Coughing, Gagging ]

639
00:53:18,038 --> 00:53:19,468
Ted.

640
00:53:20,103 --> 00:53:22,396
Kiss my shoes ?

641
00:53:24,332 --> 00:53:26,387
[ Coughing ]

642
00:53:29,628 --> 00:53:31,921
[ Grunts ]

643
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:36,813
[Johnny ]
Let's go get our engines.

644
00:53:37,054 --> 00:53:39,915
My superiors
are flying in from D.C.
day after tomorrow.

645
00:53:40,118 --> 00:53:42,014
I want
something to show.

646
00:53:42,216 --> 00:53:44,941
Now, we have a top echelon fence
with a lube hose in his mouth,

647
00:53:45,147 --> 00:53:48,133
automatic weapons,
a jacket full of priors on
every one of these Asian punks,

648
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:50,738
a garage full of DVD players
and generally
psychotic behavior.

649
00:53:50,942 --> 00:53:53,632
Now, tell me why we shouldn't
move on Johnny Tran right now...

650
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:57,166
and see where we are
when the dust settles.
Because all we have is behavior.

651
00:53:57,402 --> 00:54:00,298
Just let me get some hard
evidence, because what we have
now is just circumstantial--

652
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,396
[ Bilkins ]
What we have is probable cause.

653
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:05,460
And truckers arming themselves
for some good old-fashioned
vigilante mayhem.

654
00:54:05,662 --> 00:54:07,594
- Tell us about Hector, Brian.
- Oh, Latinos with spear guns.
Give me a break.

655
00:54:07,594 --> 00:54:09,581
- Tell us about Hector, Brian.
- Oh, Latinos with spear guns.
Give me a break.

656
00:54:09,825 --> 00:54:13,618
No, Hector's still working
on the engines for the cars,
but the tires don't match.

657
00:54:13,821 --> 00:54:16,308
Will some-- Will someone
just give me a cigarette ?
Get him a cigarette.

658
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,483
Don't get him a cigarette.
I thought you quit.

659
00:54:18,717 --> 00:54:20,579
Yeah, I did quit.
Just give me a cigarette.

660
00:54:20,782 --> 00:54:22,838
Get him a cigarette.
No !

661
00:54:23,081 --> 00:54:25,840
Tell me about Toretto.

662
00:54:26,045 --> 00:54:28,475
Well, I told you, I think
he's too controlled for this.

663
00:54:28,709 --> 00:54:30,640
I mean what ? Going suicidal
on semi-trucks ? No way.

664
00:54:30,874 --> 00:54:33,962
I mean, maybe his buddy,
Vince, but he's
too stupid to pull it off.

665
00:54:34,171 --> 00:54:37,998
- I think the kid sister's
blurring your vision.
- What did you say ?

666
00:54:38,201 --> 00:54:41,790
I don't blame you.
I'd get off on her
surveillance photos too, buddy.

667
00:54:41,997 --> 00:54:43,621

668
00:54:44,862 --> 00:54:46,723
Knock it off!

669
00:54:46,927 --> 00:54:48,823
What ? Are you going
native on me, Brian ?

670
00:54:54,053 --> 00:54:55,950
Have you read
Toretto's flle lately ?

671
00:54:56,151 --> 00:54:58,013
Yeah.
I memorized that flle.

672
00:54:58,216 --> 00:55:01,271
Yeah, well read it again.
No, better still,
take a look at these.

673
00:55:03,345 --> 00:55:06,172
Remember I told you about
the guy he nearly
beat to death ?

674
00:55:06,376 --> 00:55:10,532
Toretto did this with
a three-quarter inch
torque wrench.

675
00:55:10,739 --> 00:55:13,827
He's a model
of self-control.

676
00:55:16,067 --> 00:55:17,928
I need a few more days.

677
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:21,396
I need a few more days.

[ Rap ]

680
00:55:26,058 --> 00:55:27,919
Got a T.R.-seven here
with a ball-bearing upgrade.

681
00:55:28,123 --> 00:55:30,019
What it's gonna do
is, it's gonna--
[ Hisses ]

682
00:55:30,221 --> 00:55:32,083
It's gonna spool up
really quick.

683

for twenty-four P.S.I.

big plans tonight ?

Yeah, we're going
out to dinner.

687
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:46,936
You break her heart,
I'll break your neck.

That's not gonna happen.
