1
00:00:21,743 --> 00:00:23,203
Howdy, boys.

2
00:00:23,245 --> 00:00:25,038
Oh, sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

3
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,915
How are you guys doing? Good?

4
00:00:26,957 --> 00:00:30,460
Why don't you, uh, go have
a smoke or something, okay?

5
00:00:30,502 --> 00:00:31,461
I got this.

6
00:00:31,503 --> 00:00:35,757
Oh, and, uh, you guys...

7
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:38,719
you are the real heroes.

8
00:00:56,945 --> 00:00:59,322
Gentlemen.

9
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:04,578
Oh!

10
00:01:18,717 --> 00:01:21,303
♪ Sharif don't like it ♪

11
00:01:21,344 --> 00:01:23,305
♪ Rock the casbah ♪

12
00:01:23,346 --> 00:01:25,348

00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:34,399
♪ Sharif don't like it. ♪

16
00:02:08,558 --> 00:02:10,769
All clear, boys.

17
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:11,978
Mission accomplished.

18
00:02:18,902 --> 00:02:20,862
God bless America.

19
00:02:20,904 --> 00:02:22,364
Captain.

20
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:25,867
I found this.

21
00:02:27,953 --> 00:02:30,330
The Islamic State is not exactly

22
00:02:30,372 --> 00:02:34,793
a hotbed
of scientific expertise.

23
00:02:34,835 --> 00:02:36,920
But they've counterfeited

24
00:02:36,962 --> 00:02:39,881
this Compound V shit of yours?

25
00:02:39,923 --> 00:02:43,718
It seems that way,
Mr. Secretary.

26
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,221
How did they get the formula?

27
00:02:46,263 --> 00:02:48,765
Honestly, we have no idea.

28
00:02:48,807 --> 00:02:52,394
Well, you must have some idea.

29
00:02:52,435 --> 00:02:55,814
Some tourist shoplift it
from your lab?

30
00:02:55,856 --> 00:02:58,358
Or maybe an inside job?

31
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,319
Sir, we would like to get
to the bottom of this

32
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:02,696
as much as you would.

33
00:03:02,737 --> 00:03:03,989
Ms. Stillwell,

34
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,075
if I had my way,
the Justice Department

35
00:03:07,117 --> 00:03:09,286
would haul your smug,
tennis-toned ass

36
00:03:09,327 --> 00:03:12,706
into Congress
and make you testify

37
00:03:12,747 --> 00:03:14,708
to corporate fraud.

38
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:19,045
What is Lockheed Martin's
number one product?

39
00:03:19,087 --> 00:03:20,046
Sorry?

40
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:21,840
Its top seller.

41
00:03:21,882 --> 00:03:23,216
You should know this,

42
00:03:23,258 --> 00:03:25,427
you served
on their board of directors.

43
00:03:25,468 --> 00:03:27,470
- The Patriot missile.
- Correct.

44
00:03:27,512 --> 00:03:28,847
Northrop?

45
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:30,265
B-2 Stealth.

46
00:03:30,307 --> 00:03:31,892
General Dynamics?

47
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:35,103
Tomahawk and the M1 Abrams.

48
00:03:35,145 --> 00:03:38,190
Billions of dollars
of bleeding-edge hardware.

49
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:42,485
Do you know what all of that
is as of today?

50
00:03:42,527 --> 00:03:45,572
A worthless pile of shit.

51
00:03:45,614 --> 00:03:49,117
Because Naqib and other
super terrorists like him

52
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,661
can flick away that junk
like flicking a flea.

53
00:03:51,703 --> 00:03:55,373
So it doesn't matter
where heroes really come from.

54
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:57,375
Frankly, it doesn't even matter

55
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:59,711
how the enemy got
the Compound V.

56
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:02,422
What matters is they've got it.

57
00:04:02,464 --> 00:04:05,884
It is a whole new world now.

58
00:04:05,926 --> 00:04:08,053
And there is only one company

59
00:04:08,094 --> 00:04:11,890
that has the product
to fight back.

60
00:04:15,644 --> 00:04:17,646
My company.

61
00:04:17,687 --> 00:04:19,648
My product.

62
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:22,192
What can I say?

63
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:25,070
The Pentagon's agreed to keep
Compound V classified.

64
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:26,696
Classified?

65
00:04:26,738 --> 00:04:28,365
What the fuck are you on about?

66
00:04:28,406 --> 00:04:31,076
Because of the Naqib asshole
that is out there,

67
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:33,370
we have to keep Vought
happy now.

68
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:36,248
Vought are the ones that fucking
created the cunt.

69
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:38,833
- We have no solid proof on that.
- No hard proof?

70
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,253
I fucking well rescued
the proof from a basement.

71
00:04:41,294 --> 00:04:44,130
She's sitting on a bloody bog
as we speak.

72
00:04:44,172 --> 00:04:45,715
Listen. Listen.

73
00:04:45,757 --> 00:04:47,717
Vought's manufacturing
super villains.

74
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,010
It's the story of the century.

75
00:04:49,052 --> 00:04:52,347
Don't you want
a fucking Pulitzer?

76
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:54,307
Well, fuck you, too, then.

77
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,906
Susan, come on.

78
00:05:09,948 --> 00:05:13,285
There must be something
we can do here, yeah?

79
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:16,371
Look, the military deal
is signed and sealed.

80
00:05:16,413 --> 00:05:19,207
Do you think one mute girl
is going to derail that?

81
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:20,792
Especially coming
from the fugitives

82
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:23,753
- that killed Translucent?
- Fugitives?

83
00:05:23,795 --> 00:05:27,757
Vought insisted and...
and the DOJ agreed.

84
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:29,426
You're wanted men now.

85
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:31,386
Hello?

86
00:05:31,428 --> 00:05:32,679
This isn't a day spa.

87
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:34,514
Other people got
to use the facilities.

88
00:05:58,413 --> 00:06:00,707
Look, I gave you the V.

89
00:06:00,749 --> 00:06:03,084
I gave you everything
you asked for and more.

90
00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:04,979
I trusted you, and this is
the fucking thanks I get.

91
00:06:05,003 --> 00:06:07,964
Butcher, I will still protect
your families.

92
00:06:08,006 --> 00:06:10,342
Yeah, and keep
your bleeding career even safer.

93
00:06:10,383 --> 00:06:12,427
Well, what about me
and the Boys, then, eh?

94
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:14,888
You cut bait and run
for your lives.

95
00:06:14,929 --> 00:06:17,474
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:22,520
Yeah, mm-hmm.

97
00:06:22,562 --> 00:06:23,688
Right.

98
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,232
All right, then, love.

99
00:06:26,274 --> 00:06:29,486
Well, that's all under control,
isn't it?

100
00:06:29,527 --> 00:06:32,322
- Oh. We need to split up.
- Mm-hmm.

101
00:06:32,364 --> 00:06:33,948
Oi, what the fuck are you doing?

102
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,367
We ain't, we ain't done yet.

103
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:37,035
The hell we ain't.

104
00:06:37,077 --> 00:06:38,554
We got Vought, the Supes,
and the Feds on our asses.

105
00:06:38,578 --> 00:06:39,788
I'm going to Montreal.

106
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:40,997
Yeah, and how you gonna get

107
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,058
your crazy-ass girlfriend
over the border?

108
00:06:42,082 --> 00:06:43,082
She has a name.

109
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:46,044
It's Kimiko. Okay?

110
00:06:46,086 --> 00:06:47,504
- Kimiko.
- Oi, listen.

111
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:48,963
Shut your fucking traps.

112
00:06:49,005 --> 00:06:51,341
We're on the verge of nailing
these cunts.

113
00:06:51,383 --> 00:06:53,009
And you want to cut bait and run

114
00:06:53,051 --> 00:06:54,928
before we've played
our final card.

115
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:57,430
Okay, what is it, man?

116
00:06:57,472 --> 00:07:00,725
Give us a couple hours. Yeah?

117
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:01,810
Hughie, you're with me.

118
00:07:03,853 --> 00:07:05,063
Come on, son.

119
00:07:05,105 --> 00:07:07,107
Chop, chop.

120
00:07:22,997 --> 00:07:25,417
Oh! Annie.

121
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,918
You scared me.

122
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,003
You didn't say you were coming.

123
00:07:31,548 --> 00:07:34,801
I hid this under my floorboards
right after Daddy left.

124
00:07:36,344 --> 00:07:38,138
I thought that maybe

125
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:40,390
he would come back
for it, but...

126
00:07:41,808 --> 00:07:44,102
- Still smells like him.
- It was a bad habit.

127
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:46,771
His father smoked a pipe,
so, you know...

128
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:49,691
What's Compound V?

129
00:07:49,732 --> 00:07:51,276
Uh, Compound V?

130
00:07:51,317 --> 00:07:52,694
I don't know, sweetheart.

131
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:53,736
Should I?

132
00:07:59,242 --> 00:08:01,870
How old was I? Hmm?

133
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:08,168
How old was I when you let
Vought pump me full of drugs?

134
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:10,438
- Annie, honestly, I don't know what you're talk...
- How old,

135
00:08:10,462 --> 00:08:12,714
when you let them turn me
into a freak?

136
00:08:12,755 --> 00:08:14,507
You're not a freak.

137
00:08:14,549 --> 00:08:15,800
Never say that.

138
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:20,763
So it's true.

139
00:08:27,812 --> 00:08:29,230
Annie...

140
00:08:29,272 --> 00:08:33,067
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

141
00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:41,075
- Did, did Vought tell you all this?
- No.

142
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:43,828
No. A friend told me.

143
00:08:48,082 --> 00:08:49,918
How much did they pay you?

144
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:53,588
- It wasn't about money.
- How much?

145
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,589
There was no money.

146
00:08:54,631 --> 00:08:56,216
They, they, they just paid

147
00:08:56,257 --> 00:08:58,801
for the medical bills,
that's it.

148
00:08:58,843 --> 00:09:01,304
I did it because they,
they promised

149
00:09:01,346 --> 00:09:04,849
that you'd have a chance
at an extraordinary life.

150
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:08,186
To be strong and successful
and special.

151
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:10,063
I mean, who wouldn't
want that for their...

152
00:09:10,104 --> 00:09:12,982
You made me think that I was
chosen by God.

153
00:09:13,024 --> 00:09:14,192
You were!

154
00:09:14,234 --> 00:09:15,610
God brought Vought
into our lives.

155
00:09:15,652 --> 00:09:16,861
He made this possible.

156
00:09:16,903 --> 00:09:18,821
Bullshit!

157
00:09:18,863 --> 00:09:20,448
You did!

158
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,911
And then you controlled
every single minute of it.

159
00:09:24,953 --> 00:09:27,121
You woke me up at 5:00 a.m.

160
00:09:27,163 --> 00:09:29,499
to train
for those stupid pageants,

161
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:33,211
and the tap dancing
and the tae kwon do.

162
00:09:33,253 --> 00:09:35,421
I gave up every moment
of my life.

163
00:09:35,463 --> 00:09:36,923
I-I... and I was happy to do it.

164
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:37,924
This was our dream.

165
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:39,342
This was your dream!

166
00:09:39,384 --> 00:09:43,972
I never got a chance
to choose my own dreams.

167
00:09:44,013 --> 00:09:46,516
No wonder I don't know who
the fuck I'm supposed to be!

168
00:09:46,558 --> 00:09:48,101
Annie.

169
00:09:55,483 --> 00:09:57,735
Was it really bad investments?

170
00:09:57,777 --> 00:09:59,696
- What?
- You told me that Daddy left

171
00:09:59,737 --> 00:10:02,240
because he lost
all of our savings.

172
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,871
He agreed to all of it.

173
00:10:08,913 --> 00:10:13,334
And then, one day,
he... he didn't,

174
00:10:13,376 --> 00:10:15,378
so he walked out on us.

175
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:22,594
Maybe he didn't want
to lie to me.

176
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:24,721
So I'm the monster?

177
00:10:24,762 --> 00:10:26,556
You have a good life.

178
00:10:26,598 --> 00:10:30,310
People would give anything
to be what you are.

179
00:10:30,351 --> 00:10:33,354
I thought I did what was right.

180
00:10:35,607 --> 00:10:37,567
Annie, Annie.

181
00:10:37,609 --> 00:10:40,820
Annie! Annie!

182
00:10:40,862 --> 00:10:43,323
It's time to knock back some
of this per diem, buddy.

183
00:10:43,364 --> 00:10:45,950
Oh, it's a pretty fancy bottle.

184
00:10:45,992 --> 00:10:49,746
What are we, uh,
what are we celebrating?

185
00:10:49,787 --> 00:10:51,599
What are you talking about?
The Seven getting called up.

186
00:10:51,623 --> 00:10:52,790
Yeah.

187
00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:57,462
You know the whole reason
the Navy discontinued

188
00:10:57,503 --> 00:11:00,757
their Sea Mammal
mine clearance program?

189
00:11:00,798 --> 00:11:02,216
It's because it cost
way too much

190
00:11:02,258 --> 00:11:04,344
to train the fucking dolphins.

191
00:11:04,385 --> 00:11:05,928
Yeah.

192
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,597
But with me on board,

193
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,141
it's like a, it's like
a pick-up game of basketball.

194
00:11:11,893 --> 00:11:14,937
I've always wanted to lead
my own unit, Jeff.

195
00:11:14,979 --> 00:11:16,397
It's like a dream
come true for me.

196
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:25,365
Smells like a comeback.

197
00:11:26,407 --> 00:11:28,117
- Anyways...
- Hmm.

198
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,911
Cheers, buddy.

199
00:11:29,952 --> 00:11:32,455
So, when?

200
00:11:32,497 --> 00:11:34,415
When, what?

201
00:11:34,457 --> 00:11:36,250
When do I ship out?

202
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:38,169
Oh.

203
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:39,921
Gosh.

204
00:11:39,962 --> 00:11:42,757
You know that water park's
opening up a new splash zone,

205
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,175
and, and they are real excited

206
00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:45,718
to have you cut that ribbon.

207
00:11:48,596 --> 00:11:50,682
You know, I'm seriously
leaving, Jeff.

208
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:52,350
Fuck Ohio.

209
00:11:54,644 --> 00:11:57,313
Here's the sitch.

210
00:11:57,355 --> 00:11:59,273
I-I talked to New York.

211
00:11:59,315 --> 00:12:02,235
And... you're not.

212
00:12:02,276 --> 00:12:03,945
So much.

213
00:12:03,986 --> 00:12:04,987
Leaving.

214
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:08,157
What?

215
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:11,744
They didn't share details.

216
00:12:11,786 --> 00:12:14,706
But hey, look...

217
00:12:14,747 --> 00:12:19,043
the boys in marketing have
created a primo tag for you:

218
00:12:19,085 --> 00:12:21,754
The Savior of Sandusky!

219
00:12:23,297 --> 00:12:25,675
That has a nice ring,
doesn't it?

220
00:13:00,376 --> 00:13:01,919
William.

221
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:07,508
What are you looking at
out there?

222
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,135
Eastern meadowlarks.

223
00:13:09,177 --> 00:13:13,431
It was either bird-watching
or alcoholism, so...

224
00:13:13,473 --> 00:13:15,183
birds.

225
00:13:15,224 --> 00:13:16,642
I thought we agreed that you

226
00:13:16,684 --> 00:13:19,020
were never going
to come out here.

227
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:21,856
Yeah, well,
you taught me a thing or two

228
00:13:21,898 --> 00:13:24,859
about broken promises.

229
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:27,028
Didn't you?

230
00:13:28,362 --> 00:13:30,364
This is Hugh Campbell.

231
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:34,076
We're working
with M.M. and Frenchie.

232
00:13:34,118 --> 00:13:36,162
I got the Boys back together.

233
00:13:36,204 --> 00:13:37,538
Grace Mallory.

234
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,999
I'm the founder
of your little club.

235
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:43,085
- You're, uh...
- So, let me hear it.

236
00:13:45,588 --> 00:13:47,757
I need your help.

237
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,425
Sorry, I can't.

238
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:52,887
I'm hoping to photograph
a snowy owl in the dunes.

239
00:13:54,931 --> 00:13:56,682
Look...

240
00:13:56,724 --> 00:13:59,477
I didn't want to come here,

241
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,063
but I need your help.

242
00:14:02,104 --> 00:14:04,899
And you're going to
fucking help.

243
00:14:04,941 --> 00:14:06,734
Why's that?

244
00:14:13,574 --> 00:14:16,452
Because you owe me.

245
00:14:16,494 --> 00:14:18,955
You fucking owe me, goddamn it.

246
00:15:15,803 --> 00:15:16,846
Look at you, mon coeur.

247
00:15:19,056 --> 00:15:20,933
Run! Run!

248
00:15:49,086 --> 00:15:51,047
Who's got eyes on her?

249
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:53,591
Over here!

250
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,643
Good job.

251
00:16:03,684 --> 00:16:06,228
We won't let her get away.

252
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,524
This is Alpha Team.

253
00:16:10,566 --> 00:16:12,902
Suspect is in custody.

254
00:16:12,944 --> 00:16:15,404
There's simply nothing else
to say. I can't help you.

255
00:16:15,446 --> 00:16:17,049
Well, you're gonna have to do
better than that.

256
00:16:17,073 --> 00:16:20,409
- Do I? Why?
- 'Cause you made me a promise.

257
00:16:20,451 --> 00:16:22,286
But then my grandchildren
got incinerated.

258
00:16:22,328 --> 00:16:24,872
Tends to change
one's perspective.

259
00:16:24,914 --> 00:16:26,374
There weren't even teeth left,

260
00:16:26,415 --> 00:16:29,335
Lamplighter had burnt them alive
so thoroughly.

261
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:33,506
Well,

262
00:16:33,547 --> 00:16:37,468
I think I've had
enough sun for one day.

263
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,679
Pleasure meeting you, Hugh.

264
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,138
Butcher.

265
00:16:42,974 --> 00:16:44,934
Well, what about
what you've done?

266
00:16:44,976 --> 00:16:46,394
What I've done?

267
00:16:47,436 --> 00:16:49,271
To who?

268
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:55,111
To me, goddamn it. To me.

269
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:57,113
You trained me up,
manipulated me,

270
00:16:57,154 --> 00:16:59,573
aimed me at Homelander
like a fucking howitzer.

271
00:16:59,615 --> 00:17:03,160
And then when it didn't suit you
anymore, you just threw me away.

272
00:17:03,202 --> 00:17:05,621
And not a day goes by
I don't regret it.

273
00:17:05,663 --> 00:17:07,832
Day late, dollar short, love.

274
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,629
Now, I'm going to finish
what you started,

275
00:17:13,671 --> 00:17:15,673
and I need your help.

276
00:17:19,301 --> 00:17:21,303
Please.

277
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:30,479
You can leave with something,

278
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:32,773
if you never come back

279
00:17:32,815 --> 00:17:35,443
and you keep your
goddamn promise this time.

280
00:17:39,447 --> 00:17:40,948
Madelyn Stillwell.

281
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,742
Vought's VP?

282
00:17:42,783 --> 00:17:44,386
- Homelander's her main account.
- Yeah, that ain't news.

283
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,371
No, but this is:

284
00:17:47,413 --> 00:17:49,665
They have a...
What shall we say?

285
00:17:49,707 --> 00:17:52,126
A very special relationship.

286
00:17:52,168 --> 00:17:54,754
Complicated, intimate,
hard to quantify.

287
00:17:54,795 --> 00:17:56,297
And you know this how?

288
00:17:56,338 --> 00:17:58,716
Still have a few fingers
in a few pies.

289
00:17:58,758 --> 00:18:00,885
I don't know
if Homelander has a weakness,

290
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:04,055
but if he does, she'll know it.

291
00:18:09,685 --> 00:18:12,646
Good-bye, Grace.

292
00:18:12,688 --> 00:18:15,316
You want to kill yourself,
that's your right...

293
00:18:15,357 --> 00:18:19,987
I won't stop you...
But, Billy, not the others.

294
00:18:22,782 --> 00:18:25,201
Vengeance isn't a path
to glory, Hugh.

295
00:18:25,242 --> 00:18:28,079
It's a one-way ticket
to a dead end,

296
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,499
looking at fucking birds.

297
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,301
Oh... No, go ahead.

298
00:18:42,343 --> 00:18:44,220
Sure.

299
00:19:12,248 --> 00:19:15,042
Dude. Dude, it's A-Train.

300
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:16,293
Really?

301
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,172
It's fucking A-Train.

302
00:19:22,216 --> 00:19:23,884
Can I help you?

303
00:19:23,926 --> 00:19:25,469
I'm just keeping an eye out.

304
00:19:26,637 --> 00:19:28,764
That's funny, um,

305
00:19:28,806 --> 00:19:32,518
it really looks like you're
only keeping an eye on me.

306
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,645
You know I'm A-Train, right?

307
00:19:34,687 --> 00:19:37,940
Yeah, and I'm Homelander.

308
00:19:37,982 --> 00:19:39,817
Dude, whip back to A-Train.

309
00:19:42,027 --> 00:19:43,737
Oh.

310
00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:45,990
Listen, I'm sorry about that.

311
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:47,408
We're good.

312
00:19:47,449 --> 00:19:50,035
Oh. Wait, so now that you...

313
00:19:50,077 --> 00:19:52,746
now you know I'm A-Train,
now we're good?

314
00:19:52,788 --> 00:19:56,083
Listen, man, I'm sorry.
It was my mistake.

315
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:59,128
Yeah, you're damn right
it's your mistake.

316
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,546
I'm A-Train.

317
00:20:00,588 --> 00:20:03,299
I'm the fastest
fucking man alive!

318
00:20:05,718 --> 00:20:09,096
What are you all
fucking looking at?

319
00:20:15,561 --> 00:20:17,813
- You missed it.
- Eyes front.

320
00:20:17,855 --> 00:20:19,857
Eyes fucking front, Hughie.

321
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:21,859
- Boys are gone.
- What?

322
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:23,444
Someone's grabbed them.

323
00:20:23,485 --> 00:20:25,446
Oh, yeah? How do you know that?

324
00:20:25,487 --> 00:20:27,364
The window's new,
the front path is scrubbed,

325
00:20:27,406 --> 00:20:29,408
and there's a black van
with "Flowers" on it,

326
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,368
probably full of cunts
waiting to jump us.

327
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,787
- Vought?
- Nah, someone else doing

328
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:35,080
their dirty work for them,

329
00:20:35,122 --> 00:20:37,541
probably some
Fed black ops unit.

330
00:20:43,339 --> 00:20:45,716
Okay. Okay, what are we...
what-what are we gonna do?

331
00:20:45,758 --> 00:20:47,551
How are we gonna get
the guys back?

332
00:20:47,593 --> 00:20:49,970
- We're on our own.
- We've got to get to Stillwell

333
00:20:50,012 --> 00:20:52,490
- before the walls close in.
- Who gives a fuck about Stillwell?

334
00:20:52,514 --> 00:20:54,367
- We have to go back for them.
- You don't get it, Hughie.

335
00:20:54,391 --> 00:20:56,435
We got about a couple hours
before they find us,

336
00:20:56,477 --> 00:20:57,770
and that's if we're lucky.

337
00:20:57,811 --> 00:21:00,481
We got to hit back
and hit back now.

338
00:21:00,522 --> 00:21:01,982
You're abandoning them.

339
00:21:02,024 --> 00:21:05,069
I mean, they all...
they risked their...

340
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,112
Mother's Milk has a daughter.

341
00:21:07,154 --> 00:21:08,381
They'd want us
to finish the job.

342
00:21:08,405 --> 00:21:10,616
Your job.

343
00:21:10,658 --> 00:21:14,161
Your job, not theirs.

344
00:21:14,203 --> 00:21:16,580
It's all about Homelander,
isn't it?

345
00:21:16,622 --> 00:21:19,875
And A-Train. This is your
fucking shit, too, Hughie.

346
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:21,877
I promised you payback,
didn't I?

347
00:21:23,295 --> 00:21:25,589
Mallory give you the same speech
back in the day?

348
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:26,966
Yeah. Yeah, she did.

349
00:21:27,007 --> 00:21:29,343
But she broke her promise.

350
00:21:29,385 --> 00:21:30,970
I'm keeping mine.

351
00:21:33,138 --> 00:21:35,224
I'm so fucking stupid.

352
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:38,936
You never cared about me.

353
00:21:38,978 --> 00:21:41,313
Or Robin, did you?

354
00:21:41,355 --> 00:21:44,149
I was just useful to you.

355
00:21:44,191 --> 00:21:46,568
Fuck, Hughie.
Of course you're useful.

356
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,988
I mean, that's why you're here,
isn't it?

357
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:53,534
Now we just got to take
one more step.

358
00:21:53,575 --> 00:21:55,536
Yeah?

359
00:21:55,577 --> 00:21:57,538
Come on.

360
00:21:57,579 --> 00:21:59,498
No.

361
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,084
We have to save them.

362
00:22:02,126 --> 00:22:04,253
For fuck's sakes, Hughie,
we don't have time

363
00:22:04,295 --> 00:22:06,255
for this shit right now, okay?

364
00:22:06,297 --> 00:22:09,091
We get Stillwell.
Now, get in the fucking car.

365
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:11,093
Then what?

366
00:22:11,135 --> 00:22:13,470
Becca comes back from the dead?
Robin, too?

367
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:16,348
This is never gonna stop...
It's just gonna be more blood

368
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,600
and... awfulness.

369
00:22:20,477 --> 00:22:22,438
That's the fucking game.

370
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:25,858
If you don't like to play, why
did you join the fucking team?

371
00:22:27,651 --> 00:22:30,131
Mallory's right... you're just
gonna drag us all down with you.

372
00:22:31,363 --> 00:22:33,615
Not me.

373
00:22:33,657 --> 00:22:35,492
Not anymore.

374
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:41,206
You're a fucking pathetic cunt

375
00:22:41,248 --> 00:22:43,834
and an insult to Robin's memory.

376
00:22:45,085 --> 00:22:47,379
I think I'm doing this for her.

377
00:22:52,092 --> 00:22:54,094
Good-bye, Hughie.

you like to come here to listen

396
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:09,021
to the choir rehearse,
so I, I figured I'd take a shot.

397
00:25:09,062 --> 00:25:10,772
You've got a lot of balls.

398
00:25:10,814 --> 00:25:13,150
Just two.

399
00:25:13,192 --> 00:25:16,528
I mean, you must want me
to arrest you.

400
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:19,656
Actually, uh...

401
00:25:21,366 --> 00:25:26,038
Annie... I need your help.

402
00:25:35,047 --> 00:25:36,381
- Please just listen to me.
- Why?

403
00:25:36,423 --> 00:25:38,425
More awful secrets
you want to tell me,

404
00:25:38,467 --> 00:25:40,427
more drugs that I was dosed
with as a kid, maybe?

405
00:25:40,469 --> 00:25:42,221
Look, that just came out.
I'm sorry.

406
00:25:42,262 --> 00:25:43,948
I-I thought you... maybe
you wanted to know the truth.

407
00:25:43,972 --> 00:25:46,141
Oh, okay, so you're
all about the truth.

408
00:25:46,183 --> 00:25:48,977
Vought is giving Compound V
to some bad fucking people,

409
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:50,395
like really bad.

410
00:25:50,437 --> 00:25:52,439
Like, that Supe terrorist.

411
00:25:53,857 --> 00:25:55,817
That's insane.

412
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:57,861
No, it's true.

413
00:25:57,903 --> 00:26:00,072
Look, my friends want to stop
it, but they got caught

414
00:26:00,113 --> 00:26:02,699
on Vought's orders,
and I, and I figured,

415
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:06,161
because you had
security clearance,

416
00:26:06,203 --> 00:26:08,247
maybe you could help find them.

417
00:26:10,707 --> 00:26:14,294
Hughie, I was almost arrested
just for knowing you.

418
00:26:14,336 --> 00:26:17,297
I had to convince them that I
was an idiot that you threw out

419
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:19,132
and you used,
and now you want me

420
00:26:19,174 --> 00:26:21,677
to help
your psycho killer friends?

421
00:26:21,718 --> 00:26:24,680
When you put it like that...

422
00:26:24,721 --> 00:26:29,017
You have 30 seconds
to get the hell out of here.

423
00:26:32,187 --> 00:26:34,773
Okay.

424
00:26:34,815 --> 00:26:36,817
I'm sorry to bother you.

425
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,612
I mean, why the hell

426
00:26:40,654 --> 00:26:43,657
would I ever help you?

427
00:26:48,161 --> 00:26:50,872
Because Vought's up
to some evil shit?

428
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:55,335
'Cause it's your job.

429
00:26:57,379 --> 00:26:59,590
Because you're a superhero.

430
00:26:59,631 --> 00:27:01,633
Really?

431
00:27:03,885 --> 00:27:07,097
I can't remember the last time
I saved anyone.

432
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:08,557
You saved me.

433
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:11,518
When did I ever save you?

434
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,772
Bowling alley.

435
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:20,027
What are you talking about?

436
00:27:23,322 --> 00:27:26,491
I was, I was angry after Robin.

437
00:27:26,533 --> 00:27:32,122
I was headed for this cliff, and
then you and me went bowling.

438
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:35,375
Bowling?

439
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:37,377
Yeah.

440
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:39,379
Bowling.

441
00:27:39,421 --> 00:27:41,340
That's it.

442
00:27:41,381 --> 00:27:46,053
That's not saving you,
that's, that's just being there.

443
00:27:52,768 --> 00:27:54,770
The thing is...

444
00:28:03,737 --> 00:28:05,739
I don't care.

445
00:28:34,476 --> 00:28:37,229
Hey!

446
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,690
What the hell are you doing?

447
00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:42,526
Doc said six weeks minimum
after a fracture like that.

448
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:44,403
I'm all good, man.

449
00:28:44,444 --> 00:28:46,154
Look, I'm back to training.

450
00:28:46,196 --> 00:28:48,448
I feel fucking great.

451
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,866
- You're healed?
- I'm healed.

452
00:28:49,908 --> 00:28:51,952
How the fuck are you hea...

453
00:28:53,578 --> 00:28:55,997
You back on that Compound V.

454
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,125
You promised me
that you would stay clean.

455
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:00,168
No. I am clean.

456
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,462
A-1, all-natural A-Train, baby.

457
00:29:02,504 --> 00:29:06,091
Your fucking bones fused back
together overnight?

458
00:29:06,133 --> 00:29:08,885
- That sound natural to you?
- Maybe I'm just strong.

459
00:29:08,927 --> 00:29:12,347
- Oh, yeah.
- I am the world's fastest man.

460
00:29:15,684 --> 00:29:17,561
Bet you can't outrun this.

461
00:29:17,602 --> 00:29:20,564
Hey. Wait, hey, where you going?

462
00:29:20,605 --> 00:29:23,775
I'm not gonna sit here
and watch you kill yourself.

463
00:29:23,817 --> 00:29:28,405
You know what?
I don't need this shit.

464
00:29:28,447 --> 00:29:31,408
You've always just been jealous
of me, so go ahead,

465
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,701
slow-ass fucking loser.

466
00:30:09,654 --> 00:30:13,658
Huh... I'm just, yeah, I'm just
gonna...

467
00:30:25,462 --> 00:30:27,255
- There he is!
- Our hero.

468
00:30:29,257 --> 00:30:32,677
Stop it.

469
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:34,346
Stop, please.

470
00:30:42,854 --> 00:30:46,274
Amazing. Great job, everybody.

471
00:30:46,316 --> 00:30:48,026
You're gonna make me blush here.
Madelyn?

472
00:30:48,068 --> 00:30:50,821
- Stop, please.
- Mr. Edgar.

473
00:30:50,862 --> 00:30:53,490
Uh, I, uh, I didn't know
you were gonna come.

474
00:30:53,532 --> 00:30:55,450
Let me borrow you for a moment.

475
00:31:09,214 --> 00:31:11,591
The Pentagon's shelling out
north of $40 billion per year.

476
00:31:11,633 --> 00:31:13,844
You should enjoy a bonus
that reflects that.

477
00:31:15,053 --> 00:31:17,264
I-I don't know what to say.

478
00:31:17,305 --> 00:31:18,682
Well, say thank you.

479
00:31:18,723 --> 00:31:21,101
Thank you.

480
00:31:21,142 --> 00:31:23,103
Don't get too excited.

481
00:31:23,144 --> 00:31:24,729
It comes with strings.

482
00:31:24,771 --> 00:31:26,898
You're gonna need to move
your office down to 82.

483
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,900
- That's your floor.
- And

484
00:31:28,942 --> 00:31:31,695
I'm gonna want you to start
riding shotgun on my meetings.

485
00:31:31,736 --> 00:31:33,738
Hey, don't go planning
my retirement yet.

486
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,866
I'm just saying, someone
needs to run this shit show

487
00:31:35,907 --> 00:31:38,493
when I move to Belize.

488
00:31:38,535 --> 00:31:40,120
Enjoy yourself, Madelyn.

489
00:31:40,161 --> 00:31:43,415
Start thinking
about the view from 82.

490
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:47,085
Thank you.

491
00:31:57,429 --> 00:32:01,558
Electricity goes in,
blast comes out.

492
00:32:05,562 --> 00:32:07,731
That's a hell of a party trick.

493
00:32:07,772 --> 00:32:11,443
Do you ever, um, use it for fun?

494
00:32:11,484 --> 00:32:15,071
Can I tell you a secret?

495
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:19,743
Sometimes,
my eyes light up when I...

496
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:21,161
you know.

497
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:29,878
- Will you excuse me?
- Uh...

498
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,172
Just a second.

499
00:32:47,228 --> 00:32:50,023
You want me to hold
your hair back?

500
00:32:50,065 --> 00:32:52,192
Don't touch.

501
00:32:53,485 --> 00:32:55,362
Leave me alone,
I'm not in the mood.

502
00:32:55,403 --> 00:32:57,113
Not in the mood for what?

503
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:01,868
Your bottomless casual cruelty.

504
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,662
So just make
whatever shitty comment

505
00:33:03,703 --> 00:33:05,413
you're gonna make and then go.

506
00:33:13,129 --> 00:33:14,965
Look.

507
00:33:17,258 --> 00:33:19,052
What am I supposed to be
looking at?

508
00:33:19,094 --> 00:33:23,223
No... my radius
never healed straight.

509
00:33:26,267 --> 00:33:29,479
I really did break every bone
in my right arm.

510
00:33:29,521 --> 00:33:32,232
- What?
- Stopping the bus from falling.

511
00:33:32,273 --> 00:33:34,484
You said the marketing guys
made it up.

512
00:33:36,486 --> 00:33:37,862
It was me.

513
00:33:39,406 --> 00:33:41,449
23-year-old, bright-eyed,

514
00:33:41,491 --> 00:33:43,952
ass you could bounce
a quarter off of...

515
00:33:43,994 --> 00:33:45,453
me.

516
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:52,377
I really did want
to make a difference.

517
00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:54,045
I really did care.

518
00:33:56,047 --> 00:33:57,507
I was just like you.

519
00:33:59,384 --> 00:34:01,052
And then...

520
00:34:01,094 --> 00:34:04,889
I started giving pieces
of myself away and...

521
00:34:04,931 --> 00:34:07,684
I guess I gave away everything.

522
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:17,485
So you know what? Be...

523
00:34:17,527 --> 00:34:20,113
just be original.

524
00:34:20,155 --> 00:34:22,157
For fuck's sake.

525
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:25,869
My position is already taken.

526
00:34:30,623 --> 00:34:34,169
Be the annoying goody two-shoes
asshole that you are.

527
00:34:36,713 --> 00:34:39,007
One of us has to be.

528
00:35:09,788 --> 00:35:11,956
You've been avoiding me.

529
00:35:11,998 --> 00:35:14,375
- No, I haven't.
- Really?

530
00:35:14,417 --> 00:35:16,419
Seems that way.

531
00:35:18,296 --> 00:35:21,132
You do know that I went to see
Vogelbaum, though...

532
00:35:21,174 --> 00:35:22,842
right?

533
00:35:24,886 --> 00:35:27,430
And you do know what he told me?

534
00:35:27,472 --> 00:35:29,933
I never meant for you
to find out that way.

535
00:35:29,974 --> 00:35:32,519
Let me guess.
You wanted to protect me.

536
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,729
Well, we all did.

537
00:35:34,771 --> 00:35:36,689
Of course.

538
00:35:38,691 --> 00:35:39,943
You think I'm fragile?

539
00:35:39,984 --> 00:35:41,569
No, I do not.

540
00:35:41,611 --> 00:35:43,404
You try doing any of this...

541
00:35:43,446 --> 00:35:46,533
I mean fucking any of it...

542
00:35:46,574 --> 00:35:48,910
Without me...

543
00:35:48,952 --> 00:35:50,870
I couldn't.

544
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,580
Madelyn.

545
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:58,378
Did it ever occur to you that...

546
00:35:58,419 --> 00:36:00,880
a Supe terrorist showing up

547
00:36:00,922 --> 00:36:04,300
exactly when
we needed him to was...

548
00:36:04,342 --> 00:36:06,970
a pretty fucking
incredible coincidence?

549
00:36:09,013 --> 00:36:11,057
It's almost like...

550
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:13,351
someone planned it.

551
00:36:14,561 --> 00:36:17,438
Mm-hmm.

552
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,110
Me.

553
00:36:24,362 --> 00:36:26,114
Me.

554
00:36:26,156 --> 00:36:27,448
I made him.

555
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:31,286
What do you mean you "made him"?

556
00:36:31,327 --> 00:36:35,165
Well, I borrowed
some Compound V,

557
00:36:35,206 --> 00:36:37,876
had A-Train run it
all over the globe,

558
00:36:37,917 --> 00:36:40,795
and I supercharged some jihadis.

559
00:36:43,548 --> 00:36:45,508
Uh, not to oversimplify it.

560
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,069
I mean, it-it was actually
very difficult

561
00:36:47,093 --> 00:36:49,846
and very messy,
using adult subjects.

562
00:36:49,888 --> 00:36:52,182
There's a good reason
that Vought doesn't do it.

563
00:36:52,223 --> 00:36:54,934
But... well, enough survived

564
00:36:54,976 --> 00:36:58,730
to call the operation
a huge success.

565
00:36:59,772 --> 00:37:02,317
Huge.

566
00:37:02,358 --> 00:37:04,235
And now...

567
00:37:04,277 --> 00:37:09,449
we have villains
all over the globe...

568
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:12,368
that only we can fight.

569
00:37:13,369 --> 00:37:16,956
In sequel after sequel...

570
00:37:16,998 --> 00:37:18,875
after sequel.

571
00:37:23,296 --> 00:37:25,715
Well?

572
00:37:28,259 --> 00:37:29,802
Say something.

573
00:37:52,116 --> 00:37:54,035
No.

574
00:37:56,871 --> 00:37:58,790
Take off your pants.

575
00:38:14,555 --> 00:38:16,015
Sit down.

576
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:44,335
- Gentle.
- I'm...

577
00:38:46,879 --> 00:38:48,423
No.

578
00:38:55,596 --> 00:38:58,266
Oh, my sweet boy.

579
00:38:58,308 --> 00:39:02,520
My special, special, sweet boy.

580
00:39:05,148 --> 00:39:07,191
I'm gonna take care of you.

581
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,533
I'm sorry.

582
00:39:15,575 --> 00:39:17,618
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

583
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,996
- No, you did good.
- I'm sorry.

584
00:39:20,038 --> 00:39:22,332
Oh, my boy.

585
00:39:22,373 --> 00:39:24,876
I'm proud of you.

586
00:39:24,917 --> 00:39:26,961
That was so lovely.

587
00:39:30,131 --> 00:39:33,134
Well, you know,
in, uh, medieval times,

588
00:39:33,176 --> 00:39:35,511
they locked prisoners
inside a pillory barrel.

589
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,866
Then they'd kneel
in their own excrement

590
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:41,601
till they got sepsis
and died, so...

591
00:39:42,769 --> 00:39:45,396
Thank you, Frenchie,

592
00:39:45,438 --> 00:39:49,108
for that disgusting
yet fascinating piece of trivia.

593
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:51,235
I'm just saying
it could be worse, huh?

594
00:39:51,277 --> 00:39:52,737
Right.

595
00:39:59,202 --> 00:40:01,329
Why didn't you tell us?

596
00:40:01,371 --> 00:40:03,873
Tell you what?

597
00:40:03,915 --> 00:40:05,708
That you had a daughter.

598
00:40:09,712 --> 00:40:12,173
I don't know.

599
00:40:12,215 --> 00:40:13,674
I mean...

600
00:40:15,676 --> 00:40:17,345
I guess she's...

601
00:40:19,389 --> 00:40:21,682
the only good thing
I ever did, man.

602
00:40:23,976 --> 00:40:27,063
I just wanted just to leave her
clean out of it, you know?

603
00:40:29,065 --> 00:40:31,275
But I fucked that up
to high heaven.

604
00:40:33,694 --> 00:40:35,238
Probably never see her again.

605
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:37,281
I understand.

606
00:40:40,118 --> 00:40:41,702
She made you a better person.

607
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:50,128
Hey, man.

608
00:40:50,169 --> 00:40:52,088
Kimiko's gonna be okay.

609
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:57,135
So you do know her name.

610
00:40:57,176 --> 00:40:58,886
- Hmm.
- Do you like that?

611
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,765
No.

612
00:41:05,518 --> 00:41:07,520
Um...

613
00:41:07,562 --> 00:41:09,981
Mr. Edgar came
to the party tonight

614
00:41:10,022 --> 00:41:13,568
and he practically
offered me his job.

615
00:41:13,609 --> 00:41:15,236
Well, not right away.

616
00:41:15,278 --> 00:41:17,155
But he, um...

617
00:41:17,196 --> 00:41:18,823
wants me to move
to the 82nd floor

618
00:41:18,865 --> 00:41:20,450
so that I can be closer to him.

619
00:41:20,491 --> 00:41:22,076
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

620
00:41:22,118 --> 00:41:25,496
Okay, but y-you'll still be
my day-to-day, right?

621
00:41:25,538 --> 00:41:27,748
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

622
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,709
Of course.

623
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:32,420
I will be there for you always.

624
00:41:32,462 --> 00:41:34,172
Okay, good.

625
00:41:37,049 --> 00:41:38,551
Good.

626
00:41:40,595 --> 00:41:42,472
Madelyn.

627
00:41:42,513 --> 00:41:43,973
From now on,

628
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:46,184
no more secrets.

629
00:41:48,186 --> 00:41:49,770
Promise me.

630
00:41:49,812 --> 00:41:52,440
I promise.

631
00:41:52,482 --> 00:41:54,066
No more secrets.

632
00:41:55,109 --> 00:41:56,903
Okay.

633
00:42:00,364 --> 00:42:03,451
I'm sorry that I didn't
tell you about your baby.

634
00:42:05,578 --> 00:42:06,996
It's just that...

635
00:42:07,038 --> 00:42:09,874
you carry so much, and...

636
00:42:11,918 --> 00:42:14,754
the pain of losing a child to...

637
00:42:14,795 --> 00:42:16,839
miscarriage is...

638
00:42:18,925 --> 00:42:21,135
I just wanted
to spare you that burden.

639
00:42:21,177 --> 00:42:23,429
Do you understand?

640
00:42:23,471 --> 00:42:25,473
Yes.

641
00:42:53,042 --> 00:42:54,418
What the fuck?!

642
00:43:04,095 --> 00:43:06,138
Hey, easy with him, man.

643
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:09,183
Fuck wrong with you? Shit.

644
00:43:09,225 --> 00:43:12,103
Bitch ass.

645
00:43:12,144 --> 00:43:13,521
You okay? You break any bones?

646
00:43:13,563 --> 00:43:14,897
- No, no. No.
- No?

647
00:43:14,939 --> 00:43:16,274
Did they get Butcher, too?

648
00:43:16,315 --> 00:43:18,401
- No.
- They got you separated?

649
00:43:18,442 --> 00:43:19,902
When? When?

650
00:43:19,944 --> 00:43:21,279
Well, um,

651
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,364
he went after Homelander.

652
00:43:23,406 --> 00:43:24,657
But I...

653
00:43:24,699 --> 00:43:26,951
I came to save you.

654
00:43:26,993 --> 00:43:29,829
Yay.

655
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:33,165
So, you came here?
You meant to come here?

656
00:43:33,207 --> 00:43:35,084
- Without Butcher.
- Yeah.

657
00:43:36,127 --> 00:43:37,962
C'est incroyable.

658
00:43:39,672 --> 00:43:41,090
Oh...

659
00:43:43,092 --> 00:43:45,303
Never has a man
thrown his life away so...

660
00:43:45,344 --> 00:43:47,155
completely like
you've thrown yours away today.

661
00:43:47,179 --> 00:43:49,056
No...

662
00:43:49,098 --> 00:43:51,726
no, what I mean is,
you rescuing us

663
00:43:51,767 --> 00:43:54,937
is the most useless,
futile gesture I can think of.

664
00:43:54,979 --> 00:43:56,856
- Yeah, I-I got it.
- Unbelievable.

665
00:43:56,897 --> 00:43:58,649
- All right, so what's the plan?
- Okay.

666
00:43:58,691 --> 00:44:00,276
Okay, um...

667
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:01,861
all right, so they searched me.

668
00:44:01,902 --> 00:44:03,988
Very, very thoroughly.

669
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:07,575
But I managed to Poligrip
in my 12th grade retainer.

670
00:44:07,617 --> 00:44:09,136
- Let me see.
- So it looks like a permanent bridge,

671
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,120
- and it totally worked.
- Shit.

672
00:44:11,162 --> 00:44:13,056
Frenchie, you can pick a lock
with anything, right?

673
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,374
There's premium metal wire
in this thing.

674
00:44:15,416 --> 00:44:17,793
- Come on, take it out.
- Okay, one second.

675
00:44:17,835 --> 00:44:20,588
- Come on, man.
- Spit that bitch out.

676
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,632
It's stuck.

677
00:44:22,673 --> 00:44:24,467
- Okay, okay, stand still.
- Wait, what?

678
00:44:24,508 --> 00:44:25,885
- Stand still. Open.
- What...

679
00:44:25,926 --> 00:44:28,471
Open the mouth...

680
00:44:28,512 --> 00:44:30,097
Come on, get up in there,
Frenchie.

681
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,809
- Just go deeper.
- Just a little deeper.

682
00:44:33,851 --> 00:44:34,870
All right, all right, all right,
h-h-hold...

683
00:44:34,894 --> 00:44:36,062
whoa, whoa, whoa.

684
00:44:36,103 --> 00:44:37,313
What the fuck, man?

685
00:44:37,355 --> 00:44:39,148
Let me get this.
Let me get this.

686
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:41,108
Relax, okay?

687
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:44,278
- Look. Look, focus. Focus.
- Okay, okay. What?

688
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,631
I'm-a knock that bitch
out your mouth.

689
00:44:45,655 --> 00:44:47,448
- Okay?
- We're not at that step yet.

690
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:48,949
We don't have to do that.

691
00:44:48,991 --> 00:44:50,385
It's just gonna sting
a little bit. A'ight?

692
00:44:50,409 --> 00:44:51,911
- Sting?
- On three.

693
00:44:51,952 --> 00:44:53,764
- One to three.
- Okay, well, if you count down...

694
00:44:53,788 --> 00:44:56,207
You all right?

695
00:44:56,248 --> 00:44:57,583
You okay, buddy?

696
00:44:57,625 --> 00:44:59,543
- Yes.
- Yes!

697
00:44:59,585 --> 00:45:01,587
Good job, Hughie.

698
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,695
Good night, Ms. Stillwell.

699
00:45:25,736 --> 00:45:27,113
Good night, Miles.

700
00:45:28,698 --> 00:45:30,574
Maria.

701
00:45:34,453 --> 00:45:36,706
Maria, I'm home.

702
00:45:39,709 --> 00:45:41,210
Maria?

703
00:45:41,252 --> 00:45:43,337
Your kid's a sound sleeper.

704
00:45:52,263 --> 00:45:53,848
Don't worry.

705
00:45:53,889 --> 00:45:56,016
He's all right.

706
00:45:56,058 --> 00:45:57,727
So's the nanny.

707
00:45:57,768 --> 00:46:00,646
She's out the back sleeping off
a little bit of propofol.

708
00:46:03,691 --> 00:46:05,276
Put your phone on the table.

709
00:46:21,292 --> 00:46:23,127
William Butcher.

710
00:46:25,671 --> 00:46:27,882
CIA showed me your file.

711
00:46:29,925 --> 00:46:32,011
- What do you want?
- You know what I want.

712
00:46:32,052 --> 00:46:34,472
I don't know how
breaking into my home

713
00:46:34,513 --> 00:46:37,475
and threatening my child
is gonna get you Homelander.

714
00:46:37,516 --> 00:46:39,018
All these years...

715
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:41,479
I've been searching
for that cunt's weakness.

716
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,481
He doesn't have any weakness.

717
00:46:43,522 --> 00:46:45,983
- No?
- There isn't a weapon on Earth

718
00:46:46,025 --> 00:46:47,985
that they haven't thrown at him.

719
00:46:48,027 --> 00:46:49,570
They've all failed.

720
00:46:49,612 --> 00:46:51,822
That's not
what I'm talking about.

721
00:46:53,282 --> 00:46:56,619
I'm talking... about you.

722
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,454
Me?

723
00:46:58,496 --> 00:47:01,999
Yeah, you're the only thing
he gives two shits about.

724
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:05,127
You're his weakness.

725
00:47:13,052 --> 00:47:14,929
It's a fucking maze.

726
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:16,597
Where is she?

727
00:47:21,811 --> 00:47:23,854
Ready... go on.

728
00:47:31,821 --> 00:47:33,948
Mon coeur.

729
00:47:33,989 --> 00:47:35,741
Frenchie, what the fuck?

730
00:47:52,383 --> 00:47:54,426
Fuck! Move. Move.

731
00:48:06,564 --> 00:48:08,107
Fuck.

732
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:14,947
- No! God.
- Just stay down.

733
00:48:23,289 --> 00:48:25,666
Aw, fuck.

734
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:27,751
She better be fucking worth it.

735
00:48:27,793 --> 00:48:29,461
Wait, what?

736
00:48:29,503 --> 00:48:31,171
- You cover him. Cover him!
- Wait, what?

737
00:48:31,213 --> 00:48:32,732
No, I don't... I don't...
I can't do this.

738
00:48:32,756 --> 00:48:34,508
You just pull the fucking
trigger right now!

739
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:36,844
Okay!

740
00:48:36,886 --> 00:48:38,846
Sorry! I'm sorry!

741
00:48:41,807 --> 00:48:43,350
Shit, it's out, it's out.
What do I do?

742
00:48:43,392 --> 00:48:45,352
Take this. Take it.

743
00:48:45,394 --> 00:48:47,163
- Reload.
- What the fuck do I know about reloading?

744
00:48:47,187 --> 00:48:48,856
Reload the magazine.

745
00:48:48,898 --> 00:48:51,066
How do I do that? Okay.

746
00:48:51,108 --> 00:48:52,818
- Let's go.
- Good? It's good.

747
00:48:59,074 --> 00:49:02,286
M.M.! M.M.!

748
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:08,709
M.M.!

749
00:49:10,794 --> 00:49:11,794
Go!

750
00:49:23,974 --> 00:49:27,061
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

751
00:49:27,102 --> 00:49:29,563
I'm out.

752
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,169
- Oh, shit.
- Drop your weapon! -Get down!

753
00:49:34,193 --> 00:49:35,545
- Okay, okay, okay. Okay.
- On your knees.

754
00:49:35,569 --> 00:49:37,297
- Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
- On your fucking knees!

755
00:49:37,321 --> 00:49:39,323
Face the wall!

756
00:49:39,365 --> 00:49:41,909
Hands on your heads!

757
00:50:26,996 --> 00:50:28,872
You came.

758
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:33,460
Like you said...

759
00:50:35,129 --> 00:50:37,631
I'm a fucking superhero.

760
00:50:39,508 --> 00:50:42,636
Come on.

761
00:50:42,678 --> 00:50:44,638
Hughie, check the doors.

762
00:50:46,515 --> 00:50:47,891
Is it working?

763
00:50:47,933 --> 00:50:49,518
- No, no, no, um...
- Fuck.

764
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,895
Try this.

765
00:50:51,937 --> 00:50:54,231
Yes.

766
00:50:56,358 --> 00:50:57,943
- Son of a...
- Go, go, go.

767
00:50:57,985 --> 00:51:01,488
- Go. Go, go, go.
- Holy shit.

768
00:51:04,158 --> 00:51:06,118
Oh, shit. Go.

769
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,371
- Hughie, let's go.
- Go! I'll be okay. Go.

770
00:51:15,294 --> 00:51:17,755
Homelander was right.

771
00:51:19,006 --> 00:51:21,592
You are a fucking rat.

772
00:51:23,927 --> 00:51:26,722
Oh, and you're the jailbreaker?

773
00:51:26,764 --> 00:51:29,683
Are you fucking kidding me?

774
00:51:29,725 --> 00:51:32,102
Turn around and walk away,
A-Train.

775
00:51:34,063 --> 00:51:35,481
I got this. Go.

776
00:51:35,522 --> 00:51:38,484
No. I'm the one he wants.

777
00:51:38,525 --> 00:51:40,527
I'm not leaving you.

778
00:51:49,703 --> 00:51:52,664
Please, just go.

779
00:52:54,685 --> 00:52:56,687
Hughie!

780
00:52:56,728 --> 00:53:00,482
You killed the only person
I've ever loved.

781
00:53:00,524 --> 00:53:03,360
I didn't kill her.

782
00:53:07,698 --> 00:53:09,700
I know.

783
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,162
I did.

784
00:53:22,045 --> 00:53:24,214
But it was your fault.

785
00:53:47,279 --> 00:53:49,156
Holy shit.

786
00:53:49,198 --> 00:53:51,200
What? What?

787
00:53:52,618 --> 00:53:56,496
I-I think he's having
a heart attack.

788
00:54:02,961 --> 00:54:04,838
Oh, fuck.

789
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,840
All right.

790
00:54:09,968 --> 00:54:13,347
One, two, three.

791
00:54:13,388 --> 00:54:15,349
Call an ambulance.

792
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:17,309
One...

793
00:54:17,351 --> 00:54:19,519
He'll never stop coming for you.

794
00:54:19,561 --> 00:54:21,688
I know.

795
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:28,403
This is Starlight.

796
00:54:28,445 --> 00:54:31,323
I have a code 78-65.
A-Train is down.

797
00:54:31,365 --> 00:54:34,159
I think he's had a heart attack.

798
00:54:36,245 --> 00:54:38,247
You have to go. I'll take over.

799
00:54:40,249 --> 00:54:42,042
Hughie, go!

800
00:54:42,084 --> 00:54:44,086
Or else you'll get caught.

801
00:55:26,169 --> 00:55:28,630
Well, well, well.

802
00:55:28,672 --> 00:55:31,383
About fucking time.

803
00:55:33,135 --> 00:55:35,637
I know you can see
through the ceiling.

804
00:55:36,888 --> 00:55:40,267
You try to kill me...

805
00:55:40,309 --> 00:55:43,687
and my trigger finger goes soft.

806
00:55:43,729 --> 00:55:49,568
Now... why don't you stop
playing rapey Santa...

807
00:55:49,609 --> 00:55:51,611
and come down and join us?

808
00:55:58,618 --> 00:56:00,412
Take it easy.

809
00:56:00,454 --> 00:56:02,581
We don't want
to upset Teddy, right?

810
00:56:02,622 --> 00:56:04,583
What are you doing?

811
00:56:04,624 --> 00:56:06,293
Hey, look: Mommy.

812
00:56:06,335 --> 00:56:07,294
You all right?

813
00:56:07,336 --> 00:56:08,879
- No.
- Madelyn...

814
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,880
Take him upstairs.

815
00:56:09,921 --> 00:56:11,882
All good. I got it.

816
00:56:11,923 --> 00:56:14,009
I got it.

817
00:56:20,057 --> 00:56:22,017
Billy Butcher.

818
00:56:22,059 --> 00:56:25,103
You don't mind
if I call you Billy, right?

819
00:56:25,145 --> 00:56:27,105
Y-You are
pretty darn impressive.

820
00:56:27,147 --> 00:56:31,985
I mean, especially for,
you know, one of you.

821
00:56:32,027 --> 00:56:35,781
See, even now, most people
standing where-where you are

822
00:56:35,822 --> 00:56:38,367
would be pissing their pants
terrified, but you...

823
00:56:38,408 --> 00:56:43,914
uh, sure, y-your heart's
pounding, but you're not afraid.

824
00:56:45,374 --> 00:56:46,750
It's anger.

825
00:56:46,792 --> 00:56:48,627
That's a new one for me.

826
00:56:48,668 --> 00:56:52,547
Homelander, will you please
take the baby upstairs?

827
00:56:52,589 --> 00:56:56,718
All because
of your lovely wife Becca.

828
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,136
Right?

829
00:56:58,178 --> 00:57:00,347
Okay. Let's cut
the bullshit, huh?

830
00:57:00,389 --> 00:57:02,391
You know that we, uh...

831
00:57:02,432 --> 00:57:06,186
Uh, bro, not my fault, okay?

832
00:57:06,228 --> 00:57:08,772
- She came on to me. It happens.
- Will you stop?

833
00:57:08,814 --> 00:57:10,583
- You know, it's-it's the fame.
- They get crushes.

834
00:57:10,607 --> 00:57:12,150
There's nothing
I can do about it.

835
00:57:12,192 --> 00:57:15,821
But what I will tell you is,
she was a hell of a lay.

836
00:57:15,862 --> 00:57:17,406
Oh!

837
00:57:17,447 --> 00:57:19,408
She came three times, eh?

838
00:57:19,449 --> 00:57:20,992
Three times.

839
00:57:21,034 --> 00:57:23,453
All right, little man,
have a little lie-down.

840
00:57:23,495 --> 00:57:24,996
Good boy.

841
00:57:25,038 --> 00:57:26,790
I want you to take him
out of here.

842
00:57:26,832 --> 00:57:28,375
There you go.

843
00:57:32,838 --> 00:57:34,923
But that's not really it.

844
00:57:34,965 --> 00:57:36,925
No, no, no, no, no.

845
00:57:37,968 --> 00:57:40,595
No, it's more than just that.

846
00:57:43,098 --> 00:57:47,436
You think I'm responsible
for her death, don't you?

847
00:57:47,477 --> 00:57:49,146
So now

848
00:57:49,187 --> 00:57:54,484
you have a hostage
that-that I care about, right?

849
00:57:54,526 --> 00:57:56,445
Someone I love.

850
00:57:56,486 --> 00:58:01,116
So, what's your plan...
from here?

851
00:58:01,158 --> 00:58:02,534
Uh, what do you want?

852
00:58:02,576 --> 00:58:04,870
Do you want a confession, or...

853
00:58:04,911 --> 00:58:06,997
What's your endgame?

854
00:58:12,669 --> 00:58:16,256
I'm just gonna hurt you.

855
00:58:16,298 --> 00:58:19,968
I mean really fucking hurt you,

856
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:22,179
and that will be
good enough for me.

857
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:26,349
So, y-you don't really want
anything, per se?

858
00:58:26,391 --> 00:58:29,895
You just, you want to blow her
up in front of me.

859
00:58:29,936 --> 00:58:31,605
Right?

860
00:58:31,646 --> 00:58:35,317
Wow, fuck.

861
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:39,905
Uh...

862
00:58:39,946 --> 00:58:43,366
You are dark,
and I kind of like it.

863
00:58:43,408 --> 00:58:45,827
Will you please
take Teddy upstairs?

864
00:58:45,869 --> 00:58:49,372
It's okay.

865
00:58:49,414 --> 00:58:52,667
Just answer one question for me.

866
00:58:52,709 --> 00:58:54,961
Just one.

867
00:58:55,003 --> 00:58:57,005
How do you know?

868
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,467
How do you know?

869
00:59:00,509 --> 00:59:04,304
I mean, you must have
some rock-solid proof, right?

870
00:59:04,346 --> 00:59:08,308
That it was actually me
who killed your wife.

871
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:11,937
You must have that, right?
So what is it?

872
00:59:11,978 --> 00:59:15,607
Share. We're all
very interested.

873
00:59:17,234 --> 00:59:20,070
Now's not the time
to be strong and silent.

874
00:59:20,111 --> 00:59:21,571
Go for it.

875
00:59:23,615 --> 00:59:28,078
Are you telling me
that this whole thing.

876
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:32,499
I-is based on fucking feelings?

877
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:34,292
- On a hunch?
- Will you please

878
00:59:34,334 --> 00:59:36,270
- take him upstairs?
- A little bit... Madelyn, hold on.

879
00:59:36,294 --> 00:59:39,047
- Take him upstairs!
- Shut the fuck up!

880
00:59:43,468 --> 00:59:45,470
Excuse me.

881
00:59:46,721 --> 00:59:49,891
You promised me no more lies.

882
00:59:49,933 --> 00:59:53,562
You fucking promised me.

883
00:59:55,146 --> 00:59:59,276
You and Vogelbaum should have
got your stories straight.

884
00:59:59,317 --> 01:00:01,278
They were so close.

885
01:00:01,319 --> 01:00:04,823
So fucking close, but there
was a few little details

886
01:00:04,864 --> 01:00:07,367
that were different.

887
01:00:07,409 --> 01:00:09,578
So I went back to Vogelbaum,

888
01:00:09,619 --> 01:00:13,164
and I managed to squeeze
the truth out of him.

889
01:00:13,206 --> 01:00:15,500
The real truth.

890
01:00:18,628 --> 01:00:22,173
Yes, that's it.

891
01:00:29,848 --> 01:00:31,808
I'm so sorry.

892
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:34,811
I should never have lied to you.

893
01:00:34,853 --> 01:00:38,815
I know now that you don't need
to be protected.

894
01:00:38,857 --> 01:00:40,817
I'm so sorry.

895
01:00:40,859 --> 01:00:43,320
Will you please
take Teddy upstairs?

896
01:00:47,032 --> 01:00:49,868
Did you ever really care
about me?

897
01:00:49,909 --> 01:00:51,536
You mean everything to me.

898
01:00:51,578 --> 01:00:53,538
No.

899
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:54,873
No, no.

900
01:00:54,914 --> 01:00:57,917
I mean everything to your job.

901
01:00:59,544 --> 01:01:01,504
You care more
about that fucking baby

902
01:01:01,546 --> 01:01:03,214
- than you do about me.
- No.

903
01:01:03,256 --> 01:01:05,216
I love you.

904
01:01:05,258 --> 01:01:07,594
I love you. I love you.
I swear I love you.

905
01:01:07,636 --> 01:01:10,180
But?

906
01:01:10,221 --> 01:01:14,517
Tell me the truth,
or I walk out right now.

907
01:01:18,563 --> 01:01:20,565
I'm scared.

908
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:24,152
I'm scared of you.

909
01:01:26,154 --> 01:01:27,614
What?

910
01:01:27,656 --> 01:01:29,449
I said I'm scared.

911
01:01:29,491 --> 01:01:32,118
- Of?
- Of you.

912
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,829
I'm scared of you.

913
01:01:34,871 --> 01:01:37,332
Thank you.

914
01:01:38,333 --> 01:01:41,753
Thank you
for finally being honest.

915
01:02:32,011 --> 01:02:34,013
Now...

916
01:02:36,391 --> 01:02:39,352
what was that plan again?

917
01:02:40,395 --> 01:02:42,731
Oh, well...

918
01:03:06,671 --> 01:03:09,299
Wakey, wakey.

919
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:11,301
Hey, buddy.

920
01:03:11,342 --> 01:03:13,595
You were out for quite a while.

921
01:03:13,636 --> 01:03:16,556
You can thank me for, uh,
saving you sometime later,

922
01:03:16,598 --> 01:03:18,850
but, for now,

923
01:03:18,892 --> 01:03:19,976
time to get up.

924
01:03:20,018 --> 01:03:21,728
Come on. You're gonna love this.

925
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:23,772
Come on.

926
01:03:28,067 --> 01:03:29,360
Mom!

927
01:03:29,402 --> 01:03:32,405
Wow,
look at this handsome devil.

928
01:03:34,407 --> 01:03:36,993
Hey, pal.

929
01:03:37,035 --> 01:03:38,536
You know who I am?

930
01:03:38,578 --> 01:03:40,079
Homelander.

931
01:03:40,121 --> 01:03:43,082
Yeah, that's right, but...

932
01:03:45,001 --> 01:03:46,961
you know who else?

933
01:03:47,003 --> 01:03:48,755
No.

934
01:03:54,886 --> 01:03:56,846
Becca?

935
01:03:56,888 --> 01:03:58,932
- What?
- Huh.

936
01:03:58,973 --> 01:04:00,975
Mommy didn't tell you.

937
01:04:02,977 --> 01:04:04,979
Well...

938
01:04:08,525 --> 01:04:10,485
I'm your father,

939
01:04:10,527 --> 01:04:15,406
and we are a family.
