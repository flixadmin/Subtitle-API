SWEET HOME

4
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,940
[Hyun-su] I think I've finally
started to understand you.

5
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,447
I was always mocking you...

6
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,284
but now I'm stuck in your shoes.

To save Eun-hyeok?

13
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,928
Even from letting Eun-yu live,

14
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:38,056
all the way to that ridiculous bet
that we've made about you.

15
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,895
There are other things
I'm sure you'd do too.

16
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,070
You asked who I was.

17
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,449
Since the very beginning...

18
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,580
I was always you.

19
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,376
I've always been within you.

20
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,630

I'm sure you are.

26
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,066
Like I always was.

27
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,577
I wonder, if we become one...

28
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,833

Mm.

Then we should too. Let's go.

Remember that elephant slide?

55
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,170
It had a hole in the middle of it.

56
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,965
[sighs] If you hid in there,
no one could see you at all.

57
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,094
You hid there every time
we played hide-and-seek.

58
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,138
I would look for you until you cried.

Do you know how I ended up
finding that hole?

Remember when we were playing and
I got distracted by our neighbor's dog,

61
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,648
and its leash suddenly broke,
so I raced after it?

62
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,110
And then you popped out of the slide.

63
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:02,945
And I caught you.

You can learn.

If you have memories,
you can learn emotions.

70
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,589
Then you shouldn't lie about it.

71
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,008
You untied the dog.

72
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,428
You felt bad for it.
The leash didn't snap.

I guess your ankle's doing better.

00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,509
You'll find out soon enough.

169
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,636
You aren't locked up here.

170
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,722
We're protecting you.

Damn.

Ugh, what took you so long?

180
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,845
Sang-won talks a lot, doesn't he?

181
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,306
I couldn't just wait around forever.

Are you ready?

[Dr. Lim] Oh.

189
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,333
Don't tell Sang-won about this.

190
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:59,213
He doesn't know that his little minions
were made with this stuff too.

191
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,381
If he finds out...

192
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,758
[breathes deeply]
...he'll lose it.

193

By the way,

194
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,973
what did Sang-won want?

195
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,267
[In-hwan] The child's missing.

00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,565
How did she manage to escape?

199
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,944
Apparently, she can
turn people into monsters.

Well, how did it go?

206
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,523
Did you find the kid?

Who can do what?

212
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,625
- You weren't aware of this?
- Wait, wait a second.

[Dr. Lim shuddering]

218
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,108
Sergeant Tak, I'm sorry.

219
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,110
But I think

220
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,821
I'll have to save this for later.

221
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,701
I think there's a more suitable
test subject out there.

222
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,328
What?

223
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,041
I was saving this for myself.

224
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,921
It would've been mine
if I'd just shown symptoms.

225
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:07,424
And yet, those goddamn symptoms
always kept passing me, and why?

226
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,844
Nearly everyone got it, so why not me?

227
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,348
[Dr. Lim chuckles]

228
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:21,146
I was ready to give it up
for the sake of humanity.

229

Now that I'm pursuing a good cause,

Oh, shit. What? Wait!

Oh.

[Sang-wook] Why are you here,
and not looking for the kid?

Do you not care anymore
because you're symptomatic?

[Sang-wook scoffs] Seriously?

You still can't let go of that?

272
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,896
[In-hwan] I heard you were
gonna take over the child's body

00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,022
once she's found.

274

My friend can be a blabbermouth.

That's not true.

276

He made them with your blood!

Maybe that's why
they were so loyal to you.

You really didn't know?

I thought you were pretending not to know.

283
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,309
Honestly, I never thought
you'd be fooled by him.

What?

287
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,403
I was just disappointed.

288
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,365
I thought I'd get the opportunity too.

289
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,331
Are you saying you'll join me
after all this?

There is only one more vial of your blood.

It was in Ja-yeong's stomach
and he took it out.

And then, what?

295
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,392
Dr. Lim ate it himself.

You have a strong look,

We shouldn't have gone.

It's my fault that those monsters
came in here too.

I'm symptomatic.

334
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,894
It started even before
I sent you to Bamseom.

335
