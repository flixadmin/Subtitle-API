1
00:00:00,047 --> 00:00:01,840
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:01,865 --> 00:00:04,084
After 6 years of being a vigilante,

3
00:00:04,109 --> 00:00:05,768
the only way to achieve my goal

4
00:00:05,793 --> 00:00:09,359
and save my city was to confess
to being the Green Arrow.

5
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:13,061
Now my family and friends must
carry on my mission without me.

6
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:15,082
I am no longer a hero.

7
00:00:15,664 --> 00:00:18,845
I am inmate 4587.

8
00:00:19,547 --> 00:00:20,641
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:22,191
You hired those prisoners

10
00:00:22,216 --> 00:00:24,561
to attack me in the shower for Diaz.

11
00:00:24,586 --> 00:00:26,830
So why don't you tell
me how I can find him?

12
00:00:26,855 --> 00:00:28,904
You got to prove yourself
worthy of my friendship.

13
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:29,885
What do you want?

14
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,717
I want him gone.

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,894
You stabbed me.

16
00:00:35,919 --> 00:00:37,140
- I didn't stab you.
- Get away from him.

17
00:00:37,165 --> 00:00:39,206
The video! That guard stabbed me.
He stabbed me!

18
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:41,281
I didn't! I didn't do anything!

19
00:00:42,172 --> 00:00:43,681
You made a deal with my husband.

20
00:00:43,714 --> 00:00:45,511
And he's in prison because of it.

21
00:00:45,536 --> 00:00:48,870
Now it's your turn to hold
up your side of the bargain.

22
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:52,183
We're gonna take down
Ricardo Diaz together.

_

25
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:34,706
You promised the FBI
would stay in Star City

26
00:01:34,731 --> 00:01:36,016
until Diaz was off the board.

27
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,582
And as you can see, we're still here.

28
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:38,973
Yeah, but you haven't caught him.

29
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,108
Apprehending Diaz is still a priority,

30
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:43,144
but he's not the only
criminal on our list.

31
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,800
- Let me help.
- Excuse me?

32
00:01:44,825 --> 00:01:46,677
You've seen what I can do
with the tck, tck. Heh.

33
00:01:46,702 --> 00:01:48,191
We have our own experts, Ms. Smoak.

34
00:01:48,216 --> 00:01:49,618
But not as expert as me.

35
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:51,776
I know everything there
is to know about Diaz

36
00:01:51,801 --> 00:01:53,306
and the Longbow Hunters.

37
00:01:53,331 --> 00:01:55,316
Yeah! They're here, too.

38
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:57,002
Diaz brought in the bad guy big guns,

39
00:01:57,027 --> 00:01:58,793
which means you don't have
any more time to waste.

40
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,054
So give me a computer
and put me to work.

41
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:03,699
My agreement with your husband,

42
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:04,818
it gives you immunity.

43
00:02:04,843 --> 00:02:06,480
It doesn't make us allies.

44
00:02:06,505 --> 00:02:09,173
Diaz attacked me while I
was in protective custody.

45
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,819
My husband is in prison.

46
00:02:10,844 --> 00:02:12,418
I had to send my son away.

47
00:02:12,443 --> 00:02:14,260
Your deal with Oliver

48
00:02:14,285 --> 00:02:17,070
ruined my life and the city's.

49
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,813
All I'm asking of you is to hold up

50
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,375
your side of the bargain.

51
00:02:23,499 --> 00:02:25,103
I'm sorry you were attacked,

52
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,297
but it's not my fault
your husband's in prison.

53
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:29,029
It was his choice to put on that hood,

54
00:02:29,054 --> 00:02:31,002
and it was his choice
to turn himself in.

55
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:33,915
Go home. Enjoy your freedom.

56
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:36,164
Leave the crime fighting to me.

57
00:02:39,738 --> 00:02:43,731
My husband spent the last 6 years

58
00:02:43,756 --> 00:02:45,601
fighting for the people of this city,

59
00:02:45,626 --> 00:02:46,785
risking everything,

60
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,191
and now he sits in prison,
his life on the line,

61
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,395
while this monster gets to walk free.

62
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,394
That isn't justice.

63
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:06,429
Wow. I still can't believe
you stabbed yourself.

64
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:08,459
Did you hit anything big,

65
00:03:08,484 --> 00:03:10,170
like your liver or something?

66
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:13,096
Right. You probably don't
even have a liver,

67
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:14,496
just muscle.

68
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:16,781
You think I had any other choice?

69
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:30,200
I did what you asked.

70
00:03:30,225 --> 00:03:32,628
Now tell me what you know about Diaz.

71
00:03:32,653 --> 00:03:34,260
That wasn't exactly what I meant

72
00:03:34,285 --> 00:03:35,344
by getting rid of Yorke.

73
00:03:35,369 --> 00:03:37,043
Well, I found a better way.

74
00:03:37,355 --> 00:03:39,024
Heh! He still thinks he's a hero.

75
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:40,941
You're a bigger idiot than I thought.

76
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:42,715
Easy, gents. A deal's a deal.

77
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,248
Getting Yorke off our back
means we're in business.

78
00:03:45,798 --> 00:03:48,223
Thanks to Queen here, we're gonna have

79
00:03:48,248 --> 00:03:49,558
one hell of a night.

80
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,029
Where is Diaz?

81
00:03:51,054 --> 00:03:54,287
I don't know, but I do know who does.

82
00:03:54,793 --> 00:03:57,574
There's an informant here at slabside.

83
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,197
Anything that goes on here
goes through the Demon first.

84
00:04:03,058 --> 00:04:05,216
- The Demon?
- Yeah.

85
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:07,135
The person who arranged the hit on you

86
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,583
and who's the direct
connection to Diaz.

87
00:04:09,608 --> 00:04:11,856
All I did was handle the transaction,

88
00:04:12,136 --> 00:04:15,344
but seeing as how I'm a man of my word,

89
00:04:15,369 --> 00:04:17,066
I will arrange the meeting.

90
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,605
You really expect me to trust you?

91
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,791
You don't have much
choice, now, do you?

92
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:22,806
When?

93
00:04:22,831 --> 00:04:27,079
Tonight, Cell 3-B after lights out.

94
00:04:30,748 --> 00:04:33,134
And you will know when.

95
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:41,673
Stall all you want.

96
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:43,678
Eventually you're gonna break.

97
00:04:44,393 --> 00:04:46,959
And when you do, I'll be right here.

98
00:04:47,864 --> 00:04:51,536
Last chance before I bring her in.

99
00:04:56,758 --> 00:05:00,067
Did you or did you not eat
this entire box of cookies?

100
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:04,521
It's OK, honey.

101
00:05:04,546 --> 00:05:06,651
You just got a little
hungry, didn't you?

102
00:05:07,105 --> 00:05:09,045
Now you have a tummy-ache.

103
00:05:09,398 --> 00:05:10,664
Well, now we know what happens when we

104
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:12,484
eat too much sugar, right?

105
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:16,242
Come on. Let's go say hi to Ella.

106
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:17,464
She has lots of fun stuff planned

107
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:19,434
while dad and I are out of town.

108
00:05:20,181 --> 00:05:21,790
I was working on him for 20 minutes.

109
00:05:21,815 --> 00:05:23,759
You get him to confess in 15 seconds?

110
00:05:23,784 --> 00:05:26,500
I'm his mother and your boss.

111
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:28,036
We leave in 5.

112
00:05:28,845 --> 00:05:30,514
Yeah, packed and ready.

113
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:33,563
Oh. You don't sound
too happy about that.

114
00:05:33,588 --> 00:05:35,345
I just wish we would've caught Diaz

115
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,563
before heading abroad.

116
00:05:36,588 --> 00:05:37,887
- We will.
- Yeah.

117
00:05:37,912 --> 00:05:40,283
And Felicity will be fine, I promise.

118
00:05:40,845 --> 00:05:42,895
I think you could use
a change of scenery.

119
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,886
It'll be like a second honeymoon.

120
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,595
Yay, with Curtis.

121
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:49,896
Well, Deadshot and Cupid
came with us on our first.

122
00:05:49,921 --> 00:05:51,564
No, that is not our first honeymoon.

123
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:54,720
Our first honeymoon was
in Hawaii, remember?

124
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:56,891
The hammocks by the beach.

125
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,371
- Hawaii was nice.
- Hawaii was really nice.

126
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,779
You know, I thought it'd be a lot
more difficult working with you.

127
00:06:01,804 --> 00:06:03,130
Being together 24/7?

128
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,340
But adventure was always
what kept us strong.

129
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,183
- Dangerous ops.
- Romance on the front line.

130
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,868
- We make a good team.
- We make the best team.

131
00:06:18,937 --> 00:06:21,299
Ricardo Diaz took over a whole city.

132
00:06:21,324 --> 00:06:23,405
Then we dismantled his infrastructure.

133
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,832
He's not an imminent threat.

134
00:06:24,857 --> 00:06:26,376
He's got new allies.

135
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:28,765
One of them hacked into
the CDC's secure network,

136
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,767
specifically their security protocols.

137
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:32,088
They're planning something.

138
00:06:32,113 --> 00:06:33,924
You deduced that from this photograph

139
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:35,657
and one unsubstantiated hack?

140
00:06:35,682 --> 00:06:37,782
It's the only lead we got
in months, and you know it.

141
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:39,138
We can't let that slip away.

142
00:06:39,163 --> 00:06:41,618
Then bring me something
concrete I can act on.

143
00:06:41,643 --> 00:06:43,967
CDC's security system is airtight.

144
00:06:43,992 --> 00:06:46,587
No one gets in without a
level 5 security clearance.

145
00:06:47,108 --> 00:06:48,876
I can't waste valuable resources

146
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:50,831
on something this circumstantial.

147
00:06:50,856 --> 00:06:52,478
You mean someone who
dropped to number 27

148
00:06:52,503 --> 00:06:53,937
on our most wanted list.

149
00:06:53,962 --> 00:06:55,416
That, too.

150
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:56,918
Tell the CDC they've been hacked.

151
00:06:56,943 --> 00:06:58,759
They can handle it as they see fit.

152
00:06:59,438 --> 00:07:02,273
I need your focus elsewhere, Agent.

153
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:11,272
I guess her heart isn't
completely made out of stone.

154
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:12,897
Bugging the FBI...

155
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,388
Maybe not the best move
for our immunity deal.

156
00:07:15,413 --> 00:07:16,976
I'm going with the ask for forgiveness

157
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:19,222
instead of permission type thing.

158
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:21,813
When you said you were done
with the A.R.G.U.S. way,

159
00:07:21,838 --> 00:07:22,743
you weren't joking.

160
00:07:22,768 --> 00:07:26,372
John has priorities other
than catching Diaz. I don't.

161
00:07:26,397 --> 00:07:28,470
I really appreciate you wanting to help

162
00:07:28,607 --> 00:07:31,066
and letting me sleep on your couch,

163
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:32,596
which is a lot more
comfortable than it looks.

164
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:35,211
I've been dying to get
the band back together

165
00:07:35,236 --> 00:07:37,278
and get that son of a bitch Diaz.

166
00:07:37,606 --> 00:07:39,459
What's he want at the CDC?

167
00:07:39,484 --> 00:07:41,080
Finding that out is the easy part.

168
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:42,506
What's the hard part?

169
00:07:42,735 --> 00:07:44,483
Getting into the CDC.

170
00:07:44,945 --> 00:07:46,523
You heard the boss man.

171
00:07:46,548 --> 00:07:49,953
The only way we get in there
is with Federal clearance.

172
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:40,225
Where are all the guards?
What the hell is happening?

173
00:08:40,323 --> 00:08:41,707
No idea.

174
00:08:42,373 --> 00:08:45,703
Brick has something planned.
Just stay here.

175
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:49,064
Where you going?

176
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:50,679
I need to find someone.

177
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,271
I'm gonna come.

178
00:08:52,296 --> 00:08:54,819
Hey, your cell is the safest
spot for you right now.

179
00:08:55,163 --> 00:08:56,671
With all these murdery
guys on the loose,

180
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:58,552
I'm sticking right by your side.

181
00:09:00,188 --> 00:09:01,680
Fine.

182
00:09:13,663 --> 00:09:15,884
That's a lot of firepower for a bank.

183
00:09:15,924 --> 00:09:18,291
They need it. Half of
Europe's criminal underworld

184
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,593
funnels their money through here.

185
00:09:19,618 --> 00:09:20,906
Guessing that's a shoot first,

186
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:23,178
ask questions never kind of bank?

187
00:09:23,205 --> 00:09:25,974
Which is why they can't find
out that we're with A.R.G.U.S.

188
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,329
Oh. which they won't because of...

189
00:09:28,647 --> 00:09:30,136
This.

190
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:32,653
I printed it to be completely
identical to the real one,

191
00:09:32,678 --> 00:09:34,459
except for the nanotech-laced paint

192
00:09:34,484 --> 00:09:35,252
which allows us

193
00:09:35,277 --> 00:09:37,095
to access the bank's
financial transactions.

194
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,804
Heh heh. That's a Curtis Holt original.

195
00:09:40,594 --> 00:09:42,527
I mean, come on. That's
pretty cool, right?

196
00:09:42,552 --> 00:09:44,096
Well, hopefully, it's
enough to fool 'em.

197
00:09:44,121 --> 00:09:45,863
Well, it only needs to fool him...

198
00:09:45,888 --> 00:09:46,746
Peter Tietjen.

199
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:48,520
He is the Bank Manager.

200
00:09:48,545 --> 00:09:50,105
I have you an appointment
set up with him already.

201
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,617
You get that painting within
5 feet of his computer

202
00:09:52,642 --> 00:09:54,973
and it is dinner party
download time at A.R.G.U.S.

203
00:09:54,998 --> 00:09:56,751
I'm talking an all-you-can-eat buffet

204
00:09:56,776 --> 00:09:59,002
of every name, account,
shady business transaction

205
00:09:59,027 --> 00:10:00,857
that that bank has ever conducted.

206
00:10:00,882 --> 00:10:02,753
Ooh! ooh! Ooh! While
you guys are in there,

207
00:10:02,778 --> 00:10:04,113
can you get me a free toaster?

208
00:10:09,454 --> 00:10:12,332
Mr. and Mrs. Andrews,
thank you for coming in.

209
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:15,167
May I see your reference
letter, please?

210
00:10:24,618 --> 00:10:26,690
This is our reference letter.

211
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:29,090
We need a safe place to store it.

212
00:10:29,152 --> 00:10:31,469
We were told you could handle this...

213
00:10:31,738 --> 00:10:33,581
Discreetly, of course.

214
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:35,848
Of course.

215
00:10:35,873 --> 00:10:37,149
I think you will find our terms

216
00:10:37,174 --> 00:10:38,548
more than reasonable.

217
00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:40,478
That's it! Show me the money.

218
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:43,647
We have uplink.

219
00:10:43,672 --> 00:10:45,776
After signing the requisite forms,

220
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:47,262
all we require is

221
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:49,385
an approval from our
in-house appraiser.

222
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,347
If you'll excuse me.

223
00:10:59,364 --> 00:11:02,381
Tick-tock, Curtis. What's our status?

224
00:11:02,406 --> 00:11:04,422
Zurich, we have a problem.

225
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:05,713
I'm getting external interference,

226
00:11:05,738 --> 00:11:07,496
and it's slowing down the transfer.

227
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,105
This is Sofie, our appraiser.

228
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,160
Is this really necessary?

229
00:11:20,185 --> 00:11:21,829
We must authenticate the item

230
00:11:21,854 --> 00:11:23,366
for insurance purposes.

231
00:11:23,668 --> 00:11:25,393
You understand?

232
00:11:27,404 --> 00:11:30,899
Mr. Tietjen, this is a
priceless family heirloom.

233
00:11:30,932 --> 00:11:33,172
I need to discuss the
security of your vault.

234
00:11:33,197 --> 00:11:34,292
Certainly.

235
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:35,683
We are very experienced

236
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,441
with these types of situations.

237
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,852
I'm shutting down coms to
open bandwidth. Hang tight.

238
00:11:42,754 --> 00:11:44,489
Mr. Tietjen...

239
00:11:49,827 --> 00:11:51,764
Come on.

240
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:54,508
Done! get the hell out of there.

241
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:55,759
This is outrageous.

242
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,571
We're taking our business elsewhere.

243
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,669
Mission accomplished.

244
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,346
If this is illegal, I don't
want to know about it.

245
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:14,220
Aw, D., why you always
got to expect the worst?

246
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,527
You make it easy, Mr. Ramirez.

247
00:12:16,552 --> 00:12:20,043
OK, OK, what the hell is going on here?

248
00:12:20,068 --> 00:12:21,408
We know how to get Diaz,

249
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,151
and we need your help.

250
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:24,399
I thought I made myself clear, Ms.
Smoak.

251
00:12:24,425 --> 00:12:26,695
You did. And then I figured out
how to set a trap at the CDC.

252
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,554
- How did you know about this...
- I bugged your office.

253
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:29,486
- See...
- I know. I know.

254
00:12:29,511 --> 00:12:31,270
But hold the lecture. We're
on a time crunch here.

255
00:12:31,295 --> 00:12:32,748
I backtraced the Silencer's hack.

256
00:12:32,773 --> 00:12:34,416
Wait. we're calling
her the Silencer now?

257
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:36,408
- It's better than the Belt Lady.
- Noted.

258
00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:37,729
She's been checking inventory

259
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:39,585
on glutathione hydrate.

260
00:12:39,747 --> 00:12:41,801
It's a biocompound that helps
protect red blood cells

261
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:43,307
against diseases like Ebola

262
00:12:43,332 --> 00:12:44,363
and the Lassa Fever.

263
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,361
I mean, god knows what creepy thing

264
00:12:46,386 --> 00:12:47,909
Diaz has planned for that,

265
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,220
and the only place he can get it is

266
00:12:49,245 --> 00:12:50,299
the CDC.

267
00:12:50,324 --> 00:12:53,686
You do realize the CDC is a
Secure Government Facility.

268
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:54,885
They have strict protocols, proce...

269
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,652
Which makes it the
perfect place, you know,

270
00:12:56,956 --> 00:12:58,448
to set a trap.

271
00:12:58,473 --> 00:13:00,645
The compound is being stored
in a biocontainment lab.

272
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,440
Diaz walks in there,
I seal the doors...

273
00:13:03,811 --> 00:13:04,651
He's locked in.

274
00:13:04,676 --> 00:13:07,858
Like that zombie movie...
Or any zombie movie.

275
00:13:07,883 --> 00:13:09,394
- And when is this happening?
- Tonight.

276
00:13:09,692 --> 00:13:11,333
A shipment just came
in from Central City.

277
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:12,484
Well, I'll put a team together.

278
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:14,582
If Diaz goes near that building,
the SCPD will be there waiting.

279
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:17,440
If Diaz even gets a whiff of
the police, it'll spook him.

280
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:19,494
Oh, right. You want to
do it the vigilante way.

281
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,751
Well, you probably shouldn't
have invited her.

282
00:13:21,776 --> 00:13:24,946
No Canary, no Wild Dog. Just us.

283
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,509
It technically wouldn't
be off the books

284
00:13:26,534 --> 00:13:27,817
if Agent Watson comes with us.

285
00:13:27,842 --> 00:13:29,588
And go against my boss' direct order

286
00:13:29,613 --> 00:13:30,950
to stay away from the CDC?

287
00:13:30,975 --> 00:13:32,749
Your boss is wrong, and you know it.

288
00:13:32,774 --> 00:13:34,323
Besides, something tells
me if you brought Diaz in,

289
00:13:34,348 --> 00:13:35,783
all would be forgiven.

290
00:13:35,808 --> 00:13:36,985
That's a big "if."

291
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,452
Diaz has been a plague on
this city and on our lives

292
00:13:39,477 --> 00:13:41,040
for too long.

293
00:13:41,065 --> 00:13:42,998
And now we have a chance
to bring him down.

294
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,619
We have to take it.

295
00:13:44,644 --> 00:13:46,309
It's been 5 months.

296
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:48,058
The SCPD hasn't caught him,

297
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,980
neither has the FBI,
neither has A.R.G.U.S.

298
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:52,520
It's time to try another way.

299
00:13:56,727 --> 00:13:58,060
Fine.

300
00:13:58,085 --> 00:14:00,676
But this is a one-time
thing, understand?

301
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:04,675
And if anything feels
off, I pull the plug.

302
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:07,719
What do you say, D.?

303
00:14:10,355 --> 00:14:11,887
All right.

304
00:14:11,912 --> 00:14:14,082
Let's go catch us a dragon.

305
00:14:17,598 --> 00:14:19,678
This is like a horror movie.

306
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:22,468
It's so quiet, I can hear my heartbeat.

307
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:25,529
I'm gonna be the first one taken out.

308
00:14:25,554 --> 00:14:27,294
It would never be you.

309
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:31,655
All right. If you're gonna tag along,

310
00:14:31,966 --> 00:14:33,495
do it a little more quietly.

311
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,987
Right. OK. There's 3-B.

312
00:14:58,927 --> 00:15:00,627
Not here!

313
00:15:01,178 --> 00:15:03,254
So what do we do, just wait?

314
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,412
It'll be a long wait.

315
00:15:07,434 --> 00:15:08,766
Where's the Demon?

316
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:09,938
Hell if I know.

317
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,992
You actually thought Brick
was gonna help you?

318
00:15:14,096 --> 00:15:15,661
Well, Brick got what he wanted,

319
00:15:15,686 --> 00:15:19,994
and now he wants you dead.

320
00:15:51,177 --> 00:15:54,930
You're not going anywhere
until I get some answers.

321
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:06,395
We had a deal!

322
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,362
A deal that means nothing

323
00:16:07,387 --> 00:16:09,226
now that Brick got what he wanted.

324
00:16:09,322 --> 00:16:12,393
With Yorke gone, we're finally
free to have some fun.

325
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:15,235
Brick's got a game going on
right now in the mess hall,

326
00:16:15,317 --> 00:16:17,160
all thanks to you.

327
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:19,075
First rule of prison...

328
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,332
Trust no one.

329
00:16:20,357 --> 00:16:22,560
Ah, the kid's right.

330
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:25,739
Now, how did he manage to
figure that out before you did?

331
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,498
All right. So Brick was lying.
There's no Demon.

332
00:16:28,523 --> 00:16:31,944
Oh, there is, but you
don't summon the Demon.

333
00:16:31,969 --> 00:16:33,415
The Demon summons you.

334
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,114
I think I'll take my chances.

335
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:37,356
You're not getting this.

336
00:16:38,036 --> 00:16:41,362
The only way to the
demon is through Brick.

337
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:43,817
There's a system.

338
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:46,098
That's how this place works.

339
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:49,606
Well, looks like I'm gonna force Brick

340
00:16:49,631 --> 00:16:51,138
to make good on his deal.

341
00:16:51,163 --> 00:16:53,122
Hmm. Good luck.

342
00:16:53,368 --> 00:16:55,137
His party's invite only,

343
00:16:55,162 --> 00:16:58,288
and, uh, you're not on the list.

344
00:17:02,885 --> 00:17:04,809
I'm guessing you are.

345
00:17:12,425 --> 00:17:15,026
Good evening. Amanda Watson, FBI.

346
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:17,051
I'm here to pick up some
security abstracts.

347
00:17:17,284 --> 00:17:18,512
You're working late.

348
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,556
Day got away from me.
You know how it is.

349
00:17:20,671 --> 00:17:22,173
Door to the right. I'll buzz you in.

350
00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:31,314
The biocontainment lab
should be right...

351
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:32,736
Here. This is it.

352
00:17:33,243 --> 00:17:36,417
So all we got to do
is trap them inside?

353
00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:37,399
That's the idea.

354
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:38,898
There's a server room down the hall.

355
00:17:38,923 --> 00:17:40,285
Felicity and I will set up there.

356
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,382
The camera's on a loop.

357
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:43,297
As far as Diaz can tell,
the place will be empty.

358
00:17:43,322 --> 00:17:45,193
We'll cover the exits.

359
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:50,726
This is quite the set-up.

360
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:53,335
Well, the CDC takes their security
a lot more seriously than the FBI.

361
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,606
No offense.

362
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:58,297
None taken. You thought about
getting into cybersecurity legally?

363
00:17:58,322 --> 00:18:00,781
I haven't done legally
in a very long time.

364
00:18:01,174 --> 00:18:04,000
What scared you off? All
that nasty due process?

365
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:05,797
You mean the rolls and
rolls of red tape?

366
00:18:05,822 --> 00:18:08,489
No, I just prefer to spend my
time actually catching criminals.

367
00:18:08,514 --> 00:18:09,862
I know the law isn't perfect.

368
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:11,504
If it were, Diaz would be in
prison, William would be at home,

369
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:13,898
and I wouldn't jump 5 feet
every time I hear a door slam,

370
00:18:13,923 --> 00:18:14,981
but here we are.

371
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:16,230
Just because the system is flawed

372
00:18:16,255 --> 00:18:17,753
doesn't mean it shouldn't exist.

373
00:18:17,778 --> 00:18:19,169
Even someone like Ricardo Diaz

374
00:18:19,194 --> 00:18:21,005
needs a lawyer, a fair trial.

375
00:18:21,387 --> 00:18:23,222
We protect the rights of
people who don't deserve them

376
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:25,066
because it's the only way to
protect them for everyone.

377
00:18:25,091 --> 00:18:27,841
And yet here you are
tonight going off-book.

378
00:18:27,866 --> 00:18:30,047
Well, it's like you said before:

379
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,591
As long as I cuff a bad guy,

380
00:18:31,616 --> 00:18:33,084
all is forgiven, right?

381
00:18:33,685 --> 00:18:36,144
And then we go get justice
the old-fashioned way...

382
00:18:36,653 --> 00:18:37,896
In court.

383
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:39,286
Let's hope.

384
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:43,706
Hey, is Lyla here?

385
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:45,545
No. she stepped out. What's up?

386
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,195
Uh, nothing. Well, OK. Something.

387
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,255
Well, not something-something
necessarily

388
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,692
but probably... Swiss chocolate?

389
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:55,396
Heh! chocolate pralines.

390
00:18:55,421 --> 00:18:56,579
I mean, there's nothing better.

391
00:18:56,604 --> 00:18:58,480
- Curtis.
- OK.

392
00:18:58,673 --> 00:18:59,941
Remember that interference

393
00:18:59,966 --> 00:19:00,804
that happened during our download?

394
00:19:00,852 --> 00:19:02,219
Don't tell me you lost the data.

395
00:19:02,244 --> 00:19:03,810
Deputy director bell's gonna be pissed.

396
00:19:03,835 --> 00:19:05,569
No. The opposite.

397
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:08,386
I think someone duplicated
the file simultaneously

398
00:19:08,411 --> 00:19:09,489
as we downloaded it.

399
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:10,786
That's impossible.

400
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:13,750
The only ones who knew about
this op were me, you, and Lyla.

401
00:19:13,828 --> 00:19:16,094
Yeah. And judging from
your face, it wasn't you.

402
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:20,267
It definitely wasn't me.
So that only leaves...?

403
00:19:22,249 --> 00:19:24,216
Why would Lyla make a
copy of that data?

404
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:27,159
Maybe it's not as shady as it seems.

405
00:19:27,736 --> 00:19:29,484
Why would she hide this from me?

406
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:31,319
Sometimes secrets are
good in a marriage.

407
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:32,783
You know, it keeps the spice alive.

408
00:19:32,808 --> 00:19:34,186
Actually, don't quote me on that.

409
00:19:34,211 --> 00:19:36,536
I'm actually divorced.
What are you gonna do?

410
00:19:36,561 --> 00:19:39,316
Find out why my wife is lying to me.

411
00:19:46,242 --> 00:19:48,413
Where do you think they
keep the dead rats?

412
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:50,169
So inhumane.

413
00:19:52,763 --> 00:19:54,530
I got eyes on Diaz,

414
00:19:54,555 --> 00:19:56,414
and he brought two psychos with him.

415
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:59,493
Any chance they left
the third one at home?

416
00:19:59,518 --> 00:20:02,825
It's doubtful. The Silencer
wouldn't want to miss this.

417
00:20:06,876 --> 00:20:08,609
They've reached the lab.

418
00:20:13,135 --> 00:20:14,916
Hold up. The zombies
just walked right in,

419
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:16,427
no key card or nothing.

420
00:20:16,452 --> 00:20:17,877
That doesn't make any sense.

421
00:20:17,902 --> 00:20:19,481
It doesn't matter. Just lock the doors.

422
00:20:19,506 --> 00:20:20,880
_

423
00:20:20,905 --> 00:20:23,215
Frak. Frak. Frak. Frak.

424
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,658
Make better sounds, Felicity.

425
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:26,555
Whatever's opening that door is
jamming my access frequencies.

426
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,427
It's some sort of Sonic disruption.

427
00:20:28,452 --> 00:20:29,441
The coms are still working.

428
00:20:29,466 --> 00:20:30,651
Well, how about I save the details

429
00:20:30,676 --> 00:20:31,932
of acoustic-injection cyberattacks

430
00:20:31,957 --> 00:20:33,617
for post-mission happy hour?

431
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,641
The silencer. She must've
brought a new toy.

432
00:20:38,141 --> 00:20:39,652
Can you turn it off?

433
00:20:39,677 --> 00:20:41,346
I can't hack it, but I can track it.

434
00:20:42,022 --> 00:20:43,379
She's in the northeast corridor,

435
00:20:43,404 --> 00:20:45,411
headed towards the mechanical room.

436
00:20:45,436 --> 00:20:47,354
I'm on it. But once I catch up to her,

437
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:50,032
it'll be radio silence, literally.

438
00:20:55,697 --> 00:20:58,264
What my darts could do
with all this stuff!

439
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:01,125
Yeah, if it doesn't kill you first.

440
00:21:05,028 --> 00:21:07,067
I found it.

441
00:21:12,966 --> 00:21:15,471
Diaz is packing up. We got to hurry.

442
00:21:15,496 --> 00:21:17,432
- Time for plan "B".
- No, no, no.

443
00:21:17,457 --> 00:21:19,772
That's a big old negative. Manual
overrides are in the basement.

444
00:21:19,797 --> 00:21:21,468
And, again, no locks, no entry.

445
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:23,217
- I can't let Diaz escape.
- What are you, crazy?

446
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:24,675
You can't beat them.

447
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:26,252
I don't have to.

448
00:21:26,277 --> 00:21:27,836
I just got to keep them
in that room long enough

449
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:29,807
for you to lock those doors.

450
00:21:32,223 --> 00:21:34,557
I'm in the mechanical room.

451
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,832
Uh, guys, just FYI: A lot
of things in that lab

452
00:21:59,857 --> 00:22:01,136
don't react nicely to gunfire.

453
00:22:01,161 --> 00:22:03,584
So one stray bullet, and
the whole place goes boom.

454
00:22:08,298 --> 00:22:09,630
FBI.

455
00:22:09,655 --> 00:22:11,307
Stop right there.

456
00:22:11,332 --> 00:22:13,026
Agent Watson,

457
00:22:13,414 --> 00:22:16,190
I see you're reunited
with some old friends.

458
00:22:16,215 --> 00:22:18,107
Step away from the cooler, Diaz,

459
00:22:18,132 --> 00:22:19,767
and put your hands in the air...

460
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:20,768
Slowly.

461
00:22:20,793 --> 00:22:22,524
Can you please handle this?

462
00:22:25,283 --> 00:22:26,949
Errr.

463
00:22:34,326 --> 00:22:35,781
Hyah!

464
00:22:56,389 --> 00:22:59,808
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah...

465
00:23:22,249 --> 00:23:24,160
Play time's over.

466
00:23:34,886 --> 00:23:36,671
Let's go!

467
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:42,123
The Silencer's still here
in the mechanical room.

468
00:23:42,148 --> 00:23:44,814
I'll take Diaz. You help Dinah.

469
00:24:00,604 --> 00:24:02,606
This is gonna be fun.

470
00:24:09,885 --> 00:24:11,244
D.

471
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:13,747
I'm fine. Go! Go get her. Go!

472
00:24:16,905 --> 00:24:18,290
Diaz got away.

473
00:24:22,285 --> 00:24:25,073
- Rene, can you hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you.

474
00:24:25,098 --> 00:24:26,847
The Silencer's the only
lead we have on Diaz.

475
00:24:26,872 --> 00:24:29,262
We can't let her escape.

476
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,221
The Silencer got away.

477
00:24:44,388 --> 00:24:46,321
On a scale of one to unemployment,

478
00:24:46,346 --> 00:24:47,666
how much trouble is she in?

479
00:24:47,691 --> 00:24:50,138
Well, she wasn't supposed to
be here in the first place;

480
00:24:50,163 --> 00:24:51,865
Diaz escaped with the compound;

481
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,026
and we have no idea where or
how he's planning on using it.

482
00:24:55,673 --> 00:24:57,206
So a lot?

483
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,583
Hey, Rene sure got out
of here in a hurry.

484
00:25:03,608 --> 00:25:04,832
Well, can you blame him?

485
00:25:04,857 --> 00:25:05,686
I mean, the FBI and him

486
00:25:05,711 --> 00:25:09,182
don't exactly have a
love-love relationship.

487
00:25:10,608 --> 00:25:12,041
How bad is it?

488
00:25:12,066 --> 00:25:13,598
What do you think?

489
00:25:13,623 --> 00:25:15,728
I mean, the Silencer was right there.

490
00:25:15,753 --> 00:25:16,658
I don't understand how he

491
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:18,028
managed to let her slip past us.

492
00:25:18,053 --> 00:25:20,108
Rene must have missed her by seconds.

493
00:25:20,564 --> 00:25:24,589
I have to go. My boss is
waiting for me at the office.

494
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,979
Agent Watson...

495
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:31,870
Thank you for trying.

496
00:25:43,301 --> 00:25:44,958
Brick's gonna be extra
pissed to see you.

497
00:25:44,983 --> 00:25:46,263
He thinks you're dead.

498
00:25:46,288 --> 00:25:48,510
Well, he's in for a surprise.

499
00:25:48,535 --> 00:25:49,793
Come on.

500
00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:52,557
What are we walking into?

501
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,515
Brick will probably
have prisoners posted

502
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,219
outside the mess hall.

503
00:25:57,244 --> 00:25:58,840
You talk us past them.

504
00:25:58,865 --> 00:26:01,095
And if you say one wrong word...

505
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,758
Yeah, slash goes the artery.
Yeah, I get it.

506
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:06,698
You know, it's nice to know
that you'd shiv yourself

507
00:26:06,723 --> 00:26:09,110
to save some hardass guard

508
00:26:09,507 --> 00:26:11,832
but you have no problem shivving me.

509
00:26:11,857 --> 00:26:14,399
Well, you ambushed me.

510
00:26:15,234 --> 00:26:17,457
You think I had a choice in that?

511
00:26:17,482 --> 00:26:18,500
Brick calls the shots.

512
00:26:18,525 --> 00:26:20,824
If I don't try to kill you,

513
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:22,501
then Brick kills me.

514
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:25,200
Every man here is out for number one,

515
00:26:25,225 --> 00:26:26,967
including you.

516
00:26:26,992 --> 00:26:29,569
Everything I do is for my family.

517
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,033
You're just out for yourself.

518
00:26:36,953 --> 00:26:39,958
You think you know me so well.

519
00:26:40,301 --> 00:26:42,134
You know nothing about me.

520
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,266
I know you made a deal with China White

521
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:45,829
to have me killed,

522
00:26:46,082 --> 00:26:48,109
and I know you helped steal a weapon

523
00:26:48,134 --> 00:26:50,738
that blew up half the glades.

524
00:26:50,763 --> 00:26:53,602
What about Markovia, 2014?

525
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:56,448
A known terrorist named Gholem Qadir.

526
00:26:56,473 --> 00:26:58,039
Or did you forget I was
part of the mission

527
00:26:58,064 --> 00:26:59,530
that helped bring him down?

528
00:26:59,555 --> 00:27:02,131
A.R.G.U.S. put an explosive
in the back of your neck.

529
00:27:02,811 --> 00:27:04,269
You didn't have a choice.

530
00:27:04,294 --> 00:27:05,335
Oh, but I did have a choice

531
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,019
to save your friend's life.

532
00:27:07,618 --> 00:27:10,199
Yeah. Lyla and I were alone

533
00:27:10,224 --> 00:27:12,194
when Qadir tried to slit her throat,

534
00:27:12,219 --> 00:27:13,602
and I drove my blade

535
00:27:13,627 --> 00:27:15,204
right through his back.

536
00:27:15,689 --> 00:27:18,542
John never told me it was
you who saved her life.

537
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:20,224
Yeah, why would he?

538
00:27:20,363 --> 00:27:23,223
You and your team only
saw me as one thing...

539
00:27:23,418 --> 00:27:24,678
The enemy.

540
00:27:25,635 --> 00:27:28,627
But now look at us, both in prison.

541
00:27:29,812 --> 00:27:31,413
So I guess we're not that different

542
00:27:31,438 --> 00:27:33,091
after all.

543
00:27:54,889 --> 00:27:56,398
You followed me.

544
00:27:56,423 --> 00:27:58,001
Well, I wouldn't have had
to if you had told me

545
00:27:58,026 --> 00:28:00,719
the real reason why
we're in Zurich, Lyla.

546
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:03,373
- It's not what it looks like.
- Really? That's good.

547
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:04,422
That's good, because it looks like you

548
00:28:04,447 --> 00:28:06,718
just handed over sensitive
A.R.G.U.S. Intel

549
00:28:06,743 --> 00:28:07,821
to a criminal.

550
00:28:07,846 --> 00:28:09,141
I thought you'd have a little
more faith in me than that.

551
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:10,957
I did until this very moment.

552
00:28:11,575 --> 00:28:15,476
Lyla, just tell me what's going on...

553
00:28:17,248 --> 00:28:18,542
The truth.

554
00:28:20,956 --> 00:28:22,889
I caught wind of something...

555
00:28:23,348 --> 00:28:25,481
Money changing hands that's...

556
00:28:26,044 --> 00:28:28,227
That's bigger than anything
we've been up against.

557
00:28:28,443 --> 00:28:31,154
I ran it up the chain but kept
getting stymied by the brass.

558
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:32,229
Not enough evidence.

559
00:28:32,254 --> 00:28:33,824
What, so you're going
behind A.R.G.U.S.'s back?

560
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:35,197
I didn't expect judgment from someone

561
00:28:35,222 --> 00:28:37,637
who's spent so much time
delivering justice in the shadows.

562
00:28:37,662 --> 00:28:38,935
Oh, Lyla, that's not what I'm saying.

563
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,694
Listen to me, I just...
I just can't believe

564
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:44,086
you would hide this from me.

565
00:28:44,111 --> 00:28:45,008
After everything we've been through,

566
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:46,377
I thought the one thing
we agreed on is that

567
00:28:46,402 --> 00:28:48,176
there will be no more
secrets between us.

568
00:28:49,865 --> 00:28:51,879
I was trying to protect you.

569
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:53,615
I wasn't keeping secrets.

570
00:28:54,294 --> 00:28:56,681
You didn't want to take
up Oliver's mantle,

571
00:28:56,908 --> 00:28:58,596
and I respect that,

572
00:28:58,621 --> 00:29:00,625
but being the director of A.R.G.U.S.
has shown me

573
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:03,062
that there is far more evil in the
world than people willing to fight it.

574
00:29:03,087 --> 00:29:07,077
And I can't stand around
anymore and just watch.

575
00:29:07,102 --> 00:29:09,868
Johnny, sometimes you
have to cross the line

576
00:29:09,893 --> 00:29:11,433
for the greater good.

577
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,532
I would expect you to understand that.

578
00:29:25,896 --> 00:29:27,829
Two prisoners guarding
the mess hall door,

579
00:29:27,854 --> 00:29:29,324
just like Turner said.

580
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,766
You're up.

581
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:36,822
Get me in there or else.

582
00:29:48,065 --> 00:29:49,861
Step aside, fellas.

583
00:29:49,886 --> 00:29:51,730
Green Arrow's joining our little game.

584
00:29:51,755 --> 00:29:52,854
You kidding?

585
00:29:53,204 --> 00:29:54,944
We can't let Queen in here.

586
00:29:54,969 --> 00:29:58,040
You'd better. He's VIP.

587
00:29:58,504 --> 00:30:01,450
The high rollers will be
very happy to see him.

588
00:30:05,314 --> 00:30:07,375
You're coming in there with me.

589
00:30:07,855 --> 00:30:11,228
Good. I'd hate to miss all the fun.

590
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:26,426
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

591
00:30:31,878 --> 00:30:34,459
Gentlemen, gentlemen,

592
00:30:34,484 --> 00:30:38,427
it seems we have an unexpected
treat for you this evening...

593
00:30:38,452 --> 00:30:40,978
An epic, once-in-a-lifetime match-up:

594
00:30:41,003 --> 00:30:45,724
Our champion, Sampson,
versus the Green Arrow!

595
00:30:52,963 --> 00:30:55,285
I kind of wish we stayed outside.

596
00:30:57,471 --> 00:31:01,123
No. I don't have time for this.

597
00:31:03,676 --> 00:31:05,576
Where you going, Arrow?

598
00:31:11,487 --> 00:31:13,770
Oh, you're way tougher than this guy.

599
00:31:13,795 --> 00:31:16,850
What do you say? Time for a rematch?

600
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,709
Last time didn't end so well for you.

601
00:31:18,734 --> 00:31:21,182
This time, I'm gonna kill you.

602
00:31:21,207 --> 00:31:24,308
Gentlemen, place your bets.

603
00:31:24,772 --> 00:31:26,680
This is gonna be a hell of a pay day.

604
00:31:26,705 --> 00:31:28,053
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

605
00:31:32,063 --> 00:31:34,697
Ow! Uh!

606
00:31:35,097 --> 00:31:37,249
That's it, Sampson. Hit him.

607
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,786
You got this, Oliver!

608
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,062
Yes!

609
00:32:18,718 --> 00:32:19,884
Yield!

610
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:20,934
Never.

611
00:32:24,745 --> 00:32:26,811
That was awesome.

612
00:32:26,836 --> 00:32:28,577
What a performance.

613
00:32:28,602 --> 00:32:31,349
I'll let you in on a secret, Queen.

614
00:32:31,572 --> 00:32:35,983
My money was on you.
You're a hard man to kill.

615
00:32:43,697 --> 00:32:45,097
Stand down!

616
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:54,802
No more games.

617
00:32:55,511 --> 00:32:58,085
Tell me where to find the Demon.

618
00:32:59,276 --> 00:33:00,876
Brick...

619
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,215
Don't make me ask you again.

620
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,433
I've had you running around,
playing fetch for me

621
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:10,283
like my grandmother's springer spaniel.

622
00:33:10,826 --> 00:33:12,725
And you know the best part?

623
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,640
You'll never get to the Demon,

624
00:33:15,665 --> 00:33:18,745
'cause you're on the wrong level.

625
00:33:18,922 --> 00:33:20,846
The Demon is on Level 2,

626
00:33:20,871 --> 00:33:22,857
the place for the worst of the worst.

627
00:33:22,882 --> 00:33:25,542
And that just isn't you now.

628
00:33:26,551 --> 00:33:29,128
Isn't that right, Arrow?

629
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:28,541
Oliver, you got a plan, right?

630
00:34:28,676 --> 00:34:30,610
Stop worrying about me.

631
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:34,747
Just try to keep your head down.

632
00:34:34,962 --> 00:34:37,793
Maybe Level 2 isn't as
bad as everyone says.

633
00:34:37,818 --> 00:34:39,191
As long as it gives me what I want,

634
00:34:39,216 --> 00:34:40,753
I don't care.

635
00:34:43,549 --> 00:34:46,820
You were never gonna be
able to stay a hero...

636
00:34:48,721 --> 00:34:50,818
Not in this place.

637
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,766
Thanks for coming.

638
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:03,256
I'm guessing you didn't
call me in to tell me

639
00:35:03,281 --> 00:35:04,504
you're getting promoted.

640
00:35:04,529 --> 00:35:06,487
Ha ha. I've been reassigned.

641
00:35:06,512 --> 00:35:08,415
Desk jockey job back in D.C.

642
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,218
And I'm guessing that new
gig takes you far away

643
00:35:10,243 --> 00:35:12,198
from the Diaz investigation.

644
00:35:12,223 --> 00:35:13,899
That's the idea.

645
00:35:14,951 --> 00:35:16,253
I hope you're not expecting
me to apologize.

646
00:35:16,278 --> 00:35:18,930
I'm not. I knew I was putting
my career on the line

647
00:35:18,955 --> 00:35:21,172
when I agreed to work
with you and your team.

648
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,423
I believe that good law enforcement

649
00:35:24,448 --> 00:35:25,728
does make up for the bad,

650
00:35:25,753 --> 00:35:27,110
and I always will.

651
00:35:27,135 --> 00:35:29,478
But going off the books to catch Diaz?

652
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:31,197
That was the right thing to do.

653
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:40,047
You don't deserve to live
without your family.

654
00:35:40,332 --> 00:35:42,395
You're a good person, Felicity.

655
00:35:42,814 --> 00:35:44,332
Hmm.

656
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,942
I never thought I'd
hear myself say this,

657
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:51,175
but I'm very sorry to see
you go, agent Watson.

658
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:54,221
I'm sorry Diaz and his crew got away.

659
00:35:54,246 --> 00:35:55,660
I mean, things would've
turned out different

660
00:35:55,685 --> 00:35:57,430
if we'd gotten at least something
on that son of a bitch.

661
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:59,321
I know. I know. I'm with you.

662
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:02,836
Square one sucks.

663
00:36:08,663 --> 00:36:10,223
You ready?

664
00:36:10,248 --> 00:36:13,500
To get home to J.J. and out
of this hotel room? Yes.

665
00:36:13,525 --> 00:36:14,761
Can we talk first?

666
00:36:14,786 --> 00:36:16,953
- Talk or lecture?
- Lyla, I'm sorry.

667
00:36:18,155 --> 00:36:19,776
I was wrong.

668
00:36:23,862 --> 00:36:25,861
I should've given you the chance

669
00:36:25,886 --> 00:36:27,937
to explain yourself before accusing you

670
00:36:27,962 --> 00:36:29,642
of being something that you are not.

671
00:36:30,173 --> 00:36:32,149
I know things have been hard for you

672
00:36:32,174 --> 00:36:35,646
with Oliver gone, but
you have to trust me.

673
00:36:35,671 --> 00:36:37,144
I do trust you,

674
00:36:37,422 --> 00:36:39,218
but, Lyla, all of this,

675
00:36:40,181 --> 00:36:42,414
it's so dangerous.

676
00:36:42,896 --> 00:36:44,274
I think of J.J.

677
00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:48,042
So do I, which is why I
can't turn my back on this.

678
00:36:50,907 --> 00:36:52,306
You were right.

679
00:36:54,393 --> 00:36:56,728
Sometimes you do have
to cross the line.

680
00:36:57,289 --> 00:37:00,265
Just promise me, next time

681
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:02,397
something like this happens...

682
00:37:05,003 --> 00:37:06,887
Let me in.

683
00:37:09,636 --> 00:37:11,169
I promise.

684
00:37:20,212 --> 00:37:22,012
This was a bad idea.

685
00:37:22,037 --> 00:37:23,586
We didn't have a choice.

686
00:37:23,611 --> 00:37:26,240
Listen, I'm not a super
fan of Agent Watson,

687
00:37:26,265 --> 00:37:27,431
but we got her in trouble.

688
00:37:27,456 --> 00:37:28,914
We didn't make her do anything.

689
00:37:28,939 --> 00:37:30,676
We've been sitting and waiting

690
00:37:30,701 --> 00:37:32,041
for the law to catch Diaz for months.

691
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:33,445
I am tired of waiting.

692
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,995
I get that, but...

693
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,898
Isn't this kind of what we've
been doing the whole time,

694
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:38,269
stepping in when the system fails?

695
00:37:38,294 --> 00:37:40,539
Isn't that sort of a vigilante M.O.?

696
00:37:40,564 --> 00:37:42,289
Sometimes you have to
cross the line for that.

697
00:37:42,314 --> 00:37:44,906
Listen, nobody believes
in that more than me.

698
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:47,781
I'm just not sure that's what this is.

699
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,607
They got Honor.

700
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,774
She's a big girl. She can
take care of herself.

701
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,652
Ever since I was blown off that roof...

702
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:21,550
All I've felt is pain...

703
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,574
The pain of betrayal,

704
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:32,448
the pain of having every
bone in my body shattered...

705
00:38:34,006 --> 00:38:36,214
When I hit the water.

706
00:38:38,511 --> 00:38:40,576
But I didn't panic.

707
00:38:42,233 --> 00:38:44,324
I was patient.

708
00:38:49,508 --> 00:38:51,508
And that patience

709
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:56,989
helped me to find a way
to transform that pain...

710
00:38:58,264 --> 00:39:00,661
Into something else.

711
00:39:15,509 --> 00:39:18,574
Aha! huh!

712
00:39:29,104 --> 00:39:31,242
Strength.

713
00:39:45,323 --> 00:39:47,164
Let's go, 4587.

714
00:39:47,189 --> 00:39:48,957
You're going downstairs.

715
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:15,827
Have fun down there.

716
00:40:15,852 --> 00:40:19,156
I hear the only way out of
Level 2 is through the morgue.
