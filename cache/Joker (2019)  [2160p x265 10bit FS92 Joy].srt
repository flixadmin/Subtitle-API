here's what's happening.</i>

7
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:22,958
<i>It's day 18
of the garbage strike,</i>

8
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:25,794
<i>with 10,000 tons of
garbage piling up every day.</i>

9
00:00:25,927 --> 00:00:28,029
<i>Even the nicest sections
of the city</i>

10
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:29,531
<i>are looking like slums.</i>

11
00:00:29,664 --> 00:00:31,266
<i>Health Commissioner
Edward O'Rourke is</i>

12

<i>or comes down
with typhoid fever.</i>

16
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,942
<i>It's already
a serious situation.</i>

17
00:00:41,076 --> 00:00:42,410
<i>It's something that affects</i>

18
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:43,912
<i>almost everyone in the city,</i>

19
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:45,780
<i>no matter who they are

20
00:00:45,914 --> 00:00:47,849
<i>You can't go down no one avenue</i>

21

22
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:51,662
<i>It's starting to
affect my business</i>

23
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:53,087
<i>when customers
can't get in here</i>

24
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:54,823
<i>because of
the garbage situation.</i>

25
00:00:54,956 --> 00:00:56,624
<i>I'm not out that
long to smell it,</i>

26
00:00:56,758 --> 00:00:58,438
<i>but I think to look
at it, it's terrible.</i>

27
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:00,028
<i>It don't affect me except</i>

28
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:01,862
<i>for the very bad smell here.</i>

29
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:02,997
<i>It's horrific.</i>

30
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:04,532
<i>It's a mess.</i>

31
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,266
<i>I've been in this country

anything like it.</i>

33
00:01:07,702 --> 00:01:09,003
<i>What is this world coming to?</i>

34
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:10,839
<i>Put 'em in a room,</i>

35
00:01:10,973 --> 00:01:12,650

Yo, what's up
with your shoes, bro?

46
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:05,727
Nice outfit, pal.

47
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:07,338
If you're gonna be a
clown, at least you could be

48
00:02:07,362 --> 00:02:08,696
a good one.
You know that, right?

49
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,231
- Hey! Hey!
- -Grab it!

50
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:11,365
Go, go, go!

51
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:13,000
Hey!

52
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:14,569
He's coming!

53
00:02:14,703 --> 00:02:16,671
Come on, clown, let's
go! We've got the sign.

54
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:18,539
- Look at him running.
- -Let's go!

55
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,041
Stop them!

56
00:02:20,175 --> 00:02:22,055
Go, go, go, go!
Watch the car, watch the car!

57
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,813
Where's your sign, clown?

58
00:02:25,947 --> 00:02:27,214
Hey!

59
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,153
Go, clown!
Come on!

60
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:34,355
Stop them!

61
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,791
Go! Come on!

62
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:41,328
Stop them!

63
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:43,363
Come on, run!

64
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:46,767
Hey!

65
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,336
You fucking...

66
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,043
- Oh, shit!
- Good hit.

67
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:57,779
Come on!
Beat his ass up.

68
00:02:57,912 --> 00:02:59,914
Come on! This guy's
weak. He can't do nothing.

69
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,983
Harder! Harder!

70
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:03,351
Beat him up.
Take his stuff.

71
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:06,220
Let's go, let's go!
Come on. Let's go!

72
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,776
Ha!

73
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:52,326
Is it just me,

74
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,061
or is it getting
crazier out there?

75
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:01,902
- It is certainly tense.
- Hmm.

76
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:03,704
People are upset.

77
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:06,941
They're struggling.
Looking for work.

78
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:08,308
These are tough times.

79
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:12,913
How about you?

80
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:16,683
Have you been keeping
up with your journal?

81
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,120
Yes, ma'am.

82
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,657
Great.

83
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,625
Did you bring it with you?

84
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:31,566
Arthur.

85
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,579
Last time, I asked you
to bring your journal

86
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:36,003
with you for these appointments.

87
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:37,604
Can I see it?

88
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,486
I've been using it as a journal,

89
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,690
but also as a joke diary.

90
00:05:56,824 --> 00:06:00,527
Funny thoughts or observations.

91
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:02,830
I think I told you

92
00:06:02,964 --> 00:06:05,966
I'm pursuing a career
in stand-up comedy.

93
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:11,004
No, you didn't.

94
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,574
I think I did.

95
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:26,953
"I just hope my death makes
more sense than my life."

96
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,239
How does it feel to
have to come here?

97
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:48,575
Does it help to have
someone to talk to?

98
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:53,681
I think I felt better

99
00:06:53,815 --> 00:06:55,882
when I was locked
up in the hospital.

100
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,119
And have you thought more about

101
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:02,256
why you were locked up?

102
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,529
Who knows?

103
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,005
I was wondering if
you could ask the doctor

104
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:20,473
to increase my medication.

105
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:29,684
Arthur, you're on
seven different medications.

106
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:32,686
Surely, they must
be doing something.

107
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:38,258
I just don't want to
feel so bad anymore.

108
00:08:14,128 --> 00:08:16,663
Would you please
stop bothering my kid?

109
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,643
I wasn't bothering him.
I was...

110
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,035
Just stop.

111
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:32,246
What?
You think that's funny?

112
00:08:40,755 --> 00:08:42,255
I'm sorry.
I have a...

113
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,240
I'm sorry.

114
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:39,973
Happy, did you check the mail

115
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:41,575
before you came up?

116
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,376
Yeah, Mom.

117
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:45,945
Nothing.

118
00:10:48,683 --> 00:10:50,418
<i>And finally, tonight,</i>

119
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:52,986
<i>just when you thought
it couldn't get any worse...</i>

120
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,488
<i>...authorities are saying</i>

121
00:10:54,622 --> 00:10:56,590
<i>the city is under siege
by scores of rats.</i>

122
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,025
<i>And not just any rats,</i>

123
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,127
<i>but super rats,
who are hard to kill.</i>

124
00:11:00,261 --> 00:11:02,395
He must not be
getting my letters.

125
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:03,564
Yeah.

126
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:05,732
It's Thomas Wayne, Mom.

127
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,201
He's a busy man.

128
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:11,338
Please. I worked for
that family for years.

129
00:11:11,472 --> 00:11:13,873
The least he could do
is write back.

130
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:18,445
Here. Don't get
all worked up. Eat.

131
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:19,813
You need to eat.

132
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:23,483
You need to eat. Look
how skinny you are.

133
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,997
<i>Both victims were
taken to Gotham General.</i>

134
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:28,389
<i>Sounds like</i>

135
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,157
<i>the city needs to
find the Pied Piper.</i>

136
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,051
He'll make a great
mayor. Everybody says so.

137
00:11:32,093 --> 00:11:35,963
Oh, yeah. Everybody
who? Who do you talk to?

138
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:38,399
Well, everybody on the news.

139
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,867
He's the only one
who could save the city.

140
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,468
He owes it to us.

141
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:46,807
- Come sit.
- It's starting.

142
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,343
Yay, Murray.

143

Thank you.

Thank you.

154

We got a great-looking
audience tonight.

155
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,224
Yeah!

Wow. Thank you.
Thank you.

Thank you.

158
00:12:41,295 --> 00:12:43,531
So, everybody's heard
about the super rats that

159
00:12:43,664 --> 00:12:46,133
- are in Gotham now, right?
- -Yeah.

160
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:49,770
Well, today, the mayor
said he has a solution.

161
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:51,538
You ready for this?

162
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:52,906
Super cats.

163
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:58,855
But in all seriousness,
I mean, these rats are...

164
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,447
I love you, Murray!

165
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:03,550
I love you, too.

166
00:13:05,353 --> 00:13:07,220
Hey, Bobby, would
you put the lights on?

167
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:08,589
Who is that?

168
00:13:08,723 --> 00:13:10,624
Was that you? You
wanna stand up, please?

169
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,692
Stand up for me.

170
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,027
Go ahead.

171
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:21,034
What's your name?

172
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,170
Hi, Murray. Arthur.

173
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,905
- Arthur?
- My name's Arthur.

174
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,950
Oh, okay. Well, there's
something special about you,

175
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,008
Arthur, I could tell.

176
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,243
Where are you from?

177
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:31,045
I live right here in the city

178
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:33,046
with my mother.

179
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:35,382
Okay, hold on.
Hold on.

180
00:13:35,516 --> 00:13:37,318
There's nothing funny
about that.

181
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:39,496
I lived with my mother before
I made it. Just me and her.

182
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,256
I'm that kid whose father
went out for a pack of cigarettes,

183
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:43,523
and he never came back.

184
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:44,892
Aww.

185
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,694
I know what that's like, Murray.

186
00:13:46,828 --> 00:13:49,329
I've been the man of the house
for as long as I can remember.

187
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:51,464
I take good care of my mother.

188
00:13:55,403 --> 00:13:58,538
All that sacrifice, she
must love you very much.

189
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,308
She does.

190
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:04,245
She always tells me to
smile and put on a happy face.

191
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:07,013
She says I was put here
to spread joy and laughter.

192
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:08,915
Aww.

193
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,218
Wow.

194
00:14:14,622 --> 00:14:17,424
I like that. I like that
a lot. Come on down.

195
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:20,427
Come on. For that,
you gotta come down.

196
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:22,029
Come on! Come on.

197
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,270
Come on.

198
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:48,655
Okay, we got a big
show tonight. Stay tuned.

199
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:51,091
We'll be right back.

200
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:52,745
That was great,
Arthur. Thank you.

201
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:54,694
I mean, I loved hearing
what you had to say.

202
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:55,996
It made my day.

203
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:57,498
Thanks, Murray.

204
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:59,299
You see all this,
the lights, the show,

205
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:00,868
the audience, all that stuff?

206
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,178
I'd give it all up
in a heartbeat

207
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:03,536
to have a kid like you.

208
00:15:45,813 --> 00:15:47,914
- What's up, ladies?
- Hey, Randall. What's up?

209
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:49,783
Another day in chuckle town.

210
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,117
Yup.

211
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:55,621
You okay?

212
00:15:57,391 --> 00:16:00,193
I heard about
the beatdown you took.

213
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,963
Fucking savages.

214
00:16:03,097 --> 00:16:05,765
It was just a bunch of kids.
I should have left it alone.

215
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:07,401
No.

216
00:16:07,535 --> 00:16:09,445
They'll take everything
from you if you do that.

217
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,238
All the crazy shit out there.

218
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:13,339
They're animals.

219
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:19,178
You know what?

220
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:25,384
Here.

221
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,555
What is it?

222
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:29,755
Take it.

223
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,757
It's for you.

224
00:16:36,464 --> 00:16:38,565
You gotta protect
yourself out there.

225
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,500
Otherwise, you're
gonna get fucked.

226
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,336
Randall,

227
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:47,406
I'm not supposed to have a gun.

228
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,911
Don't sweat it, Art.

229
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,379
No one has to know.

230
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:54,848
And you can pay me
back some other time.

231
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:56,349
You know you're my boy.

232
00:16:58,318 --> 00:16:59,686
Arthur,

233
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,889
Hoyt wants to
see you in his office.

234
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,824
Hey, Gary. You know
what I've always wondered?

235
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,126
No idea.

236
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,994
Do you people call it
miniature golf

237
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,330
or is it just golf to you?

238
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,502
Punch him in the dick, Gary.

239
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:34,988
Hello, Hoyt.

240
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:37,524
Gary said you wanted to see me.

241
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:40,727
How's the comedy career?
Are you a famous stand-up yet?

242
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,129
Not quite.

243
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,131
Just been working
on my material.

244
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:46,199
No, don't sit.
This'll be quick.

245
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,934
Look, I like you, Arthur.

246
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,336
You know, a lot of the guys,

247
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,310
they think you're a freak,
but I like you.

248
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,241
I don't even know
why I like you.

249
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:56,477
But I got another complaint.

250
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,446
It's starting to piss
me off. Kenny's Music.

251
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,448
The guy said you disappeared.

252
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,282
Never even returned his sign.

253
00:18:03,984 --> 00:18:05,985
Because I got jumped.

254
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,887
Didn't you hear?

255
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:09,623
For a sign?

256
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:12,092
That's bullshit. It
doesn't even make sense.

257
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:13,994
Just get him his sign back.

258
00:18:14,128 --> 00:18:16,830
He's going out of business,
for God's sake, Arthur.

259
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,599
Why would I keep his sign?

260
00:18:18,732 --> 00:18:21,734
How the fuck do I know? Why
does anybody do anything?

261
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,771
If you don't return the sign,

262
00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:27,340
I gotta take it
out of your paycheck.

263
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,508
Are we clear?

264
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:33,547
Listen, I'm trying to help you.

265
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,849
Okay? And I'll tell you
something else.

266
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,384
The other guys,

267
00:18:37,518 --> 00:18:39,262
they don't feel comfortable
around you, Arthur,

268
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:41,254
because people
think you're weird.

269
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:44,190
Okay? And I can't
have that around me.

270
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,974
Wait, wait, wait.

271
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:36,309
Wait.

272
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,613
Thank you.

273
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:05,304
This building is
so awful, isn't it?

274
00:20:06,807 --> 00:20:09,376
This building is so
awful, right, Mommy?

275
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:12,045
Yes, we can hear you, GiGi.

276
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:15,014
It's so awful, Mommy.

277
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,416
Right, Mommy?

278
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:26,593
- Good night.
- This building's

279
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:27,927
- so awful, isn't it?
- Mmm-hmm.

280
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,667
Hey.

281
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,441
Come on.

282
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:02,829
- Look up.
- -Mmm.

283
00:21:02,963 --> 00:21:04,932
Maybe the mailman's
throwing them away.

284
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:08,768
Mom, why are these
letters so important to you?

285
00:21:08,902 --> 00:21:10,270
What do you think he's gonna do?

286
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:12,472
He's gonna help us.

287
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:16,743
But you worked for him,
what, 30 years ago?

288
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,778
Why would he help us?

289
00:21:18,912 --> 00:21:22,349
Because Thomas Wayne
is a good man.

290
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,952
If he knew how we were living,

291
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:29,823
if he saw this place, it
would make him sick.

292
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:32,892
I can't explain it to
you any better than that.

293
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:36,695
I don't want you worrying
about money, Mom.

294
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,299
Or me.

295
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:40,667
Everybody's telling me

296
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:44,171
that my stand-up's
ready for the big clubs.

297
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:47,440
But, Happy, what makes
you think you could do that?

298
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:50,143
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

299
00:21:50,277 --> 00:21:52,912
Don't you have to be
funny to be a comedian?

300
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:57,843
Hey, what's your name?

301
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:00,680
Arthur.

302
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:04,416
Hey, Arthur, you're
a really good dancer.

303
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:06,486
I know.

304
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,921
You know who's not?
Him.

305
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:16,362
Happy, what was that?
Are you okay?

306
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:17,964
Mom, what?

307
00:23:18,098 --> 00:23:19,766
That noise!
Did you hear that noise?

308
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,302
I'm watching an old war movie!

309
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:23,903
Turn it down!

310
00:23:24,037 --> 00:23:25,638
Um...

311
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:32,178
Sorry, Mom.

312
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:45,958
You good?

313
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,529
It's nice to see these
couples out at my show.

314
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,765
I have a wife.
We love to role-play.

315
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:01,668
- Ooh!
- Yes, yes, very sexy.

316
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:03,403
My favorite one right now is

317
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:06,439
professor and senior
who really needs

318
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:07,774
to pass my class to graduate.

319
00:25:09,075 --> 00:25:10,576
Yes.

320
00:25:11,745 --> 00:25:13,246
So, I'll tell you how I operate.

321
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:14,648
I'm a professor at

322
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:16,301
a prestigious
New England university...

323
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:21,420
and my wife is a senior in
my "Intro To Western Civ."

324
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:25,192
I know. I know.

325
00:25:25,325 --> 00:25:28,895
Why is she a senior in the
intro? I didn't buy it either.

326
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:30,830
So, she comes to me
during my office hours.

327
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:34,077
It's Monday and Wednesday,
three to five.

328
00:25:34,101 --> 00:25:36,002
She says, "Excuse
me, Professor Lewis."

329
00:25:36,136 --> 00:25:38,071
I can't use my real
last name at this college

330
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:39,772
'cause they don't hire Jews.

331
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:42,842
It's something I'll address

332
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:45,111
once I have tenure,
but for now...

333
00:25:45,245 --> 00:25:46,946
She says, "Excuse
me, Professor Lewis,

334
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,457
I think I might be
in danger of failing

335
00:25:48,481 --> 00:25:49,649
your 'Intro to Western Civ, '

336
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:50,917
and I just want you to know

337
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:53,253
I'm willing to do
anything to pass."

338
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:57,723
And I said, "Anything?"
And she said...

339
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:06,626
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

340
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:08,393
Were you following me today?

341
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:13,832
Yeah.

342
00:27:15,535 --> 00:27:17,938
I thought that was you.

343
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:20,806
I was hoping you'd
come in and rob the place.

344
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:24,077
I have a gun.

345
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,111
I could come by tomorrow.

346
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:31,049
You're so funny, Arthur.

347
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:34,287
Yeah.

348
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,023
You know, I do stand-up comedy.

349
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:40,159
You should maybe come
see a show sometime.

350
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,194
I could do that.

351
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,363
Yeah?

352
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,397
Yeah. You'll let me know when?

353
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:46,732
Yeah.

We should've just stayed.

397
00:29:45,052 --> 00:29:47,096
You're dreaming, man.
She wasn't interested at all.

398
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,688
Are you nuts?
Did you see how close we were dancing?

399
00:29:49,822 --> 00:29:51,057
She was in love.

449
00:37:11,664 --> 00:37:12,932
Did you really bring a gun

hospital, Artie?

456

It was his gun.

- I still owe you for that,

458

00:38:56,836 --> 00:38:59,004
<i>are taking the side
of the killer.</i>

485
00:38:59,138 --> 00:39:00,873
<i>Yes, and it's a shame.</i>

486
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:02,408
<i>It's one of the reasons why</i>

487
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:03,875
<i>I'm considering
a run for mayor.</i>

488
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:06,745
<i>Gotham's lost its way.</i>

489
00:39:06,879 --> 00:39:08,447
<i>What about
the eyewitness report</i>

490
00:39:08,581 --> 00:39:11,317
<i>of the suspect being a
man in a clown mask?</i>

491
00:39:11,451 --> 00:39:13,519
<i>Well, it makes
total sense to me.</i>

492
00:39:13,653 --> 00:39:15,973
<i>What kind of coward would
do something that cold-blooded?</i>

493
00:39:16,088 --> 00:39:18,490
<i>Someone who hides
behind a mask.</i>

494
00:39:18,624 --> 00:39:19,959
<i>Someone who is envious</i>

495
00:39:20,092 --> 00:39:24,030
<i>of those more fortunate
than themselves,</i>

496
00:39:24,163 --> 00:39:26,999
<i>yet they're too scared
to show their own face.</i>

497
00:39:27,133 --> 00:39:30,069
<i>And until those kind of
people change for the better,</i>

498
00:39:30,203 --> 00:39:33,873
<i>those of us who have
made something of our lives</i>

499
00:39:34,006 --> 00:39:36,475
<i>will always look
at those who haven't</i>

500
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:39,144
<i>as nothing but clowns.</i>

501
00:39:41,147 --> 00:39:43,091
<i>Thomas Wayne, thank you
for coming in this morning.</i>

502
00:39:43,115 --> 00:39:44,115
It's not funny.

503
00:40:05,705 --> 00:40:08,106
I heard this song on
the radio the other day,

504
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:14,979
and the guy was singing
that his name was Carnival.

505
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,182
Arthur...

506
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:18,650
Which is crazy,

507
00:40:20,753 --> 00:40:24,723
because that's
my clown name at work.

508
00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:27,625
And until a little while ago,

509
00:40:28,627 --> 00:40:31,229
it was like nobody ever saw me.

510
00:40:33,065 --> 00:40:35,768
Even I didn't know
if I really existed.

511
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:38,603
Arthur, I have
some bad news for you.

512
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:43,207
You don't listen, do you?

513
00:40:44,744 --> 00:40:49,682
I don't think you
ever really hear me.

514
00:40:49,815 --> 00:40:52,451
You just ask the same
questions every week.

515
00:40:52,585 --> 00:40:56,922
"How's your job? Are you
having any negative thoughts?"

516
00:40:57,056 --> 00:41:00,826
All I have are
negative thoughts,

517
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,829
but you don't listen anyway.

518
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:07,266
I said, for my whole life,

519
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:10,969
I didn't know
if I even really existed.

520
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,905
But I do.

521
00:41:15,074 --> 00:41:19,210
And people are
starting to notice.

522
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,615
They've cut our funding.

523
00:41:22,748 --> 00:41:24,682
We're closing down
our offices next week.

524
00:41:26,052 --> 00:41:27,920
The city has cut
funding across the board.

525
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:30,022
Social Services is part of that.

526
00:41:30,156 --> 00:41:32,590
This is the last time
we'll be meeting.

527
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:34,692
Okay.

528
00:41:38,464 --> 00:41:40,865
They don't give a shit
about people like you, Arthur.

529
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:44,336
And they really
don't give a shit

530
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:46,638
about people like me, either.

531
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:51,109
Fuck.

532
00:41:59,085 --> 00:42:01,886
How am I supposed to
get my medication now?

533
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,557
Who do I talk to?

534
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:10,762
I'm sorry, Arthur.

535
00:42:12,999 --> 00:42:17,236
<i>I think... I think most women
look at sex like buying a car.</i>

536
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:20,105
<i>You know, like, "Can I see
myself in this long-term?"</i>

537
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:22,240
<i>"Is it safe?"</i>

538
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:23,742
<i>"Is it reliable?"</i>

00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:26,012
<i>"Could it kill me?"</i>

540
00:42:26,145 --> 00:42:28,180
<i>Most guys, we look at
sex like parking a car.</i>

541
00:42:28,314 --> 00:42:30,816
<i>We're like,
"There's a spot."</i>

542
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:32,251
<i>"There's another spot.</i>

543
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:33,852
<i>That would work."</i>

544
00:42:33,986 --> 00:42:35,854
<i>"Oh, I have to pay?
Never mind."</i>

545
00:42:37,523 --> 00:42:40,392
<i>"Handicapped?
I hope no one sees this."</i>

546
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:45,330
<i>All right, that's my time.
Thank you very much, guys.</i>

547
00:42:50,336 --> 00:42:53,772
One more time
for Sam Morril, y'all.

548
00:42:53,906 --> 00:42:55,674
All right, now,
this next comic describes

549
00:42:55,808 --> 00:42:57,910
himself as
a lifelong Gotham resident

550
00:42:58,043 --> 00:43:00,478
who from a young age
was always told

551
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:02,281
that his purpose in life

552
00:43:02,415 --> 00:43:06,118
was to bring laughter and
joy into this cold, dark world.

553
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:07,853
Um... Okay.

554
00:43:07,987 --> 00:43:10,188
Please help me welcome
Arthur Fleck, y'all.

555
00:43:10,322 --> 00:43:11,323
Arthur Fleck.

556
00:43:35,414 --> 00:43:38,249
Hello, it's good to be here.

557
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:05,777
I hated school when I was a kid.

558
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:26,265
I hated school as a kid.

559
00:44:27,532 --> 00:44:29,067
My mother would say,

560
00:44:29,201 --> 00:44:30,803
"You should enjoy it.

561
00:44:30,936 --> 00:44:33,104
One day, you'll have
to work for a living."

562
00:44:34,273 --> 00:44:35,607
"No, I won't, Ma,

563
00:44:35,741 --> 00:44:37,442
I'm gonna
be a comedian."

564
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,019
Um...

565
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:52,291
Here's one.

566
00:44:52,424 --> 00:44:55,294
You know, I was just
thinking the other day,

567
00:44:55,427 --> 00:44:57,795
why are the rich people...

568
00:45:38,003 --> 00:45:39,470
You believe that shit?

569
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:42,340
Fuck 'em.

570
00:45:44,176 --> 00:45:47,078
I think the guy
that did it is a hero.

571
00:45:49,014 --> 00:45:51,116
Three less pricks
in Gotham City,

572
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:53,451
only a million more to go.

573
00:46:24,883 --> 00:46:26,518
<i>And, buddy, as always,</i>

574
00:46:26,651 --> 00:46:27,853
<i>thanks for the laughs.</i>

575
00:46:27,986 --> 00:46:29,288
<i>I'm sure we'll see you again.</i>

576
00:46:29,421 --> 00:46:30,756
<i>You know we'll be here, right?</i>

577
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:32,591
<i>I hope.</i>

578
00:46:32,725 --> 00:46:35,894
<i>Tomorrow night, we have
Diana Hudson, Greg Gordon,</i>

579
00:46:36,028 --> 00:46:39,464
<i>and animal expert, Hugh Little.</i>

580
00:46:39,598 --> 00:46:40,866
<i>Thanks for watching.</i>

581
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:43,201
<i>Good night,
and always remember,</i>

582
00:46:43,335 --> 00:46:44,803
<i>that's life.</i>

583
00:46:49,107 --> 00:46:50,441
That's life.

584
00:46:55,114 --> 00:46:58,350
Momma, time to
wake up and go to bed.

585
00:46:58,483 --> 00:46:59,984
Hmm? Oh...

586
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:03,554
Oh, Happy.

587
00:47:06,224 --> 00:47:07,959
Happy, I wrote a new letter.

588
00:47:08,093 --> 00:47:10,529
Come on, dance with me.

589
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:13,097
For Thomas Wayne.
It's important.

590
00:47:22,107 --> 00:47:23,675
You smell like cologne.

591
00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:26,578
It's 'cause I just
had a big date.

592
00:47:26,711 --> 00:47:28,546
Oh.

593
00:47:31,116 --> 00:47:33,117
Just don't forget to mail it.

594
00:47:58,577 --> 00:48:00,245

598
00:49:09,214 --> 00:49:10,415

599
00:49:10,549 --> 00:49:12,351
No. No.

600
00:49:12,484 --> 00:49:15,653
I'm not talking to you
until you stop being angry!

601
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:16,921
Okay.

602
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,322
Okay.

603
00:49:22,894 --> 00:49:24,996
I'm not angry, Mom.

604
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:27,598
I'm not angry.

605
00:49:27,732 --> 00:49:29,100
Please.

606
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:32,736
Mom, is this real?

607
00:49:36,274 --> 00:49:39,444
He's an extraordinary
man, Happy.

608
00:49:39,578 --> 00:49:42,246
He's a very powerful man.

609
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:46,218
We were in love.

610
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:48,219
He said it was best
that we not be together

611
00:49:48,353 --> 00:49:50,654
because of appearances.

612
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:56,527
And I could never
tell anyone because...

613
00:49:58,964 --> 00:50:00,531
Well, I signed some papers.

614
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,635
And besides, you can imagine

615
00:50:03,769 --> 00:50:07,471
what people would say
about Thomas and me.

616
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:11,542
What they'd say about you.

617
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:17,615
What would they say, Mom?

618
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:07,791
Hmm.

619
00:52:18,669 --> 00:52:19,770
Hmm.

620
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:51,902
Hi.

621
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:56,373
What's your name?

622
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:59,276
I'm Bruce.

623
00:53:00,144 --> 00:53:01,478
Bruce.

624
00:53:03,247 --> 00:53:04,648
I'm Arthur.

625
00:53:26,437 --> 00:53:27,938
That's better.

626
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,541
Bruce! Bruce!

627
00:53:31,743 --> 00:53:33,077
Get away from that man.

628
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:35,313
It's okay.
I'm a good guy.

629
00:53:35,447 --> 00:53:37,215
What are you doing?
Who are you?

630
00:53:37,348 --> 00:53:38,883
I'm here to see
Mr. Wayne.

631
00:53:39,017 --> 00:53:41,819
Well, you shouldn't be
speaking to his son.

632
00:53:42,954 --> 00:53:44,398
Why did you give him
these flowers?

633
00:53:44,422 --> 00:53:45,789
No, they're not real.

634
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,661
It's magic.

635
00:53:49,794 --> 00:53:51,329
I was just trying to
make him smile.

636
00:53:51,462 --> 00:53:54,199
Well, it's not funny, is it?

637
00:53:54,332 --> 00:53:55,500
Do I need to call the police?

638
00:53:55,633 --> 00:53:58,069
No. Please.

639
00:53:58,203 --> 00:54:01,573
My mother's name is
Penny. Penny Fleck.

640
00:54:01,706 --> 00:54:03,241
She used to work here years ago.

641
00:54:03,375 --> 00:54:05,415
Can you please tell
Mr. Wayne I need to see him?

642
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:07,878
You are her son.

643
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:09,413
Yeah.

644
00:54:09,547 --> 00:54:11,515
Did you know her?

645
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:17,822
I know about the two of them.

646
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:20,491
She told me everything.

647
00:54:21,993 --> 00:54:24,027
There's nothing to know.

648
00:54:25,129 --> 00:54:27,598
There is no "them."

649
00:54:27,732 --> 00:54:30,668
Your mother was delusional.

650
00:54:30,802 --> 00:54:32,069
She was a sick woman.

651
00:54:32,203 --> 00:54:34,438
Don't say that.

652
00:54:35,373 --> 00:54:36,874
Just go.

653
00:54:37,008 --> 00:54:38,109
Mmm?

654
00:54:38,243 --> 00:54:40,511
Before you make
a fool of yourself.

655
00:54:41,846 --> 00:54:44,515
Thomas Wayne is my father.

656
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,022
He left me.

657
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:54,925
Let go! Let go!

658
00:55:21,019 --> 00:55:22,888
Keep the respirations above 15.

659
00:55:23,021 --> 00:55:25,556
Slow and steady. We
got some stairs coming up.

660
00:55:26,757 --> 00:55:27,925
Mom?

661
00:55:28,593 --> 00:55:29,661
What happened?

662
00:55:29,794 --> 00:55:31,396
- Who are you?
- I'm her son.

663
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:33,107
- What happened?
- You can probably help us

664
00:55:33,131 --> 00:55:34,900
out inside. We don't
know what happened yet.

665
00:55:35,033 --> 00:55:36,644
- Hop in the back of the ambulance.
- -Step.

666
00:55:36,668 --> 00:55:37,845
One more.
We got one more lift.

667
00:55:37,869 --> 00:55:39,037
I'm getting

668
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,810
a little resistance here,
Michael.

669
00:55:43,107 --> 00:55:44,107
Lift.

670
00:55:49,547 --> 00:55:51,182
I'm right here.

671
00:55:51,315 --> 00:55:52,550
Excuse me, sir.

672
00:55:52,684 --> 00:55:53,761
Does your mother take
any medications?

673
00:55:53,785 --> 00:55:54,819
- No.
- Excuse me,

674
00:55:54,953 --> 00:55:56,655
- I couldn't hear you.
- No.

675
00:55:56,788 --> 00:55:57,931
Sir, when was the last
time you spoke to her?

676
00:55:57,955 --> 00:55:59,089
I don't know.

677
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:46,171
Mr. Fleck.

678
00:56:46,304 --> 00:56:48,406
Sorry to bother you.
I'm Detective Garrity.

679
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,976
This is my partner,
Detective Burke.

680
00:56:51,109 --> 00:56:54,044
We had a few questions for
you, but you weren't home,

681
00:56:55,446 --> 00:56:57,047
so we spoke with your mother.

682
00:56:58,849 --> 00:56:59,850
Oh.

683
00:57:00,785 --> 00:57:02,319
What did you say to her?

684
00:57:02,453 --> 00:57:03,454
Did you do this?

685
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,023
What? No.

686
00:57:05,156 --> 00:57:07,291
No, no, no. We just
asked her some questions,

687
00:57:07,425 --> 00:57:09,026
and she got hysterical.

688
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,762
Hyperventilating,

689
00:57:10,895 --> 00:57:12,340
collapsed and hit
her head pretty hard.

690
00:57:12,364 --> 00:57:14,799
Yeah. The doctor
said she had a stroke.

691
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:17,369
We're sorry to hear about that.

692
00:57:17,502 --> 00:57:20,571
But, like I said, I still have
some questions for you.

693
00:57:20,705 --> 00:57:21,949
They're about
the subway killings

694
00:57:21,973 --> 00:57:23,207
that happened last week.

695
00:57:23,341 --> 00:57:24,775
You've heard about them, right?

696
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:25,976
Yeah.

697
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,111
It's horrible.

698
00:57:27,244 --> 00:57:29,047
Right.

699
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:32,483
So, we spoke with your
boss over at Haha's.

700
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:34,585
He said you were fired
for bringing a gun

701
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:36,486
into the children's hospital.

702
00:57:37,689 --> 00:57:39,690
- Is that true, Mr. Fleck?
- It was a prop.

703
00:57:39,824 --> 00:57:41,659
It's part of my act.

704
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,061
I'm a party clown.

705
00:57:43,194 --> 00:57:45,529
All right. So, why
were you fired?

706
00:57:48,566 --> 00:57:51,202
They said I wasn't funny enough.

707
00:57:51,335 --> 00:57:53,104
Can you imagine that?

708
00:57:53,238 --> 00:57:57,108
If you don't mind, I have to
go take care of my mother.

709
00:57:57,242 --> 00:57:59,843
Your boss also gave
us one of your cards.

710
00:58:01,813 --> 00:58:04,281
This condition of yours,
the laughing,

711
00:58:05,082 --> 00:58:06,350
is it real,

712
00:58:06,484 --> 00:58:08,652
or some sort of clown thing?

713
00:58:08,786 --> 00:58:11,589
- A clown thing?
- Yeah.

714
00:58:11,723 --> 00:58:14,157
I mean, is it part of your act?

715
00:58:16,627 --> 00:58:18,095
What do you think?

716
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:25,102
It's exit only.

717
00:58:49,493 --> 00:58:51,695
She's gonna be okay.

718
00:58:55,867 --> 00:58:57,834
I'm gonna get a coffee.

719
00:58:58,402 --> 00:58:59,403
You want one?

720
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,737
Yeah.

721
00:59:13,552 --> 00:59:16,421
<i>So, the other night, I
told my youngest son Billy,</i>

722
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:19,857
<i>you know, the new one,
the not-so-bright one.</i>

723
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:21,525
<i>I told him, "The garbage strike</i>

724
00:59:21,659 --> 00:59:23,328
<i>is still going on, Billy."</i>

725
00:59:23,461 --> 00:59:25,301
<i>And he says, and I'm
not kidding, Billy says,</i>

726
00:59:25,397 --> 00:59:27,437
<i>"So, where are we gonna
get all our garbage from?"</i>

727
00:59:34,472 --> 00:59:36,974
<i>And finally, in a
world where everyone</i>

728
00:59:37,108 --> 00:59:38,543
<i>thinks they could do my job,</i>

729
00:59:38,676 --> 00:59:40,811
<i>we got this video tape
from Pogo's Comedy Club,</i>

730
00:59:40,945 --> 00:59:42,614
<i>right here in Gotham.</i>

731
00:59:42,747 --> 00:59:44,224
<i>Here's a guy who thinks
if you just keep laughing,</i>

732
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:46,651
<i>it'll somehow make you funny.</i>

733
00:59:46,784 --> 00:59:48,819
<i>Check out this joker.</i>

734
00:59:53,357 --> 00:59:54,759
Oh, my God.

735
00:59:54,893 --> 00:59:58,663
<i>I hated school as a kid.</i>

736
00:59:58,796 --> 01:00:01,833
<i>But my mother would always say,</i>

737
01:00:01,966 --> 01:00:03,535
<i>"You should enjoy it.</i>

738
01:00:03,668 --> 01:00:06,304
<i>One day, you'll have
to work for a living."</i>

739
01:00:06,437 --> 01:00:07,905
<i>"No, I won't, Ma.</i>

740
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:09,740
<i>I'm gonna be
a comedian."</i>

741
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,082
<i>You shoulda listened
to your mother.</i>

742
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:22,253
<i>Hey, one more.
One more, Bobby.</i>

743
01:00:22,387 --> 01:00:25,422
<i>All right, let's see one
more. I love this guy.</i>

744
01:00:25,556 --> 01:00:27,124
<i>It's funny,</i>

745
01:00:27,258 --> 01:00:29,360
<i>when I was a little boy</i>

746
01:00:29,494 --> 01:00:32,563
<i>and told people I was
gonna be a comedian,</i>

747
01:00:32,697 --> 01:00:34,732
<i>everyone laughed at me.</i>

748
01:00:34,866 --> 01:00:37,901
<i>Well, no one's laughing now.</i>

749
01:00:41,105 --> 01:00:43,007
<i>You can say that again, pal.</i>

750
01:00:48,647 --> 01:00:51,516
<i>All right, we got a great
show for you tonight.</i>

751
01:00:51,649 --> 01:00:54,986
<i>Chuck Conby is here,
actress Joanne Mulligan,</i>

752
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:59,189
<i>and new music from
Mel Rubin and the Stiffs.</i>

753
01:01:04,763 --> 01:01:07,399
<i>As tensions mount
around the metro area,</i>

754
01:01:07,532 --> 01:01:11,202
<i>Mayor Stokes has pleaded
for cooler heads to prevail.</i>

755
01:01:11,336 --> 01:01:13,004
<i>City services
have been affected,</i>

756
01:01:13,137 --> 01:01:15,072
<i>and some businesses
have decided</i>

757
01:01:15,206 --> 01:01:18,042
<i>to remain closed
amid the unrest.</i>

758
01:01:18,176 --> 01:01:20,845
<i>Chuck Stevens
filed this report.</i>

759
01:01:20,978 --> 01:01:22,413
<i>The anger and resentment</i>

760
01:01:22,547 --> 01:01:23,824
<i>that's been building
in the city for weeks</i>

761
01:01:23,848 --> 01:01:25,550
<i>seems close to exploding.</i>

762
01:01:25,683 --> 01:01:27,852
<i>Protesters, many
dressed as clowns,</i>

763
01:01:27,985 --> 01:01:29,487
<i>took to the streets today</i>

764
01:01:29,621 --> 01:01:31,131
<i>in one of several
planned demonstrations</i>

765

<i>taking on the city's elite,</i>

766

<i>including a massive rally
outside</i>

767

<i>tomorrow night's
benefit at Wayne Hall.</i>

768
01:01:37,262 --> 01:01:38,863
<i>What's the point of all this?</i>

769
01:01:38,997 --> 01:01:40,598
<i><font color="white">- the rich.
- Thomas Wayne.</i>

770
01:01:40,732 --> 01:01:42,566
<i>That's what this whole
<font color="white">thing is about.</i>

771
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,402
<i>the whole system.</i>

772
01:01:44,535 --> 01:01:45,736
<i>Wayne, who recently announced</i>

773
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:47,104
<i>he is running for mayor,</i>

774
01:01:47,238 --> 01:01:48,940
<i>will be attending the benefit.</i>

775
01:01:49,073 --> 01:01:51,075
<i>You might remember
it was Thomas Wayne</i>

776
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:52,577
<i>who first referred to</i>

777
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:55,413
<i>many of Gotham's residents
as "clowns."</i>

778
01:01:55,547 --> 01:01:58,749
<i>Today, he offered little
in the way of an apology.</i>

779
01:01:58,883 --> 01:02:00,251
<i>Well, what I will say is,</i>

780
01:02:00,385 --> 01:02:01,829
<i>there's something wrong
with those people.</i>

781
01:02:01,853 --> 01:02:03,187
<i>I am here to help them.</i>

782
01:02:03,321 --> 01:02:04,761
<i>I'm gonna
lift them out of poverty,</i>

783
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:06,089
<i>help make their lives better.</i>

784
01:02:06,157 --> 01:02:07,959
<i>That is why I'm running.</i>

785
01:02:08,093 --> 01:02:10,253
<i>And they may not realize
it, but I'm their only hope.</i>

786
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:28,212
Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!

787
01:02:28,346 --> 01:02:31,248
Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!

788
01:05:11,742 --> 01:05:13,009
Can I help you, pal?

789
01:05:15,012 --> 01:05:16,847
I don't know what to say.

790
01:05:20,251 --> 01:05:22,619
Do you want an
autograph or something?

791
01:05:22,753 --> 01:05:23,953
No.

792
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:31,494
My name is Arthur.

793
01:05:32,963 --> 01:05:34,664
Penny Fleck is my mother.

794
01:05:35,966 --> 01:05:37,702
Jesus.

795
01:05:37,835 --> 01:05:39,755
You're the guy that came
to my house yesterday.

796
01:05:41,238 --> 01:05:42,940
Yes.

797
01:05:43,073 --> 01:05:44,975
I'm sorry I just showed up.

798
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:46,410
But my mother
told me everything,

799
01:05:46,543 --> 01:05:48,279
and I had to talk to you.

800
01:05:48,412 --> 01:05:50,915
Look, pal, I'm not your father.

801
01:05:51,048 --> 01:05:52,615
What's wrong with you?

802
01:05:54,151 --> 01:05:55,985
Look at us.

803
01:05:57,187 --> 01:05:58,589
I think you are.

804
01:05:58,722 --> 01:06:00,224
Well, that's impossible

805
01:06:00,357 --> 01:06:01,525
because you're adopted,

806
01:06:01,659 --> 01:06:03,327
and I never slept with
your mother.

807
01:06:03,461 --> 01:06:04,704
- I wasn't adopted.
- What do you want from me?

808
01:06:04,728 --> 01:06:05,963
- Money?
- No, I don't...

809
01:06:06,096 --> 01:06:07,197
I wasn't adopted.

810
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:09,166
Jesus.
She never told you?

811
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:11,001
Told me what?

812
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:14,280
Your mother adopted you
while she was working for us.

813
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:15,973
That's not true.

814
01:06:16,106 --> 01:06:17,308
Why are you saying that?

815
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:18,451
Then she was arrested
and committed

816
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:19,610
to Arkham State Hospital,

817
01:06:19,743 --> 01:06:21,078
when you were just a little boy.

818
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:22,379
Why are you saying this?

819
01:06:22,513 --> 01:06:24,047
I don't need you to
tell me lies.

820
01:06:24,181 --> 01:06:25,416
I know it seems strange.

821
01:06:25,549 --> 01:06:27,218
I don't mean to
make you uncomfortable.

822
01:06:27,351 --> 01:06:29,019
I don't know why
everyone is so rude.

823
01:06:29,153 --> 01:06:30,321
I don't know why you are.

824
01:06:30,454 --> 01:06:31,856
I don't want anything from you.

825
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:34,358
Maybe a little bit of
warmth, maybe a hug, Dad!

826
01:06:34,492 --> 01:06:36,493
How about just a little
bit of fucking decency?

827
01:06:36,627 --> 01:06:38,128
What is it with you people?

828
01:06:38,262 --> 01:06:40,430
You say that stuff
about my mother.

829
01:06:40,564 --> 01:06:41,798
She's crazy.

830
01:06:41,932 --> 01:06:44,200
She's...

831
01:06:51,475 --> 01:06:53,176
You think this is funny?

832
01:06:54,478 --> 01:06:57,814
Dad, it's me.
Come on.

833
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:01,652
Touch my son again,

834
01:07:01,785 --> 01:07:03,286
I'll fucking kill you.

835
01:07:22,874 --> 01:07:25,676
<i>Hello, Mr. Fleck.
This is Detective Garrity.</i>

836
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:28,079
<i>We met the other night
at Gotham General.</i>

837
01:07:28,212 --> 01:07:30,448
<i>My partner and I had a
few more questions for you.</i>

838
01:07:30,582 --> 01:07:33,718
<i>We stopped by your apartment
today, but you weren't home.</i>

839
01:07:33,851 --> 01:07:35,853
<i>Please give me a call
when you get this message.</i>

840
01:07:35,986 --> 01:07:37,721
<i>Again, Detective Garrity,</i>

841
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:42,258
<i>and my number
is 212... 99.</i>

842
01:08:24,969 --> 01:08:26,970
<i>This message is
for Arthur Fleck.</i>

843
01:08:27,104 --> 01:08:28,606
<i>My name is Shirley Woods.</i>

844
01:08:28,739 --> 01:08:31,075
<i>I work on
The Murray Franklin Show.</i>

845
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:32,576
<i>I don't know if you're aware,</i>

846
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:34,020
<i>but Murray played
a clip of your stand-up</i>

847
01:08:34,044 --> 01:08:35,913
<i>on the show recently,</i>

848
01:08:36,047 --> 01:08:38,328
<i>and we have gotten an amazing
response from our viewers.</i>

849
01:08:38,383 --> 01:08:41,150
<i>Murray asked me to give
you a call and see if you're...</i>

850
01:08:45,288 --> 01:08:46,557
Who is this?

851
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:48,392
<i>Oh, hi, this is Shirley Woods.</i>

852
01:08:48,526 --> 01:08:51,361
<i>I'm the show booker from
</i>Live with Murray Franklin.

853
01:08:51,495 --> 01:08:52,729
<i>Is this Arthur?</i>

854
01:08:54,731 --> 01:08:56,033
Yes.

855
01:08:56,167 --> 01:08:57,935
<i>Hi, Arthur. Well,
as I was saying,</i>

856
01:08:58,069 --> 01:08:59,903
<i>we've gotten a lot of
calls about your clip.</i>

857
01:09:00,037 --> 01:09:01,672
<i>Amazing responses.</i>

858
01:09:01,806 --> 01:09:03,908
<i>And Murray asked if I
would reach out to you</i>

859
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:05,942
<i>to see if you would
come on as his guest.</i>

860
01:09:10,981 --> 01:09:14,284
Murray wants me
on The Murray Franklin Show?

861
01:09:14,418 --> 01:09:16,220
<i>Yeah.
Isn't that great?</i>

862
01:09:16,354 --> 01:09:19,990
<i>He'd love to talk to you,
maybe do some of your act?</i>

863
01:09:20,124 --> 01:09:22,458
<i>That sound good to you?</i>

864
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:28,566
Yeah, that sounds great.

865
01:09:28,699 --> 01:09:30,501
<i>Can we set up a date right now?</i>

866
01:09:30,634 --> 01:09:32,602
<i>Are you available
next Thursday?</i>

867
01:10:25,188 --> 01:10:26,724
Hey.

868
01:10:26,857 --> 01:10:29,827
Man, I'm sorry
about that, my man.

869
01:10:29,961 --> 01:10:32,172
All records 10 years or older,
they store in the basement,

870
01:10:32,196 --> 01:10:35,598
and you're talking about
something 30 years ago, so...

871
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,868
Can I ask you a question?

872
01:10:39,002 --> 01:10:40,504
Sure.

873
01:10:40,637 --> 01:10:45,509
How does someone
wind up in here?

874
01:10:45,643 --> 01:10:49,613
Have they all, all the
people committed crimes?

875
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:51,481
Well, yeah, some have.

876
01:10:51,615 --> 01:10:54,518
You know, some are just crazy.

877
01:10:54,651 --> 01:10:57,221
Pose dangers to
themselves and others.

878
01:10:57,354 --> 01:10:58,756
Some just got
nowhere else to go.

879
01:10:58,889 --> 01:11:00,958
Don't know what to do, you know?

880
01:11:01,091 --> 01:11:04,762
-Yeah. I hear you, brother.
-Hmm.

881
01:11:04,895 --> 01:11:09,066
Sometimes, I don't
know what to do.

882
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:13,170
Last time, I ended up
taking it out on some people.

883
01:11:13,304 --> 01:11:17,407
I thought it was gonna
bother me, but it really hasn't.

884
01:11:18,475 --> 01:11:19,675
What's that?

885
01:11:20,911 --> 01:11:24,347
I fucked up and
did some bad shit.

886
01:11:28,352 --> 01:11:29,887
You know what I'm talking about,

887
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:34,991
it's so hard to just try
and be happy all the time.

888
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:39,496
Hey, listen, man.

889
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:41,131
I'm just
an administrative assistant.

890
01:11:41,265 --> 01:11:42,666
Like a clerk, you know.

891
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:44,667
All I do is file paperwork.

892
01:11:45,569 --> 01:11:47,337
I don't know what to tell you.

893
01:11:47,471 --> 01:11:49,306
But you should see somebody.

894
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:50,574
You know, they got programs,

895
01:11:50,707 --> 01:11:53,343
city services, stuff like that.

896
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:54,778
Oh, yeah.

897
01:11:54,912 --> 01:11:56,612
They cut all those.

898
01:12:01,552 --> 01:12:03,553
All right, here it is. Fleck.

899
01:12:03,687 --> 01:12:06,423
Penny Fleck.
Let's see.

900
01:12:06,557 --> 01:12:11,328
Diagnosed by
Dr. Benjamin Stoner.

901
01:12:11,462 --> 01:12:15,699
Oh. "The patient suffers
from delusional psychosis

902
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:19,736
and narcissistic
personality disorder." Mmm.

903
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:21,571
"Was found guilty of endangering

904
01:12:21,705 --> 01:12:25,441
the welfare
of her own child."

905
01:12:33,483 --> 01:12:34,684
What?

906
01:12:37,821 --> 01:12:39,589
You said she's your mother.

907
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,030
Uh...

908
01:12:46,163 --> 01:12:48,041
I'm sorry, man. Like I said, I
can't release these records,

909
01:12:48,065 --> 01:12:51,301
you know, without proper forms.

910
01:12:51,435 --> 01:12:53,671
I could get in trouble.

911
01:12:53,804 --> 01:12:56,039
Look, if you want to bring
your mom in here to sign,

912
01:12:56,173 --> 01:12:57,775
that'll be much easier,

913
01:12:57,908 --> 01:13:00,343
but I can't let this go
without her signature, okay?

914
01:13:00,477 --> 01:13:01,677
I'm sorry.

915
01:13:05,615 --> 01:13:08,318
No, man! Shit!

916
01:13:08,452 --> 01:13:10,553
Come on, man.
Give it...

917
01:13:11,287 --> 01:13:13,723
Hey! Hey!

918
01:14:11,482 --> 01:14:15,152
<i>We went over this, Penny.
You adopted him.</i>

919
01:14:15,286 --> 01:14:17,654
<i>We have all the
paperwork right here.</i>

920
01:14:17,788 --> 01:14:19,990
<i>That's not true.</i>

921
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:22,492
Thomas had that all made up,

922
01:14:22,626 --> 01:14:25,528
so it stayed our secret.

923
01:14:27,064 --> 01:14:29,966
<i>You also stood by</i>

924
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,501
while one of your boyfriends

925
01:14:31,635 --> 01:14:35,204
repeatedly abused
your adopted son

926
01:14:36,506 --> 01:14:37,707
and battered you.

927
01:14:57,327 --> 01:14:59,129
Penny,

928
01:14:59,263 --> 01:15:03,166
your son was found
tied to a radiator

929
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:05,636
in your filthy apartment.

930
01:15:05,769 --> 01:15:08,371
Malnourished with multiple
bruises across his body

931
01:15:08,505 --> 01:15:10,440
and severe trauma to his head.

932
01:15:12,443 --> 01:15:15,012
I never heard him cry.

933
01:15:15,145 --> 01:15:18,914
He's always been
such a happy little boy.

934
01:17:19,803 --> 01:17:21,337
It's time for bed.

935
01:17:24,741 --> 01:17:26,376
Oh, my God!

936
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:28,711
What are you doing in here?

937
01:17:30,881 --> 01:17:32,982
You're in the wrong apartment.

938
01:17:39,489 --> 01:17:41,624
Your name's Arthur, right?

939
01:17:41,758 --> 01:17:43,125
You live down the hall.

940
01:17:46,096 --> 01:17:48,130
I really need you to leave.

941
01:17:52,169 --> 01:17:55,337
My little girl is sleeping
in the other room.

942
01:18:00,443 --> 01:18:01,710
Please.

943
01:18:04,247 --> 01:18:06,448
I had a bad day.

944
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:11,921
Can I call someone?
Is your mother home?

945
01:19:37,941 --> 01:19:39,809
Shut up!

946
01:19:58,861 --> 01:20:00,396
Hey, Penny.

947
01:20:02,765 --> 01:20:04,233
Penny Fleck.

948
01:20:12,175 --> 01:20:14,243
I always hated that name.

949
01:20:17,547 --> 01:20:19,882
You know how you used to tell me

950
01:20:21,518 --> 01:20:24,420
that my laugh was a condition?

951
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:28,123
That there was
something wrong with me?

952
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:32,361
There isn't.

953
01:20:35,064 --> 01:20:37,066
That's the real me.

954
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,001
Happy.

955
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:43,539
Happy. Hmm.

956
01:20:46,809 --> 01:20:49,379
I haven't been happy

957
01:20:49,512 --> 01:20:52,114
one minute of
my entire fucking life.

958
01:20:58,888 --> 01:21:00,422
You know what's funny?

959
01:21:03,026 --> 01:21:05,060
You know what really
makes me laugh?

960
01:21:07,164 --> 01:21:09,898
I used to think that
my life was a tragedy...

961
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:13,503
but now I realize

962
01:21:13,636 --> 01:21:15,304
it's a fucking comedy.

963
01:22:25,541 --> 01:22:27,177
<i>A very fine actor.</i>

964
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:29,813
<i>He's got a new movie

Hey, Murray.

Thank you so much for
having me on the show.

974
01:23:08,551 --> 01:23:11,053
It's been a lifelong

01:23:33,276 --> 01:23:35,043
I'm sorry.
What's that?

979
01:23:36,145 --> 01:23:38,180
Oh, that's very funny, Murray.

980
01:23:39,215 --> 01:23:41,350
You know, I'm also a comedian.

981
01:23:41,484 --> 01:23:42,852
Would you like to hear a joke?

982
01:23:44,087 --> 01:23:46,722
Yeah?
All of you?

983
01:23:46,856 --> 01:23:48,056
Okay.

Knock...

985
01:23:52,028 --> 01:23:53,328
Knock, knock.

986
01:24:07,043 --> 01:24:08,477
Knock, knock.

987
01:26:05,761 --> 01:26:06,828
Coming.

988
01:26:17,907 --> 01:26:19,241
Hey, Arthur.

989
01:26:19,375 --> 01:26:20,575
How's it going?

990
01:26:21,377 --> 01:26:23,112
Oh, hey, guys.

991
01:26:23,245 --> 01:26:24,580
Come on in.

992
01:26:24,714 --> 01:26:26,214
Did you get a new gig?

993
01:26:26,782 --> 01:26:28,184
No.

994
01:26:28,318 --> 01:26:31,554
Oh, you must be going
down to that rally at City Hall.

995
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:33,422
I hear it's gonna be nuts.

996
01:26:33,556 --> 01:26:35,424
Oh, is that today?

997
01:26:35,991 --> 01:26:37,593
Yeah.

998
01:26:37,727 --> 01:26:39,461
What's with the makeup then?

999
01:26:40,830 --> 01:26:42,231
My mom died.

1000
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:43,732
I'm celebrating.

1001
01:26:44,467 --> 01:26:45,468
Right. We heard.

1002
01:26:45,601 --> 01:26:47,237
That's why we came by.

1003
01:26:47,370 --> 01:26:50,039
We figured, you know, you
could use some cheering up.

1004
01:26:50,172 --> 01:26:51,874
Aw, that's sweet.

1005
01:26:52,008 --> 01:26:55,411
But, no, I feel good.

1006
01:26:55,545 --> 01:26:57,246
Yeah, I stopped
taking my medication.

1007
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:59,281
I feel a lot better now.

1008
01:27:01,184 --> 01:27:03,785
Oh, okay.
Good for you.

1009
01:27:05,688 --> 01:27:08,591
So, hey, listen, I don't
know if you heard,

1010
01:27:08,725 --> 01:27:11,728
but the cops have been
coming around the shop,

1011
01:27:11,861 --> 01:27:15,765
talking to all the guys
about those subway murders.

1012
01:27:15,899 --> 01:27:17,933
- And, um...
- They didn't talk to me.

1013
01:27:19,702 --> 01:27:22,739
That's because the suspect
was a regular-sized person.

1014
01:27:22,873 --> 01:27:25,674
If it was a fucking midget,
you'd be in jail right now.

1015
01:27:31,313 --> 01:27:32,515
Anyway, um,

1016
01:27:32,648 --> 01:27:36,652
Hoyt said that
they talked to you,

1017
01:27:36,786 --> 01:27:38,154
and now they're looking for me,

1018
01:27:38,287 --> 01:27:39,807
and I just wanna know
what you said.

1019
01:27:39,889 --> 01:27:41,624
Make sure our stories line up.

1020
01:27:41,758 --> 01:27:44,594
- Seeing as how you're my boy.
- Yeah, that's important.

1021
01:27:44,728 --> 01:27:46,572
- That makes a lot of sense.
- You know what I mean?

1022
01:27:46,596 --> 01:27:48,664
Thank you, Randall.
Thank you so much.

1023
01:27:54,170 --> 01:27:55,571
Arthur!

1024
01:27:55,705 --> 01:27:57,372
No!

1025
01:27:58,440 --> 01:27:59,641
What?

1026
01:28:00,909 --> 01:28:01,910
No!

1027
01:28:09,652 --> 01:28:11,721
Why would you do that, Arthur?

1028
01:28:32,775 --> 01:28:34,844
Do you watch
The Murray Franklin Show?

1029
01:28:34,977 --> 01:28:36,711
Yeah.

1030
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:39,882
I'm gonna be on tonight.

1031
01:28:43,853 --> 01:28:45,788
It fucking crazy, innit?

1032
01:28:45,921 --> 01:28:47,789
Me on the telly.

1033
01:28:49,625 --> 01:28:51,793
What the fuck, Arthur?

1034
01:28:52,795 --> 01:28:54,062
What?

1035
01:28:59,068 --> 01:29:00,469
It's okay, Gary.

1036
01:29:00,603 --> 01:29:01,870
You can go.

1037
01:29:04,273 --> 01:29:05,974
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1038
01:29:08,944 --> 01:29:10,379
Oh!

1039
01:29:10,513 --> 01:29:12,781
Don't look.
Just go.

1040
01:29:25,227 --> 01:29:26,428
Fuck.

1041
01:29:31,467 --> 01:29:32,801
Hey, Arthur?

1042
01:29:32,935 --> 01:29:34,771
Yeah?

1043
01:29:34,904 --> 01:29:37,639
Arthur, can you get the lock?

1044
01:29:40,609 --> 01:29:42,044
Shit.

1045
01:29:42,177 --> 01:29:43,745
Sorry, Gary.

1046
01:29:54,523 --> 01:29:55,757
Gary?

1047
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:56,892
Yeah.

1048
01:29:59,128 --> 01:30:01,997
You were the only one
that was ever nice to me.

1049

Skedaddle.

1050
01:31:32,421 --> 01:31:33,689
Hey, Arthur!

1051
01:31:33,822 --> 01:31:35,390
We need to talk.

1052
01:31:35,524 --> 01:31:36,558
Oh!

1053
01:31:36,692 --> 01:31:38,893
Hey! Stop, Arthur!

Hey, hey, hey.
It's Mr. Franklin, buddy.

1095
01:35:19,014 --> 01:35:21,516
Oh, come on, Gene.
That's all bullshit.

Thank you, Murray.

I feel like I know you.

1098

I've been watching you forever.

1099
01:35:29,324 --> 01:35:30,425
Thank you.

1100
01:35:30,559 --> 01:35:31,860
What's with the face?

1101
01:35:31,994 --> 01:35:34,095
I mean, are you
part of the protest?

1102

No.

1103

No, I don't believe
in any of that.

1104
01:35:37,733 --> 01:35:39,568
I don't believe in anything.

1105
01:35:39,702 --> 01:35:41,537
I just thought it'd
be good for my act.

1106
01:35:41,670 --> 01:35:43,239
For your act?
Didn't you hear

1107
01:35:43,372 --> 01:35:45,050
what happened on the
subway? Some clown got killed.

1108
01:35:45,074 --> 01:35:46,484
He's aware of that.
He's aware of that. Yeah.

1109
01:35:46,508 --> 01:35:47,943
No, I hadn't heard.

1110
01:35:48,077 --> 01:35:49,278
- Yeah.
- You see? This is

1111
01:35:49,411 --> 01:35:50,922
what I'm telling you.
The audience is

1112
01:35:50,946 --> 01:35:52,190
gonna go crazy
if you put this guy on.

1113
01:35:52,214 --> 01:35:53,949
Maybe for a bit,
but not a whole segment.

1114
01:35:54,083 --> 01:35:56,752
Gene, it's gonna work.
It's gonna work.

1115
01:35:56,886 --> 01:35:59,421
We're gonna go with it.

Couple rules, though.

No cursing.
No off-color material.

- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1121
01:36:07,196 --> 01:36:08,697
You'll go on
right after Dr. Sally.

1122
01:36:08,830 --> 01:36:09,832
I love Dr. Sally.

Good, good.
Someone will

- Okay. Perfect.

1125
01:36:13,769 --> 01:36:14,803
Good luck.

- Okay.

- Yeah.

1128
01:36:20,409 --> 01:36:22,144
When you bring me out,

1129
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:24,179
can you introduce me as Joker?

1130
01:36:24,313 --> 01:36:26,448
What's wrong
with your real name?

1131
01:36:26,582 --> 01:36:29,184
That's what you
called me on the show.

1132
01:36:29,317 --> 01:36:30,418
A joker.

1133
01:36:30,552 --> 01:36:31,720
Do you remember?

1134
01:36:31,854 --> 01:36:33,656
- Did I?
- I don't know.

1135
01:36:33,789 --> 01:36:36,258
Well, if you say so,
kid, you know, Joker it is.

1136
01:36:36,391 --> 01:36:37,392
It's good.

1137
01:36:37,526 --> 01:36:38,593
Thanks, Murray.

1138
01:37:00,449 --> 01:37:02,017
I'll try it, you know,

1139
01:37:02,151 --> 01:37:03,911
but I'm not sure my
wife will let me do it.

1140
01:37:05,187 --> 01:37:06,522
Maybe my next wife.

1141
01:37:10,226 --> 01:37:12,027
You gotta see our
next guest for yourself.

1142
01:37:12,161 --> 01:37:14,329
I'm pretty sure this
guy could use a doctor.

1143
01:37:14,463 --> 01:37:15,664
Oh!

1144
01:37:15,798 --> 01:37:17,433
Does he have sexual problems?

1145
01:37:17,567 --> 01:37:19,634
Oh, he looks like he's
got a lot of problems.

1146
01:37:21,504 --> 01:37:23,664
All right, Bobby, let's
show that clip one last time.

1147
01:37:29,712 --> 01:37:33,014
<i>I hated school as a kid.</i>

1148
01:37:34,450 --> 01:37:37,486
<i>But my mother would always say,</i>

1149
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:39,388
<i>"You should enjoy it.</i>

1150
01:37:39,522 --> 01:37:42,191
<i>One day, you'll have
to work for a living."</i>

1151
01:37:42,324 --> 01:37:43,459
<i>"No, I won't, Ma.</i>

1152
01:37:43,592 --> 01:37:45,627
<i>I'm gonna be
a comedian."</i>

1153
01:37:51,734 --> 01:37:55,404
- Okay.
- You may...

1154
01:37:55,538 --> 01:37:58,741
You may have seen
that clip of our next guest.

1155
01:37:58,874 --> 01:38:01,376
Now, before he comes
out, I just want to say

1156
01:38:01,510 --> 01:38:03,045
that we're all heartbroken

1157
01:38:03,179 --> 01:38:05,147
about what's going on
in the city tonight.

1158
01:38:05,281 --> 01:38:07,516
But this is how he
wanted to come out,

1159
01:38:07,650 --> 01:38:11,019
and honestly, I think we
could all use a good laugh.

1160
01:38:11,153 --> 01:38:14,323
So, please welcome, Joker.

1161
01:38:55,998 --> 01:38:57,232
Are you all right, Doctor?

1162
01:39:01,170 --> 01:39:03,738
Well, that was
quite an entrance.

1163
01:39:10,178 --> 01:39:11,379
You okay?

1164
01:39:14,049 --> 01:39:15,384
Yeah.

1165
01:39:15,517 --> 01:39:18,486
This is exactly
how I imagined it.

1166
01:39:20,255 --> 01:39:22,023
Well, that makes one of us.

1167
01:39:28,797 --> 01:39:31,132
So, can you tell us
about this look?

1168
01:39:31,266 --> 01:39:32,868
When we spoke earlier,

1169
01:39:33,002 --> 01:39:34,879
you mentioned that this look
is not a political statement.

1170
01:39:34,903 --> 01:39:36,171
Is that right?

1171
01:39:36,305 --> 01:39:37,682
That's right, Murray.
I'm not political.

1172
01:39:37,706 --> 01:39:40,342
I'm just trying to
make people laugh.

1173
01:39:40,476 --> 01:39:42,677
And how's that going for you?

1174
01:39:50,552 --> 01:39:52,421
So, I know you're a comedian.

1175
01:39:52,554 --> 01:39:54,356
You been working on
any new material?

1176
01:39:54,489 --> 01:39:55,790
You wanna tell us a joke?

1177
01:40:01,563 --> 01:40:02,563
Yeah?

1178
01:40:04,699 --> 01:40:05,700
Okay.

1179
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:13,441
He's got a book.

1180
01:40:14,175 --> 01:40:15,743
A book of jokes.

1181
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:27,122
Take your time.
We got all night.

1182
01:40:32,961 --> 01:40:35,396
Okay, okay.
Here's one.

1183
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:40,902
Knock, knock.

1184
01:40:41,036 --> 01:40:42,437
And you had to look that up?

1185
01:40:49,411 --> 01:40:51,312
I want to get it right.

1186
01:40:52,981 --> 01:40:54,616
Knock, knock.

1187
01:40:54,749 --> 01:40:56,350
Who's there?

1188
01:40:57,519 --> 01:40:59,054
It's the police, ma'am.

1189
01:40:59,188 --> 01:41:00,856
Your son's been hit
by a drunk driver.

1190
01:41:00,989 --> 01:41:04,025
He's dead.

1191
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:07,129
Oh, no, no, no.

1192
01:41:07,262 --> 01:41:09,064
No, you cannot joke about that.

1193
01:41:09,197 --> 01:41:10,966
Yeah, that's not funny, Arthur.

1194
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:14,202
That's not that kind of
humor we do on this show.

1195
01:41:14,336 --> 01:41:16,572
Okay. I'm...
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1196
01:41:16,706 --> 01:41:21,142
It's just, you know, it's been
a rough few weeks, Murray.

1197
01:41:22,877 --> 01:41:24,745
Ever since

1198
01:41:26,982 --> 01:41:29,484
I killed those three
Wall Street guys.

1199
01:41:35,757 --> 01:41:38,125
Okay, I'm waiting
for the punch line.

1200
01:41:39,327 --> 01:41:41,295
There is no punch line.

1201
01:41:42,431 --> 01:41:44,532
It's not a joke.

1202
01:41:49,071 --> 01:41:50,191
You're serious, aren't you?

1203
01:41:50,272 --> 01:41:51,472
You're telling us you killed

1204
01:41:51,573 --> 01:41:52,750
those three young men
on the subway?

1205
01:41:52,774 --> 01:41:53,642
Mmm-hmm.

1206
01:41:53,775 --> 01:41:55,477
And why should we believe you?

1207
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:57,778
I got nothing left to lose.

1208
01:41:59,581 --> 01:42:01,816
Nothing can hurt me anymore.

1209
01:42:04,753 --> 01:42:08,189
My life is nothing but a comedy.

1210
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:12,661
Well, let me get this straight,

1211
01:42:12,795 --> 01:42:14,862
you think that killing
those guys is funny?

1212
01:42:15,597 --> 01:42:16,798
I do.

1213
01:42:16,932 --> 01:42:19,634
And I'm tired of
pretending it's not.

1214
01:42:19,768 --> 01:42:22,103
Comedy is subjective, Murray.

1215
01:42:22,237 --> 01:42:24,005
Isn't that what they say?

1216
01:42:24,139 --> 01:42:25,740
All of you,

1217
01:42:25,874 --> 01:42:28,543
the system that knows so much,

1218
01:42:28,677 --> 01:42:31,447
you decide
what's right or wrong.

1219
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:36,585
The same way that you
decide what's funny or not!

1220
01:42:38,219 --> 01:42:39,688
Get him off!

1221
01:42:39,822 --> 01:42:43,692
Well, okay, I think
I might understand

1222
01:42:43,825 --> 01:42:45,360
that you did this to
start a movement,

1223
01:42:45,493 --> 01:42:48,062
to become a symbol?

1224
01:42:48,196 --> 01:42:49,631
Come on, Murray.

1225
01:42:49,765 --> 01:42:51,045
Do I look like the kind of clown

1226
01:42:51,166 --> 01:42:52,634
that could start a movement?

1227
01:42:52,768 --> 01:42:55,637
I killed those guys
because they were awful.

1228
01:42:55,771 --> 01:42:58,373
Everybody is awful these days.

1229
01:42:58,507 --> 01:43:00,742
It's enough to
make anyone crazy.

1230
01:43:00,876 --> 01:43:02,678
Okay.
So, that's it, you're crazy.

1231
01:43:02,811 --> 01:43:05,446
That's your defense for
killing three young men?

1232
01:43:05,947 --> 01:43:07,449
No.

1233
01:43:07,583 --> 01:43:11,152
They couldn't carry a
tune to save their lives.

1234
01:43:12,855 --> 01:43:16,758
Oh, why is everybody so
upset about these guys?

1235
01:43:16,892 --> 01:43:18,627
If it was me
dying on the sidewalk,

1236
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:20,262
you'd walk right over me!

1237
01:43:20,395 --> 01:43:22,497
I pass you every day,
and you don't notice me.

1238
01:43:22,631 --> 01:43:24,766
But these guys, what,
because Thomas Wayne

1239
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:26,535
went and cried about them on TV?

1240
01:43:26,668 --> 01:43:28,903
You have a problem
with Thomas Wayne, too?

1241
01:43:29,037 --> 01:43:30,773
Yes, I do.

1242
01:43:30,906 --> 01:43:34,443
Have you seen what
it's like out there, Murray?

1243
01:43:34,576 --> 01:43:37,613
Do you ever actually
leave the studio?

1244
01:43:37,746 --> 01:43:41,816
Everybody just yells and
screams at each other.

1245
01:43:41,950 --> 01:43:43,886
Nobody's civil anymore.

1246
01:43:44,019 --> 01:43:48,190
Nobody thinks what it's
like to be the other guy.

1247
01:43:48,323 --> 01:43:51,293
You think men like
Thomas Wayne ever think

1248
01:43:51,426 --> 01:43:53,395
what it's like to be
someone like me?

1249
01:43:53,529 --> 01:43:56,331
To be somebody but
themselves? They don't.

1250
01:43:56,465 --> 01:43:58,500
They think that
we'll just sit there

1251
01:43:58,633 --> 01:44:01,236
and take it,
like good little boys!

1252
01:44:01,370 --> 01:44:03,438
That we won't werewolf
and go wild!

1253
01:44:03,571 --> 01:44:05,073
You finished?

1254
01:44:05,207 --> 01:44:07,676
I mean, it's so much
self-pity, Arthur.

1255
01:44:07,809 --> 01:44:09,377
You sound like
you're making excuses

1256
01:44:09,511 --> 01:44:10,845
for killing those young men.

1257
01:44:10,979 --> 01:44:12,981
Not everybody,
and I'll tell you this,

1258
01:44:13,114 --> 01:44:14,648
not everyone is awful.

1259
01:44:16,685 --> 01:44:18,052
You're awful, Murray.

1260
01:44:18,186 --> 01:44:20,088
Me? I'm awful?

1261
01:44:20,222 --> 01:44:22,022
Oh, yeah, how am I awful?

1262
01:44:24,159 --> 01:44:25,726
Playing my video.

1263
01:44:26,862 --> 01:44:29,698
Inviting me on this show.

1264
01:44:29,831 --> 01:44:33,168
You just wanted to
make fun of me.

1265
01:44:33,301 --> 01:44:35,070
You're just like
the rest of them.

1266
01:44:35,204 --> 01:44:37,139
You don't know the
first thing about me, pal.

1267
01:44:37,273 --> 01:44:40,141
Look what happened, because
of what you did. What it led to.

1268
01:44:40,275 --> 01:44:41,843
There are riots out there.

1269
01:44:41,977 --> 01:44:43,537
Two policemen are
in critical condition,

1270
01:44:43,612 --> 01:44:44,912
and you're laughing.

1271
01:44:45,046 --> 01:44:46,615
You're laughing.

1272
01:44:46,749 --> 01:44:49,159
Someone was killed today,
because of what you did.

1273
01:44:49,183 --> 01:44:50,751
I know.

1274
01:44:53,021 --> 01:44:54,556
How about another joke, Murray?

1275
01:44:54,690 --> 01:44:56,134
No, I think we've had
enough of your jokes.

1276
01:44:56,158 --> 01:44:57,702
- What do you get...
- I don't think so.

1277
01:44:57,726 --> 01:45:00,295
When you cross
a mentally-ill loner

1278
01:45:00,428 --> 01:45:02,697
with a society that abandons him

1279
01:45:02,831 --> 01:45:04,065
and treats him like trash?

1280
01:45:04,199 --> 01:45:05,634
Call the police, Gene!

1281
01:45:05,767 --> 01:45:06,944
- I'll tell you what you get!
- Call the police.

1282
01:45:06,968 --> 01:45:08,636
You get what you
fucking deserve!

1283
01:45:44,873 --> 01:45:48,409
