1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,600
Emma, you're damn beautiful.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,600
It's Magnus' birthday on Saturday. I and Mahdi
are planning to arrange something cool for him.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,570
Yes! I'm all in, man!

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,770
I've talked to Sonja, and she was wondering
whether we could pre-drink at your place.

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,400
Stop monitoring me.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,820
Let's go!

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,820
Uhm, where?

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,940
Anywhere...

9
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:39,970
- Which one was it?
- It's just a Nicolas Cage movie... in which he doesn't overplay.

10
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,020
- Is that even possible?
- I think so...

11
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,110
I actually think life is like a movie. That one
can sort of be the director of one's own life.

12
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,220
Do you get what I mean?

13
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,250
- I do... I don't quite agree, though.
- You don't agree?

14
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:06,370
- Nah... What's really interesting is the infinity.
- What?

15
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:15,140
All the parallel universes, and all, kind of, how big everything is, and how
small we are compared to the infinite parallel universes that exist, and...

16
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:21,740
<b>everything</b> that <i>can</i> happen is going to happen.
Or not just <i>going</i> to happen it <b>is</b> happening.

17
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:32,840
I'm sure that in a parallel universe there's an Isak and an Even who're
lying in the exact same way in the exact same place, only, like...

18
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,900
The curtains are of a
different color or something...

19
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,120
So... yellow curtains, then?

20
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,420
Yeah.

21
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,780
No...

22
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,740
- I think you've had enough jay now.
- Haven't you ever thought about that?

23
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,320
Yeah, but I'm just starting to feel so...
I don't know, lonely.

24
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,820
- It's so interesting, though!

25
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,520
No, I don't like it, man.

26
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,320
- Why not?
- I don't know.

27
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,140
It often freaks me out.

28
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,400
- Jesus, in what way? It freaks you out?
- Not freaked out like you get from watching horror movies, but...

29
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,220
Like... Feeling alone, that
sort of freaked out, I guess.

30
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:34,720
That like... it's your head... it's you and
your head... and all of your thoughts.

31
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,720
- Alone in your head, what do you mean?
- A "The Mind is Alone" feeling.

32
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,680
A, <b>what</b> feeling? The mind is alone?

33
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,900
Because the only thing that exists is you and your
thoughts, right? You can't escape from your own thoughts.

34
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,360
The only way to do that is to die.

35
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,420
That's dark, though.

36
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,560
- Yeah, but haven't you ever thought about that?
- No.

37
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,560
Jeez! I'd forgotten how young you are, man!

38
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,480
What is it?

39
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,500
Are you just going to spend
your whole day in there?

40
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,600
I'm sleeping!!!

41
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,160
Okey...? Whose shoes are
those in the hallway?

42
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,900
They're... they're Jonas'. I borrowed them.

43
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,860
- Okay...
- Damn... Fucking babysitter, man.

44
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,940
How did you end up in this flatshare?

45
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:52,460
I... It was actually just... hehe... There was this one night
when I was fucking shitfaced drunk and then I met Eskild...

46
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,500
- Okay... So, he seduced you, then?
- No!

47
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,240
Or, what the fuck do <b>I</b> know,
I actually don't remember.

48
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,680
I think he just felt sorry for me, because
I was completely blacked out, and...

49
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:16,640
my dad had just left my mom, you know.
So... yeah.

50
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,320
He... The thing was, I
didn't want to go home.

51
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,100
So, he brought... me here.
And then, blah, blah, blah.

52
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,280
Okay, blah, blah blah. Good story.

53
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,600
- You can have it. Make a movie.
- I <b>am</b> going to make a movie about you.

54
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,300
Okay...

55
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,700
- Do you wanna know what it's called?

56
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,700
- Yeah.

57
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,220
"The Boy Who Couldn't Manage to
Hold His Breath Under Water."

58
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,060
That sounds like a pompous,
totally shitty movie!

59
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:05,580
Yeah, and anyway, I <b>can</b>, in fact, hold my breath under
water. But I just got a drop of water in my throat.

60
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,640
- Drop of water in your throat, is it? Yeah.
- Yeah...

61
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,740
So, that's that.

62
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,220
I'm <b>so</b> fucked right now.

63
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,620
Can't I just...

64
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,660
stay in here with you forever?

65
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,240
Can I?

66
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,760
You can...

67
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:04,720
YOU ARE HOT ❤ DROP OF WATER → AT THE SAME TIME,
AT A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE.

68
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,360
Hey!

69
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,360
Hello.

70
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,200
What are you doing?

71
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,980
- I'm cleaning...
- Good morning!

72
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,760
The wall...?

73
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,380
Yes, that's...

74
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,200
- So... hi, good morning, Isak!
- Good morning! -So...

75
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
That guy Even was really cool!

76
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,560
- Oh, you met him?
- Ye... I mean... yeah!

77
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,580
{

78
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,340
In the bathroom this morning.

79
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,720
So, yeah, wh... who's that?

80
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,700
Uhm, just a bud... buddy.

81
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,460
Okay...?

82
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,920
- Excuse me, isn't Even at school today?
- No, I haven't seen Even today.

83
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:43,640
- And it's <b>inside</b>.
- No, but it's not inside. It's in a sort of room, by the side.

84
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:49,180
- - Because when we got closer to her, she had sort of...
<b>stubble</b> in the face. -She wasn't a full ten, but... -A girl?!

85
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,080
- Yeah, didn't you see her?
- No! -It was on <b>your</b> birthday, though.

86
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,800
- Yeah, I know, but I was so fucking stressed...
- Fuck!!!

87
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,500
You had your birthday.. Sorry, bro!

88
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,480
Yeah, I... Congrats!

89
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,780
- Thanks.
- You're 17 now, man!

90
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:17,080
I was at this fucking family
gathering, man... So boring...

91
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,880
- So what happened, guys?
- Well, these dudes hooked me up with Vilde, you know.

92
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,280
- No?!! Did you hook up?

93
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,440
- No, almost.
- Right, almost!

94
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,720
- That <b>was</b> almost, what the fuck!!!
- Yes, yes, that <b>was</b> almost. -Huh, what happened?

95
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,700
No, it was just... It
was a long story, bro.

96
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,750
- But, that girl with a mustache...
- Oh, fucking hell... -I don't believe you, a mustache, I saw...

97
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:47,120
You <b>had</b> to have seen her! I mean, like, when you,
like, got close to kiss her, <b>that's</b> when you noticed.

98
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,000
- Why kiss a girl if she has a mustache?!
- Because she <b>was</b> fucking hot!!

99
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,630
But when you got close, you're not
keen on <i>[incomprehensible]</i> right!

100
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,790
- Yeah, right?
- <i>[incomprehensible]</i> stubbles in the face.

101
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,320
Fuck!

102
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,840
WEDNESDAY 10:34

103
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,400
- Hi.
- Hey.

104
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,200
Where have you been?

105
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,250
I...

106
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,510
have told Sonja about you.

107
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,850
And we have decided to take a break.

108
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,220
What are your thoughts on that?

109
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,050
Cool.

110
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,170
Yeah?

111
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:41,370
Or, if... If, or... If, if that's making you sad, then of
course that's, of course... I hope that's not my fault then.

112
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,050
Of course I'm not sad!

113
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,340
No...?

114
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,340
No!

115
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:22,970
What... do you think your parents
would say if I became your boyfriend?

116
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:37,310
I... think it would be fine.

117
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,310
Yeah?

118
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,970
Or... My dad would
probably not object to it.

119
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,970
But your mom would?

120
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,970
My mom is nuts.

121
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,310
In what way?

122
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:08,680
She... No, I mean, it's all crazy.

123
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,800
She thinks the world is about to end.

124
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:16,820
That my uncle is Donald
Trump, like, it's...

125
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,650
My uncle is <b>not</b> Donald Trump.

126
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,680
Okay...

127
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,620
But anyway, yeah. She doesn't mean shit, I
haven't talked to her since I moved out.

128
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,680
So you're not in contact anymore?

129
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:44,080
No... Well, I've decided that my life is
better without mentally ill people around me.

130
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:06,080
What do you think your parents,
then, would say about... me?

131
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,800
I think they'd love you.

132
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,800
- I need something to drink.

133
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,260
- Come on, guys, let's go to Kiwi
- Kiwi, yeah, alright.

134
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,900
Did you see Helene today?

135
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,090
Hi. I've now been washing stairs for six hours and am dying
of an OD-day overdose. What have you done today? Nice to

136
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,590
see you yesterday, wanna hang? <i>["OD-day" = a Norwegian
tradition where students volunteer their time for charity]</i>

137
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,880
- Hello, little buddy! Hi!
- Hi.

138
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:39,540
Hey, I've got a little prize for you, for
being so nice and paying your rent on time.

139
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:43,540
- You have a prize for me?
- Yes. Do you want it?

140
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,540
Uhm, yeah!

141
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,620
I'm gonna let you choose a hand.

142
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,620
Uhhhhm, right.

143
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:56,600
- You can choose the left one.
- I'll take the left one, then.

144
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,310
Voilà! For you!

145
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,740
An air purifyer, huh? Funny.

146
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,420
So it's a lavender fragrance that I
thought you could have here in your room.

147
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:15,140
- Yeah, thanks so much.
- In case you get any more...

148
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,680
In case you get any more visits
from that guy... that guy Even.

149
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,710
Or whatever his name was...

150
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:37,340
- Uhm... Eskild?
- Yeah?

151
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,820
I guess I'll say it... Well...

152
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:53,370
There is... In a way, there's a...
a thing, between Even and I.

153
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,220
We... are doing stuff...

154
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,570
You don't say? That's...

155
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,140
Hey, that's awesome, Isak.

156
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:14,540
Hey, that's absolutely fantastic!

157
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,280
You're not surprised?

158
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:24,940
Isak, the first time I met you, you were sitting alone in a
gay bar at 2 in the morning, and you didn't wanna go home.

159
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:30,370
I've told you, I didn't
know it was a gay bar.

160
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:37,280
- But it doesn't mean I'm gay, though.
- No, I mean...

161
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:42,370
That's... That doesn't matter. The most important
thing is that you've found someone you like.

162
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,110
There's nothing wrong with being gay either,
it's just, I'm not like, a gay-gay, though.

163
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:52,400
- Okay, like what?
- Well, like... like you.

164
00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:00,740
Okay... Yeah... And what...
What is it that <b>I'm</b> like?

165
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:11,110
You know what I mean, right? I mean, you talk loudly about
sucking cock, and Kim Kardashian and lavender scent.

166
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:20,820
Well, I absolutely respect that you go all the way on
the gay-thing, but it's just... I'm not like that.

167
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:25,340
Well, there's no "gay-thing" that
I try to go all the way on...

168
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,310
I'm just trying to... I'm just
trying to be myself, Isak.

169
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:32,050
Yeah, man. My God, yeah I get that.

170
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,820
I didn't mean to... Yeah, of course
<b>you</b> are completely yourself.

171
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:45,440
What I mean is that it seems <b>everybody</b> has to
associate being gay with being like <b>that</b>. And...

172
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:52,480
that kinda sucks, for
those who are <b>not</b> like that.

173
00:19:52,770 --> 00:20:00,770
Because, it's not like I'm gonna wear mascara and...
tights and join Gay Pride just because I like Even.

174
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,620
Okay, let me...

175
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:15,420
I need to tell you one thing about those people
who you don't want to be associated with, Isak.

176
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,400
About those who have worn tights and mascara and went
out and fought for the right to be who they are.

177
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:29,200
They're people who, throughout the years, have
chosen to endure harassment... and hate...

178
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,680
who have been beaten up and killed.

179
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:39,110
And that's not because they're so
insanely keen on being different.

180
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,280
But because they'd rather die than
pretend to be something they're not.

181
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:51,600
And that, Isak, requires courage
on a whole other level than...

182
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,510
most human beings understand.
And I...

183
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,850
I think...

184
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:05,250
I think that before you've
fought that battle yourself...

185
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,710
before you've dared to
stand up for who you are...

186
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,000
you should be fucking careful with talking
and raising yourself above Gay Pride.

187
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:25,140
- Yeah, I didn't mean to raise myself above it.
- Yeah. Yeah, Isak... you did.

188
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:34,080
And now...

189
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,680
Right now I don't really want
to talk to you much more.

190
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:46,820
So now... You can sit there and
think about what I've said.

191
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:19,420
[Hi. It was nice to see you too. I don't really know, but maybe things have
happened too quickly.. I know it's my fault, but I need some time, sorry.]

192
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,470
- Oh, yeah, this fucking hot third grader at Nissen!
- We're bros, and you haven't told us?!

193
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,330
- Yeah, what the fuck! Yeah, so what happened
was that we we're at a party at Grünerloøkka.

194
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,740
- Yeah, so what happened?
- And we're just, we haven't done <b>shit</b> the whole party, just going around chilling. She comes, and I'm like "Oh fuck, it's her!"

195
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,660
- So she takes my hand, and drags me into the toilet!
- No!! -In. To. The. Toilet.

196
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,440
 It was a dream? <b>MAGNUS:</b> I was like, pinching myself <b>while</b> I was
hooking up with her. -No! -To check that it wasn't a dream.</b>

197
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,100
- Maaan, so you hooked up with her? - And <b>then</b> what happened? -Yeah,
we hooked up, and she took off her blouse. And I took off my shirt.

198
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,120
Yeah, yeah!
Like...

199
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,700
- No!
- And we hook like crazy, and then like... You finished?

200
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,750
- No, we didn't get to fuck, because there was no toilet seat on that fucking shit toilet.
- Damn...

201
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,990
- So what if there's no toilet seat?
- I tried to sit on it, but I just started to sink, like...

202
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,160
- Take her from behind, man!
- Yeah, oh fuck! I could have done that.

203
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,080
- Fuck.
- He's an amateur, man! -I didn't think about that. But alright. So we hook up...

204
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:31,570
And a bunch of people want into the toilet, and I'm puking in that
fucking poop, shit and piss, and whatever the fuck it's called.

205
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,400
- And that's when you freaked out?
- Yeah, yeah. I freaked out. I had to get out. And we both jumped out the window.

206
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:43,190
- No?! - She went around... -Yeah... -...up on the porch, I went through the door... -Yeah... -...and that was right
by the toilet... and then a guy came and was like: "Hey, damn, someone's fucking in the toilet, what should we do?"

207
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,480
And I was like: "For real...?" Actually me!

208
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:51,320
- That was fucking hilarious!
- But guys, seriously, what's up tonight? -I'm wearing a shirt, man!

209
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,710
- We have to find at least one place.
- You're looking really fucking good tonight. -Thanks, thanks, thanks.

210
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,040
Have to get us in. - Mathias and the Ekeberg guys. -Yeah, so call him
right away, dude! -Call him, man! -Mathias... -What's up? I'm hoping

211
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,860
Yo! Hey! What's up?

212
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,760
Yeah, you guys are going out, right?

213
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,940
You've <b>got</b> a place?

214
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:11,400
- Where?
- Who? Yeah, who? Who's coming?

215
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:16,380
- Who's hosting, who's hosting? -'00 Nissen. -Yeah,
done! You know them. yep! -Yeah, so who's hosting?

216
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,880
- It's at Emma's? Emma?
- Yeah, done!!

217
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,800
Yeah, okay, right!, yo!
But where is it, though?

218
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:28,260
- The address, just in a message.
- Yeah, the address. Yeah. just send a message, okay? Yeah, we are just three people. Okay. right. Bye.

219
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,040
It's at Emma's. Yes! Emma in the first grade.
You can get us the entry, Isak. You know Emma!

220
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,170
- No, she hates me now.

221
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,880
- Huh, why is that?

222
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,180
- Just, what the fuck!
- I have seen you, man, you have mad skills, just talk to her!

223
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:46,420
- Vilde is gonna be there and stuff. Just get us in, Isak!
- No, it's not gonna work. It doesn't fucking matter that I know her, she hates me.

224
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,590
- No, the boy needs to attend a family gathering,
apparantly. Then we'll just go there, the rest of us.

225
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,900
What the fuck...?

226
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:57,820
- That's all there is to it! Alright, just forget...
- I forgive you for forgetting my birthday, alright?

227
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:04,300
- No, it's not gonna work, man! -'00.
- Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma!

228
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,320
Rap a little bit about Emma.

229
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:15,160
Emma... very hot... real nice,
short hair... chillin' the...

230
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:22,960
'00 party Emma G, Isak gets us in,
I-sak, gets us in at Emma, '00.

231
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,160
You're not gonna put on shoes, though?

232
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,200
- Hey guys, what's up?!
- Who are you, man?

233
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,190
- "Who are you?"?
- Who are <b>you</b>? -Whoops. -What are you're doing? -We're gonna party right now.

234
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:21,520
- It's Emma who lives here, right?
- Yeah, are you invited, or what? Yeah. Actually.

235
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,500
- Who are you, then? Are you, like...
- Are you a bouncer?

236
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:28,440
- I'm actually just a friend of Emma's.
- So are we, so it's a great match.

237
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,400
- Which grade are you in?
- We're in second. -Can't you just see if Emma's there, and then confirm that we're invited.

238
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,560
It's alright, I know them.

239
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,940
Emma! Has anyone seem Emma?

240
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,620
Guys, I don't know, it's starting
to get really crowded in here...

241
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:49,020
- This is no day parade!
- It's no day parade! It's a normal house party.

242
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:54,040
- So, just go get Emma.
- There's no stress, man, just get Emma. -Just let me in. -Why would I let <b>you</b> in?

243
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,780
- My name is Isak, I'm in the second grade and I <b>know</b>
Emma, she's in first grade, just let me talk to her.

244
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:03,280
- And her last name is...?
- Her name is Emma Larsen, I know her well, just let me <b>in</b>!

245
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,720
And these guys can stand outside in
the meantime, and I'll be <b>right</b> back.

246
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:12,460
You do get that it's getting <b>fucking</b> full here now, right?
So you've got <b>one</b> minute, and they'll wait here. Alright?

247
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,240
Hey!

248
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,560
What are you doing here?

249
00:27:52,920 --> 00:28:00,920
Hey... It was fucking shitty of us when we bailed on you
on Halloween. I get it if you think I'm an asshole.

250
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,740
It's not because of <b>that</b> that
I think you're an asshole.

251
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:13,860
I think you're an asshole because you allowed me
be interested in you, even though you're gay.

252
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,360
It's 2016, Isak. Go get
yourself out of the closet.

253
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:45,960
- Have you hooked up with anyone today?
- No! -No? -No! -Nobody?

254
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,240
- Why not?
- There was no one at the party I <b>wanted</b> to hook up with.

255
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,460
- There was <b>nobody</b> you
wanted to hook up with? No!

256
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,780
- What's up, man?
- Let's get out of here!

257
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,240
- Huh?!
- He's going to a family gathering, let the guy jet!

258
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,000
- No!
- Wow!

259
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,200
- Do you have to so cheeky? Huh?!! - What's going on?
- Hey, what the fuck, what's going on with you, man?

260
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,180
- What's going on right now?

261
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,180
- What the fuck just happened?

262
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:15,980
- Relax, though, buddy! Yeah, what the <b>fuck</b>!
- I was just kidding, like, what's his deal?
