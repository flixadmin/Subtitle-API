-Very interesting.
-Perhaps we can stick to the agenda.

-There is a form of words here.

-Arrogant bastard.

Some weeks ago, Mr Shelby
carried out a military mission

on behalf of pro-treaty Republicans
here in Birmingham.

-Temporarily, we have a shared interest.
-Oh, I see.

53
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,320
-Shall we just stop him laughing?
-You want me to stop laughing?

54
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,880
Explain this, pal.

55

-We're going to make you do it again.
-Will you shut up?

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,200
Can we just conduct
ourselves here, please?

58

-Conduct ourselves!
-Please.

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,600
-Why him?
-Did you ask why in France?

64
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,880
-Yeah.
-So, it's the same answer, because.

65
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,240
Why me?

66
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,520
-Because.
-Because.

67
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,280
Because if anybody connects me to this,

68
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,840
it will be assumed
that it was a criminal act

69
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,760
and not a political one.

70
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,440
No, you need not fear being
connected to the killing

71
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,880
because I will see to it that
no connection is ever made.

72
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,360
You will have complete
immunity after the fact.

73
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,760
But, in the execution, you will get
no help from agents of the Crown.

74

And we can't be seen to be involved.

No equals bang,

as he looks the other way.

What about your export licence,

Donal Henry, he is a spy.

He is working for the Irregulars
against the pro-treaty Paddies.

86
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,520
He reports every fucking
word back to them.

No, it's not possible.

162
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,520
In a gambling den?

163
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,520
I'll wait in the car.

164
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,080
If I open the door again,
they'll all want to come in.

165
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,200
Like flies.

166
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,000
So what are you?

167
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,800
(STAMMERING) What am I?

168
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,360
To Thomas?

169
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,440
I'm going to train his racehorse...
For Epsom.

170
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,000
You know horses?

171
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,880
Yes. You?

172
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,240
Born riding.

173
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,400
I slept in a manger when I was a baby.

174
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,880
I was born riding, too.

175
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,160
(DOOR OPENS)

176
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,280
JOHN: There's a fucking
great Riley parked out there

177
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,640
and nobody's watching it.

178
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,800
John, this woman says
she's training Thomas' horse.

179
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,960
He's told us a lot about you.

180
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,640
Don't know where he is, do you?

181
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,680
(DOOR OPENS)

182
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,160
Sorry I'm late.
There was a family matter.

183
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,040
Esme, keep it locked up for a minute.

184
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,760
-Yes, Thomas.
-I'll show you around.

185
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,920
So, be my guest.

186
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,200
That's my brother Arthur's office.

187
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,720
Down there is my brother John's office,

188
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,400
that's where we slate
the runners and the riders.

189
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,360
It's so out in the open.
What about the police?

190
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,160
What about them?

191
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,440
When I drove into Small Heath,
I thought I was going to get murdered...

192
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,680
Then I mentioned your name.

193
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,320
It was like being escorted
to see a king.

194
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,360
-You came here to get my girl, right?
-Right.

195
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,520
She looks in very good condition,

196
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,920
considering she's not been
out on the gallops.

197
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,000
Curly's the best horseman in England.

198
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,640
I have a man called Mickey
who'd argue the point.

199
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,200
Ah, Curly here is half horse himself.

200
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,440
She's blessed. Very blessed.

201
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,400
Well, she's from the best stock.

202
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,920
But I'd rather have a coloured pony.
Mixed blood is stronger.

203
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,200
Not to win the Derby, Curly.

204
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,320
Don't like them racing, Tommy,
not the way they beat them.

205
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,520
-She's all yours.
-Thank you.

206
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,840
TOMMY: He gets sad when one leaves.

207
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,840
-What time is your box van coming?
-Midday.

208
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,800
Maybe you've got time to take
the lady to the Garrison,

209
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,680
show her the spa and the tearooms.

210
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,000
I'd like that, why not?

211
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,040
TOMMY: I just had it done up.
There was a fire.

212
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,640
It's...

213
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,160
Yeah.

214
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,720
What do you drink?

215
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,720
So early, but gin.

216
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,120
Goodness. With something?

217
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,520
Like what?

218
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,480
Tonic water or...

219
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,560
Erm... We have, erm...

220
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,000
Cordial.

221
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,080
There's not much room in there but...

222
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,400
You want to fuck me, Mrs Car let on?

223
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,880
Perhaps because I...

224
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,080
Perhaps because I would represent
something to you?

225
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,480
We should have this conversation
before the booze

226
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,000
starts talking for us.

227
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,560
You have a horse.

228
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,600
Yes, I have a horse.

229
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,720
The horse is why I'm here.

230
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,400
Purely that.

231
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,200
And because you're paying me a
lot of money to train your horse,

232
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,760
that's why I'm here.

233
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,640
Purely that.

234
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,280
Good.

235
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,160
Good. Well, a toast, then.

236
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,840
To the horse, to the Derby.

237
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,800
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

238
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,040
So is that what you say to women?

239
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,920
Only if I don't know what they want.

240
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,760
And what if they don't want to fuck?

241
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,320
Then life is simpler.

242
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,960
You want a simple life?

243
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,760
Do I look like a man
who wants a simple life, eh?

244
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,560
So what do you want?

245
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,720
For what I'm paying you, Mrs Car let on,

246
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,840
I want a horse that'll pay out
at Epsom on an each-way bet.

247
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,680
Before I took your account,

248
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,640
I did some credit checks on you.

249
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,360
Apparently, you don't exist.

250
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,840
My existence is questionable.

251
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,440
Gypsies don't like registers.

252
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,720
You see, I'm not gypsy like you mean.

253
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,720
But you did register for France.

254
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,680
I also sent your name to the War Office,

255
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,520
I have friends there.

256
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,840
You won two medals for gallantry.

257
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,320
Does that really impress you,
Mrs Car let on?

258
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,200
Call me May.

259
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,120
Charlie says the box van's here.

260
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,880
Thank you, Finn.

261
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,200
You know, I still don't know what
you're going to call your horse.

262
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,280
The horse will be called Grace's Secret.

263
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,560
Grace's Secret.

264
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,600
I told him he definitely
can't take the job.

265
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,760
He said, "All right,
I'll move to London, then."

266
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,680
I said, "I won't give in to blackmail.
No is no."

267
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,400
Well... That settles it, then.

268
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,280
I'll give the job
to the other candidate.

269
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,320
He's much better qualified anyway.

270
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,160
Michael did City and Guilds, six months.

271
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,400
Yeah, but he doesn't know racing, Poll.

272
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,400
He knows horses,
but he doesn't know racing.

273
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,960
This other boy, he knows racing.

274
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,920
He's good. He's a fast learner.

275
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,360
What if Michael really leaves?

276
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,880
You just got to let him go, Poll.

277
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,600
He'll get a job in an office in London.

278
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,160
I'm sure he'll write to you.

279
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,720
He made a big speech

280
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:53,160
about wanting to help you
build up a respectable business.

281
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,000
Oh, he's like his dad,
he could make me cry.

282
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,040
There are trains to London.

283
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,880
So I just let him leave?

284
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,280
Every month or so he'd be back.

285
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,520
Unless, of course, he meets a girl.

286
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,720
Then, who knows?

287
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,880
Oh, my God.

288
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,000
You want him to do this job.

289
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,080
Polly, I want what you want.

290
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,160
What about this other more
qualified candidate?

291
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,000
Mmm...

292
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,680
Well, I lied, there isn't one.

293
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,240
How much you paying?

294
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,880
-The advertised rate.
-Like hell.

295
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,640
-Three bob.
-Like hell.

296
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,440
-Three and six.
-Four.

297
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,360
Four it is.

298
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,880
-I love him, Tom.
-I know.

299
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,640
That's why I'll keep him away
from the old business,

300
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,120
put him charge of the new. Agreed?

301
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,840
Agreed.

302
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,920
Well, Finn, you've got two choices,
mild or mild.

303
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,080
-Mild.
-There you go.

304
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,680
-(DOOR OPENS)
-Here he is, look.

305
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,720
(CHEERING)

306
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,400
Happy birthday, Michael.

307
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,400
Eighteen years old. You're a man today.

308
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,760
Give him a drink, John boy.

309
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,160
-There you go, lad.
-And after that,

310
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,680
we'll go to find you
a lady of the night.

311
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,960
Arthur!

312
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,760
TOMMY: Michael. (CLEARS THROAT)

313
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,440
What's that?

314
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,720
TOMMY: So you're never late for work.

315
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,400
ARTHUR: Welcome to the business,
Michael.

316
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,720
-Welcome to the business.
-Thank you.

317
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,880
Right, come on, let's get him drunk.
Come here, you.

318
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,160
All right, whisky.

319
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,320
No whisky, he's at work tomorrow.
Give him only dark mild.

320
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,440
A toast.

321
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,280
-ARTHUR: Toast.
-To Michael.

322
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,960
ALL: To Michael.

323
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,840
(DOOR OPENS)

324
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,840
You all right?

325
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,880
-What is it? Just us?
-Just us.

326
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,280
POLLY: We celebrating?

327
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,200
TOMMY: Just taste this.

328
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,760
What do you think, Arthur?

329
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,400
Yeah, it's good.
Good stuff, really nice.

330
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,400
Too good for the Garrison.

331
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,840
I suppose we could shift it
to the toffs at the Eden Club.

332
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,000
Why? What is it?

333
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,280
That is part of an export drive.

334
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,760
We now have a secure warehouse
in Camden Town

335
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,760
and secure passage to the Poplar Docks.

336
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,680
So, on Monday morning,

337
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,520
we'll be sending out
our first export crates.

338
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,240
A crate of Riley car spares,

339
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,400
bound for Halifax, Nova Scotia.

340
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,800
Where there's prohibition.

341
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,880
Where there is prohibition.

342
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,000
All over Canada and America,

343
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,040
people are making their own booze
in bathtubs.

344
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,360
But rich people in New York,
in Toronto and Boston

345
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,600
are still paying a lot of
money for the real stuff.

346
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,960
So, on Monday,
the first Shelby company crates

347
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,160
will contain a thousand
Riley carburettors.

348
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,840
But hidden in the packing
will be 500 bottles

349
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,120
of the finest quality
single malt Scotch whisky.

350
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,320
And we Shelbys, have a licence

351
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,480
granted by the
Minister Of The Empire himself,

352
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,760
which means our crates
won't be searched.

353
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,800
And, Polly, all of the whisky
will be packed at the docks,

354
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,200
so Michael can do the books
without being involved.

355
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,360
Like I've been telling
you all for a year now,

356
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,760
motor cars are the future.

357
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,600
So, how is your life then, Tom?

358
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,320
On the up, Johnny, on the up.

359
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,880
But, Tom, really, come on, how is it?

360
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,040
You know I hate to
see you not even married yet.

361
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,680
I have a fine looking cousin,
she'll make your life hell.

362
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,000
You deserve her!

363
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,080
(CHUCKLING)

364
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,480
We haven't had a good old
wedding in a long time.

365
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,960
Rather look inside these boxes,
then, Johnny?

366
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,600
What do I want to look
at car parts, Tommy,

367
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,120
when I haven't even got a car?

368
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,040
Faith in family's a fine thing, eh?

369
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,200
And I wouldn't even be counting.

370
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,920
Twenty-five becomes 24, then 24 it is.

371
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,840
Oh, you know I'm no good
with numbers, Tom.

372
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,920
And if 24 ever became 23,

373
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,680
then that'd be tax.

374
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,120
We don't pay tax.

375
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,440
No, Tom.

376
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,720
Good man.

377
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,120
KITCHEN: I put an iron door on,

378
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,080
and we've put iron bars on the
windows and across the skylights.

379
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,480
TOMMY: Good.

380
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,040
So what will you
be keeping in here, Tommy?

381
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,680
Temptation, Billy. Temptation.

382
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,600
(DOOR OPENS)

383
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,760
Morning, Arthur. I was just passing.

384
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,200
ARTHUR: I think I'm in fucking love.

385
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,560
Drink!

386
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,760
She don't know where to look.

387
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,520
Whisky, Tommy?

388
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,400
No, I've got a long drive ahead.

389
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,920
You off home?

390
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,360
Mmm-hmm. Eventually.

391
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,080
To Birmingham.

392
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,000
What's this?

393
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,320
Olives.

394
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,000
Yes, it's miscellaneous.

395
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,240
It's, erm, olives.

396
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,520
Sticks, you know, with little bits
of fucking onion and things.

397
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,000
That's what that is.

398
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,200
We've taken 600 pounds on olives.

399
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,120
Yeah, with little bits of onion.

400
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,440
I told you, Arthur...

401
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,800
The dealers sell the cocaine,
we take a cut.

402
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,000
We don't sell direct.

403
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,080
The Home Secretary's cracking down

404
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,000
and I don't want this,

405
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,680
to fuck up everything else,
you understand?

406
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,920
I understand.

407
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,520
How much of that 600
came out of your pocket?

408
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,880
It's under control.

409
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,760
I put you down here cos people
are scared of you, Arthur.

410
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,000
But if you don't straighten up,
it'll be John's turn in London.

411
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,280
No need.

412
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,680
I can handle it.

413
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,720
It's under control?

414
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,320
It's under control.

415
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,240
Fucking tidy profit, though, eh?

416
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,640
It's happening, Tom.

417
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,920
Good.

418
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,080
Good.

419
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,120
TOMMY: Straighten up, soldier.

420
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,760
Yes, sir, Sergeant Major.

421
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,240
What's your business?

422
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,080
Sorry, I'm, er, I'm lost here.

423
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,000
Yeah, well, you can't stop here.

424
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,880
-Move on.
-All right.

425
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,640
(ENGINE STARTS)

426
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,520
Twenty-three seconds.

427
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,240
It's all right, Ada,
it'll be Andrew for me.

428
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,320
Oh.

429
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,120
I'm looking for Ada.

430
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,560
Who are you?

431
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,680
Ada.

432
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,440
I asked you a question.

433
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,240
It's all right, James.

434
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,560
This is my brother.

435
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,960
Who's he?

436
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,360
He rents a room.

437
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,200
You need to rent out rooms?

438
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,080
Actually, she doesn't charge rent.

439
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,640
He's a writer, which means he's skint.

440
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,120
You get up late these days, Ada.

441
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,920
Mmm. I go to bed late.

442
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,520
TOMMY: Yeah? Where's Karl?

443
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,560
What do you want, Tommy?

444
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,680
Oh, God, before you start
sizing him up for a wedding suit,

445
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,400
he's not interested in me.

446
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,760
-Or in girls of any kind.
-Ada!

447
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,280
What? Tommy won't judge you.

448
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,080
He sure as hell won't go to the police.

449
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,160
Look, I'll go and get dressed.

450
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,920
James...

451
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,680
I'm Thomas.

452
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,440
Pleased to meet you.

453
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,400
Can I have a minute
with my sister, please?

454
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,400
Yes, of course.

455
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,280
So, does your lodger know your name?

456
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,040
Yeah. Thorne.

457
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,400
You think I'd tell anybody
anything else?

458
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,240
Your Brummie boys
are all over the papers.

459
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,440
Just one last push, eh?
Then you'll go legit?

460
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,280
Just one more obstacle to get round,
then it'll all be straight?

461
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,880
Actually, yes.

462
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,120
(GIGGLING)

463
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,480
Personally, I find it quite amusing.

464
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,200
Men like you are becoming
very fashionable down here.

465
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,920
No society party in London
is complete without a gangster

466
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,720
for the girls to go giddy for.

467
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,680
Anyway, what is it that you want?

468
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,600
I don't have any children, Ada,

469
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,880
so I have set up a trust fund.

470
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,680
The beneficiaries
will be John's kids and Karl.

471
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,960
In order for Karl to benefit,
I need your signature.

472
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,440
I've set up an account.

473
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,640
The money will be transferred
in the event of my death.

474
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,000
It'll set them up for a new life.

475
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,000
Are you sick?

476
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,760
I'm just doing
what any ordinary man would,

477
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,320
putting my affairs in order.

478
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,680
DARBY: <i>Did you know they was
going to take the Eden club?</i>

479
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,480
ALFIE: I know about the Eden club, yes.

480
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,600
Did you know they were going
to do it before they did it?

481
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,400
Because that's someone
who's in charge, isn't it?

482
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,080
The one who knows before it happens.

483
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,640
I know what I know, you know.

484
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,920
If you don't know,
then you don't fucking know, do you?

485
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,440
Did you know they was going
to take Wimbledon Docks?

486
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,480
Harringay? The trotting tracks?

487
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,160
Talk, all right?
I genuinely want to hear you.

488
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,560
You've lost control, Alfie.

489
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,960
ALFIE: Have I?

490
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,480
MAN: Everybody knows.

491
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,720
-Talk to me, Alfie.
-Talk to you?

492
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,480
All right, I'll talk to you.
I'll fucking tell you how it was, right?

493
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,520
What happened was this.

494
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,120
All the time you were talking about
dirty fucking Jews.

495
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,440
All the fucking time,

496
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,840
dirty fucking Jews, dirty Kikes,
dirty dustbin lids...

497
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,360
-Everyone makes jokes.
-You want to talk about

498
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,680
-not getting into places?
-Everybody makes fucking jokes.

499
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,120
I didn't know you had
no sense of humour!

500
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,640
And I ain't going
to fucking mention, right,

501
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,040
the great big fuck off elephant
in the room.

502
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,920
Look, Alfie...

503
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,720
How many of my bookies
worked Epsom this last May?

504
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,520
None. None.

505
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,400
Not one.

506
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,320
So, for a few fucking jokes and Epsom,

507
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,880
you fucking invite
a tribe of savages into the city

508
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,920
and just fucking
unlock the fucking gates!

509
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,000
I'm sorry, what are you saying, mate?

510
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,080
I'm saying...

511
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,960
I'm sorry about the Jew thing.

512
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,560
-You saying you're sorry?
-Yeah.

513
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,360
-You're sorry about the Jew thing?
-Yeah.

514
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,840
-Really?
-Yeah.

515
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,440
I want that in writing.
Write that down. He said, "I'm sorry".

516
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,480
And also write down

517
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,320
that all our bookies
can go back to Epsom.

518
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,080
-He didn't say that.
-Who's asking you?

519
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,160
Eh.

520
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,320
Write it down.

521
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,760
It's all right. Come on.

522
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,320
Alfie's an old friend.

523
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,280
My friend.

524
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,240
Now, admit it,

525
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,360
the Peaky Blinders is out of control.

526
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,760
Yeah, they're out
of fucking control, mate.

527
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,160
They come down the canal,
they spread like the fucking clap.

528
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,400
Right. So now they're

529
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,080
-everybody's problem.
-Yeah.

530
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,440
-Alfie.
-Mmm.

531
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,720
You and me, we've been fighting

532
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,480
-since we was at school.
-Yeah.

533
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,760
All right? Now, also,

534
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,880
-we've been friends.
-Mmm, yeah.

535
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,880
You know,
it goes backwards and forwards.

536
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,480
How much better is it
when we're friends?

537
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,560
Oh, it's much better, mate, yeah.

538
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,240
You write that down.

539
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,840
Mmm.

540
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,160
So what we're doing here, right,

541
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,880
is we're writing down some
kind of a deal thing, right?

542
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,560
-Yeah, a written deal.
-Written deal, good.

543
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:26,840
Well, why don't we discuss
the border between the Italians

544
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,960
and the Jews going back
to Farringdon Road.

545
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,520
-Farringdon Road...
-Yeah, Farringdon Road.

546
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,520
Fuck! That's ancient history.

547
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,440
-Write down Farringdon Road.
-No, no, no, write down Camden Road.

548
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,200
-Farringdon Road.
-Camden Road.

549
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,360
-Write down Farringdon.
-Camden.

550
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,560
-Farringdon.
-Camden.

551
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,400
Write down Camden Road.

552
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,320
Just write down "peace".

553
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,440
Just write down "peace", right,

554
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,840
between the Jews and the Italians.

555
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,120
And war against the gypsies.

556
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,600
Fuck.

00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,880
Nice house.

560
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,480
Would you like a whisky?

561
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,600
Scotch or Irish?

562
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,720
Irish.

(GLASSES CLINKING)

564
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,440
Sorry for the short notice.

565
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,600
I was passing.

566
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,640
We're not quite on the Birmingham road.

567
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,880
It was a small diversion.

568
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,480
Sixty miles, I checked.

569
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,480
That's a small diversion these days.

570
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,840
So, I'm a small diversion.

571
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,160
Good.

572
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,800
Your horse is still out on the gallops,

573
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,680
but I had Mickey prepare this report.

574
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,720
You can read it now if you'd like,
then we can go see her.

575
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,920
-(CLEARS THROAT)
-ls there enough light for you to read?

576
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,280
Yes, it's fine.

577
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,320
It's getting quite late.

578
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,120
Mickey says she has
the lungs of an elephant.

579
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,600
She's nimble in the heavy going,

580
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,960
but bounces a little on the hard ground.

581
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,200
Sorry, I'll let you read.

582
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,960
So, he thinks she'll favour
good to soft ground, eh?

583
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,600
-A little juice in the grass.
-Mmm.

584
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,360
Well, that's good for Epsom.

585
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,040
Does he think she's
not good enough for Epsom?

586
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,840
She needs a lot of work.

587
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,320
The race board will need convincing.

588
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,320
-I imagine you have some influence.
-Mmm.

589
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,360
That's the suggested program me
for the next two months.

590
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,800
Your glass is empty.

591
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,760
It's fine.

592
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,560
Are you hungry?

593
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,600
Yes, a bit.

594
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,720
I can prepare something.

595
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,480
Do you have engine oil?

596
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,040
Before I set off for Birmingham,
the car needs oil.

597
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,920
I'm sure my husband
kept some in the garage.

598
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,400
I can get someone to do it.

599
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,240
This evening or tomorrow?

600
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,000
Well, we're so far from anywhere,
people usually stay over.

601
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,440
Especially before cars,
when it was just carriages,

602
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,160
people used to stay over all the time.

603
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,280
But I have a car.

604
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,760
Yes.

605
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,160
And you have engine oil.

606
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,600
Probably.

607
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,680
But it would be very usual.

608
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,400
What would?

609
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,200
For a guest to stay.

610
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,040
We have a whole wing
called the guest wing.

611
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,080
Oh, you...

612
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,960
You have a guest wing.

613
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,560
Well...

Ignore this. It's actually all right.

619
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,560
I put all his photos
in a drawer and locked it...

620
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,920
As if that was going
to make a difference.

621
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,600
I'm like a fucking lighthouse keeper...

622
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,360
Out here on my own...

623
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,720
Keeping his flame burning.

624
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,480
But, of course,
when anyone sees a lighthouse

625
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,640
they steer clear, don't they?

626
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,920
Now, do you have a map?

627
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,600
Of the house. Do you have a map?

628
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:23,200
Because I'm not going to be able
to find my way in the dark.

629
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,480
You see, at midnight,

630
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,400
I'm going to leave my wing

631
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,600
and I'm going to come find you.

632
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,440
And I'm going to turn the handle
of your bedroom door

633
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,480
without making a sound

634

You don't know maids.

They hear a pin drop?

637
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,080
If there's a man in the house,
they listen.

638
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,600
They take turns.

639

They go out on their own

Mickey, they go out in twos and
threes and buy their own drinks.

The Marquis,
that's where the BSA secretaries go.

655
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:02,480
Look, they won't serve a black man
without a Shelby by his side.

656
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,120
So you're using me?

657
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,480
Yeah.

I don't drink in pubs with blacks.

672
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,960
So leave.

673
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,400
Look, my dad is the preacher round here.

674
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,400
He has connections, ask anybody.

675
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,720
I couldn't give a fuck who he is.

676
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,040
I'm telling you to leave it, Paddy.

677
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,720
And I'm telling this darkie
to get out of here.

leave it.

He's Polly Shelby's son!

Get out!

689
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,080
Get out the fucking pub.

690
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,920
I clearly didn't know.

691
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,240
Fuck, let's go. Let's go!

692
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,320
We ordered some drinks

693
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,360
and we're going to drink them.

694

Did you see his fucking face?

You punch like a fucking kangaroo.

you punch like that.

Yeah, from you.

You can get a whisky,
maybe even a dark mild.

it's packed in here, isn't it?

703

Easy as that, John boy.
London, you wouldn't believe it.

704
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,760
Finn, stick your head in a bucket.

No.

I've got this one,
she's a dancer, right?

She can do things with her...

If Finn would just piss off,
I'd explain a little bit better.

710
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,760
Well, if it's so good, why are you here?

711
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,440
Decent pints.

The cockneys can't get that right.

from drinking, but it's all right.

We fought them off.

Arthur, we had to stand
our ground and we did.

-Preaching.
-Right.

-Where are you going?
-ARTHUR: We won't be long.

We didn't do it for you, Michael.

We did it for the good name
of the company.

None of this happened, all right?

No. That would arouse suspicion.
