1
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,229
That's it!

2
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,194
Did you feel it?

3
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,754
Texas!

4
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,112
I've made this trip three times...

5
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,075
...and every time
there's three big bumps...

6
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,798
...and that's how you know!

7
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,269
We are officially in Texas!

8
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,230
This time I got a job waiting for me.

9
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,353
I got a cousin who's got a body shop.

10
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,913
Yo, that's for me, homes!

11
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,829
They call me "Olive Oil" because
I paint them slick.

12
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:41,478
I do pearlescent, colour-shift,
you name it.

13
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,077
I painted cars for some of...

14
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,515
...the biggest gangsters in Michoacán.

15
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,673
Wow, those are beautiful boots!

16
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,915
Not much good for working, but...

17
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,392
Hey, what's on the toes there?
Little silver...
