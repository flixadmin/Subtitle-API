31
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:40,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From a little blue menace
on the planet called Earth.</font>

32
00:05:42,716 --> 00:05:44,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd be happy to show you the way.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry. Nobody's gonna get hurt.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are those?
- Bombs. Bombs.</font>

47

<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're bombs! Those are bombs!</font>

48
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:51,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax. They're not even lit.</font>

51
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why aren't you slowing down?</font>

52
00:08:01,855 --> 00:08:03,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That would require brakes.</font>

53
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's hot. Hot, hot, hot!</font>

54
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:10,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you just let
the police handle this?</font>

55
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because that's not what heroes do.</font>

56
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you very much.
Please hold your applause.</font>

57
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you hear that? There's one bomb left.</font>

58
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:28,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-oh.</font>

59
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:31,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you check under the seat?
- Of course I checked under the seat!</font>

60
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:34,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are terrible at this!</font>

61
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:37,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what? Your negative attitude
is not helping anyone.</font>

62
00:08:38,642 --> 00:08:40,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's in your spiky things!</font>

63
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can never find anything in here.</font>

64
00:08:45,607 --> 00:08:47,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drained it from downtown!</font>

65
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See? I told you nobody would get hurt.</font>

66
00:08:53,907 --> 00:08:55,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy sherbet!</font>

67
00:08:57,786 --> 00:08:58,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, hello.</font>

68
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't panic. This is only a drill.</font>

69
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come here!
- No need to thank me, citizens.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a terrible hero!</font>

73
00:10:07,314 --> 00:10:09,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Morning, Wade!
- Morning, Sonic!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good morning, Green Hills!</font>

75
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

76
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-oh.</font>

77
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic.</font>

78
00:11:04,204 --> 00:11:05,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I miss you, Longclaw.</font>

79
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying to make you proud.</font>

80
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now for a little shut-eye.</font>

81
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:27,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ozzy, morning breath!</font>

82
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic. Are you still in bed?</font>

83
00:11:30,105 --> 00:11:31,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're supposed to meet Tom, remember?</font>

84
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:37,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, all right, I'm up! I'm up.</font>

85
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:40,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a day.</font>

86
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks for coming out, bud.</font>

87
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel like you and me,
we haven't had much time together lately.</font>

88
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's it going over there?
You getting any bites?</font>

89
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:02,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't swim! Help!</font>

90
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I die, don't look in my closet!</font>

91
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey, you're good.
You're all right. Come on.</font>

92
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's freezing.
- All right, okay. Take it easy.</font>

93
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:14,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're good. Okay.</font>

94
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now that you've had a nap and a bath...</font>

95
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:25,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I went up to your room last night
to bring you some new comics and...</font>

96
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:31,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop right there.</font>

97
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't come any closer,</font>

98
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:36,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because this little hedgehog
had way too many chili dogs.</font>

99
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no. Oh, no.</font>

100
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so embarrassed. Get out of here quick!</font>

101
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, here comes another one!</font>

102
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go. Now. Save yourself.</font>

103
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop right there.</font>

104
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't come any closer,</font>

105
00:12:47,557 --> 00:12:50,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because this little hedgehog
had way too many chili dogs.</font>

106
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no. Oh, no.</font>

107
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:54,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so embarrassed. Get out of here--</font>

108
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew I should've used real farts.</font>

109
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How many times are we gonna do this?
- What?</font>

110
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:03,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cast your line and not catch anything?
Seems like a billion.</font>

111
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you know what I'm talking about.</font>

112
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:08,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The lying. The sneaking out.</font>

113
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The pretending to be Batman.</font>

114
00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:13,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Blue Justice, trademark pending.
- Whatever. You're being reckless.</font>

115
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:15,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not this conversation again.</font>

116
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. It's no fun for me, either.</font>

117
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:20,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if you keep being irresponsible,
we're gonna keep having this conversation.</font>

118
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is it irresponsible to use my powers?</font>

119
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:25,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic, you destroyed an entire city block!</font>

120
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:28,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That block was already messed up.
Who cares?</font>

121
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I stopped a robbery. I was a hero.</font>

122
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:35,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you put people in danger
and that's not what a hero does.</font>

123
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're supposed to be my friend.</font>

124
00:13:40,777 --> 00:13:42,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop trying to be my dad.</font>

125
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can take care of myself.</font>

126
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:53,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic, taking care of yourself
is not what being a hero's all about.</font>

127
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's about taking responsibility
for other people.</font>

128
00:13:57,252 --> 00:14:00,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And right now, whether you want to hear
this or not, you are still just a kid.</font>

129
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:04,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got some more growing up to do
before you're ready to be the big hero.</font>

130
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But trust me when I tell you,</font>

131
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:09,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there will come a time
when your powers will be needed.</font>

132
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you don't choose that moment.</font>

133
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That moment chooses you.</font>

134
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at you.</font>

135
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at that. I just got goose bumps.</font>

136
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:23,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a second.
Did you steal that from Oprah?</font>

137
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, sir.
That is a Wachowski family special.</font>

138
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Came from my dad,
in this very boat, on this very lake.</font>

139
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He would always try and steer me
in the right direction.</font>

140
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:37,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that's what Maddie and I
have always tried to do with you.</font>

141
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:42,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, until your moment arrives,</font>

142
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to work on
being a little more responsible.</font>

143
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Comprende?</font>

144
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Comprende.</font>

145
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">High five on it.</font>

146
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah! Donut Lord and the Blue Blur
are back at it again!</font>

147
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:57,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on.</font>

148
00:14:58,438 --> 00:14:59,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speedboat!</font>

149
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic!</font>

150
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How excited are you,
going to Hawaii with me?</font>

151
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:12,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah!</font>

152
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:14,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

153
00:15:15,705 --> 00:15:18,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to Sonic Air,
the fastest way to travel.</font>

154
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:20,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now boarding groups one and two.</font>

155
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic, this is so fun!</font>

156
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:27,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, ma'am, you're group three.
Please wait your turn.</font>

157
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:31,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Anyone from groups one and two? Nobody?
- Just let him get it out of his system.</font>

158
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, then everybody else right this way.</font>

159
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:35,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

160
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you, sir?</font>

161
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:44,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Terrible shirt detected.</font>

162
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:45,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There we go.</font>

163
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:49,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, you're free to go. Enjoy your trip.
Bye-bye now.</font>

164
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

165
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring it in.</font>

166
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:56,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tom, I'm about to be
hedgehog of the house for the first time.</font>

167
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I'm a little mature
to hug you goodbye.</font>

168
00:15:58,665 --> 00:16:00,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, what about a power bump?</font>

169
00:16:01,084 --> 00:16:02,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Power bump?
- Yes, power bump.</font>

170
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:04,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's more like it.</font>

171
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:06,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wachowski!
- Wachowski!</font>

172
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, use this one to get back home.</font>

173
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:13,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, we're off. Be good.</font>

174
00:16:13,221 --> 00:16:15,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. You have our number.</font>

175
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry! Can't hear you! You're traveling
through a cross-dimensional portal!</font>

176
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Miss you already!
- Okay?</font>

177
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have fun at Rachel's wedding!</font>

178
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:25,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, it's 48 hours until they come back.</font>

179
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:29,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've got TV channels, streaming channels,
a house full of food and no supervision.</font>

180
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's do this.</font>

181
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:02,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If these readings are accurate, he's here.</font>

182
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found him!</font>

183
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just hope I'm not too late.</font>

184
00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:25,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's close.</font>

185
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just need a way to reach him
without being spotted.</font>

186
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Standard human transport. Perfect.</font>

187
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, boy.</font>

188
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aloha!</font>

189
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How's it going, bud?
- Oh, you know.</font>

190
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a quiet night at home,
settling in with a good book.</font>

191
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And you? What's up with you?
- I was just calling to say we're here.</font>

192
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now every word out of your mouth
ls making me suspicious.</font>

193
00:19:03,516 --> 00:19:04,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

194
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:08,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got to relax, buddy.
You're at the Four Seasons Oahu.</font>

195
00:19:08,855 --> 00:19:11,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have a mai tai.
Enjoy some time with your wife.</font>

196
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get sunburned somewhere embarrassing.</font>

197
00:19:13,276 --> 00:19:15,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This weekend is about you.</font>

198
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what? You're right.
We power-bumped on it.</font>

199
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So whatever it is you're doing,</font>

200
00:19:19,949 --> 00:19:22,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure you can undo it
by the time we get home, yeah?</font>

201
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:27,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly! I mean, I am deeply offended
by such accusations!</font>

202
00:19:27,248 --> 00:19:28,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, how's Rachel's fiancée?</font>

203
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ls he as good-looking in person
as he is in pictures?</font>

204
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somehow better-looking.</font>

205
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow! You're about to be
the third best-looking dude in the family.</font>

206
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, hey, still on the podium.</font>

207
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right,
I better go and introduce myself.</font>

208
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay out of trouble.</font>

209
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:50,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trouble? Don't worry.
Everything here is completely normal.</font>

210
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-huh. Night, bud.</font>

211
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! I was just coming over to say hi.</font>

212
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:57,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got a lot of nerve coming up
in here after what you did to my fiancée.</font>

213
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wait. What?
- Totaling her car?</font>

214
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:04,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leaving her tied to a chair?
I should rip you limb from limb.</font>

215
00:20:08,456 --> 00:20:10,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, look at your face!</font>

216
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tommy, breathe, baby. Breathe.
I was kidding.</font>

217
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:14,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, man, I was totally kidding.
- Okay.</font>

218
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You were kidding.
- Yeah.</font>

219
00:20:17,924 --> 00:20:20,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. Rachel put me up to it.
It was totally her idea.</font>

220
00:20:21,302 --> 00:20:22,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That rascal.</font>

221
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, I don't know if you're aware.
Rachel does not care for you at all.</font>

222
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:28,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm aware. Yeah.</font>

223
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously, bro, you got work to do.</font>

224
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:33,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey!
- Hey.</font>

225
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:35,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good to see you! Thanks for coming, Tom.</font>

226
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Really glad you came.
- Really?</font>

227
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great to see you, too. Congratulations.</font>

228
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:44,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, you guys seem
really happy together.</font>

229
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:45,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, you're all right,
Thomas Wachowski.</font>

230
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:50,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can we bury the hatchet?
- I'd love that.</font>

231
00:20:50,331 --> 00:20:51,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah?
- Yeah.</font>

232
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All right, bring it in!
- All right! Great.</font>

233
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you screw up my wedding,
I will end you.</font>

234
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Ozzy,
it's movie night at Casa de Sonic,</font>

235
00:21:04,804 --> 00:21:06,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it's your turn to pick.</font>

236
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I am not watching Snow Dogs again.</font>

237
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That movie is the worst!</font>

238
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blackout!</font>

239
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:19,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ozzy.</font>

240
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, buddy. Everything's okay.</font>

241
00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:31,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me. We did not order a poltergeist.</font>

242
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:45,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If this is the pizza guy,
this is really unprofessional.</font>

243
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:04,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eggman?</font>

244
00:22:08,117 --> 00:22:11,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, hedgehog.</font>

245
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you miss me?</font>

246
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:19,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know how you got back,
but you made a big mistake coming here.</font>

247
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Au conftraire, mon frere.</font>

248
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The mistake was thinking you'd won.</font>

249
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that was just a prelude,
an hors d'oeuvre,</font>

250
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">an aperitif, an amuse-bouche.</font>

251
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:31,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get it.</font>

252
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think you do.</font>

253
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you're about to.</font>

254
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And so will that idiot sheriff
and his wife.</font>

255
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And your little dog too!</font>

256
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pitiful.</font>

257
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:06,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Who are you?</font>

258
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are my manners?</font>

259
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:14,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic, meet Knuckles.</font>

260
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:16,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My new BFFAE.</font>

261
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:20,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bestest friend forever and ever!</font>

262
00:23:20,523 --> 00:23:23,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, Robotnik, I don't care
who you brought to help you.</font>

263
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're never going to get my power.</font>

264
00:23:25,653 --> 00:23:28,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I look like I need your power?</font>

265
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:43,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So nice when diabolical evil
lives up to the hype.</font>

266
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is it?</font>

267
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:50,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want it? Here it comes.</font>

268
00:23:50,553 --> 00:23:55,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was expecting more of you.
You're unskilled.</font>

269
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Untrained.</font>

270
00:23:58,853 --> 00:24:01,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And unworthy!</font>

271
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:06,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You forgot one. Unstoppable.</font>

272
00:24:32,136 --> 00:24:35,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is my destiny
to do what my ancestors could not--</font>

273
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:40,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To restore the ultimate power
to the home of my people.</font>

274
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ultimate power?
I don't know what you're talking about.</font>

275
00:24:44,857 --> 00:24:46,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got the wrong guy.</font>

276
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ultimate power?</font>

277
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now you're speaking my language.</font>

278
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:54,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't play dumb with me,
apprentice of Longclaw.</font>

279
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You knew Longclaw?</font>

280
00:24:56,494 --> 00:25:00,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Longclaw and her people were
the sworn enemy of my tribe, the Echidna.</font>

281
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:05,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We fought and died at their hands,
and now you will die at mine.</font>

282
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Get in! I'm on your side.</font>

283
00:25:18,641 --> 00:25:20,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. Who are you?</font>

284
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what? It doesn't matter.</font>

285
00:25:26,065 --> 00:25:28,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get us out of here! Go, go, go!</font>

286
00:25:32,321 --> 00:25:33,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's gone rabid!</font>

287
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gross! Is he licking it?</font>

288
00:25:38,202 --> 00:25:39,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See ya!</font>

289
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make sure to get your shots, Eggman!</font>

290
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:59,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. Okay. Let me just say
it is an honor to finally meet you, Sonic.</font>

291
00:25:59,515 --> 00:26:01,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it okay if I call you Sonic?</font>

292
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:03,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone calls me Tails.
You're probably wondering why.</font>

293
00:26:03,978 --> 00:26:06,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me guess. Because of the extra tail?</font>

294
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right!
I should've known you'd get that.</font>

295
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:12,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool. Also, what is going on?
Robotnik's back?</font>

296
00:26:12,236 --> 00:26:14,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And who is
Clifford the Big Red Rage Monster?</font>

297
00:26:15,364 --> 00:26:17,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Knuckles, the last of the Echidnas</font>

298
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:19,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the most dangerous warrior
in the galaxy.</font>

299
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's obsessed with finding
the Master Emerald.</font>

300
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you serious? The Master Emerald?</font>

301
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's just a bedtime story.</font>

302
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he believes it's real.</font>

303
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:30,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he must think
you're the key to finding it.</font>

304
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:34,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Red light! Give me the wheel!</font>

305
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:35,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, what are you--
- Move your foot.</font>

306
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:45,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we lost him.</font>

307
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We did not lose him.
We definitely did not lose him!</font>

308
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got an idea. Do you trust me?</font>

309
00:27:03,037 --> 00:27:05,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course not! I literally just met you!</font>

310
00:27:05,331 --> 00:27:07,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just let me-- Come on!
- What are you doing?</font>

311
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're flying.</font>

312
00:27:28,354 --> 00:27:30,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did your butt just turn into a helicopter?</font>

313
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A butt-copter!</font>

314
00:27:34,026 --> 00:27:37,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only Sonic the Hedgehog
could come up with something like that.</font>

315
00:27:52,461 --> 00:27:54,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Foxy move.</font>

316
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want something done right...</font>

317
00:27:59,218 --> 00:28:02,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you have to hire someone
you can push around.</font>

318
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All caps.</font>

319
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doctor,</font>

320
00:28:25,828 --> 00:28:26,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where are you?</font>

321
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freak.</font>

322
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, folks.</font>

323
00:28:45,431 --> 00:28:47,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to close early. Everybody out!</font>

324
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody out.
Thank you for visiting the Mean Bean.</font>

325
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, good night. Good night.</font>

326
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:13,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's back.</font>

327
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's back!</font>

328
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:14,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's more like it.</font>

329
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been re-hatched!</font>

330
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:33,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, my massively metacarpaled friend,</font>

331
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you mentioned...</font>

332
00:30:37,251 --> 00:30:39,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ultimate power.</font>

333
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back at the house?</font>

334
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Master Emerald?</font>

335
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It does not concern you.</font>

336
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you off that planet
and you brought me to the hedgehog.</font>

337
00:30:46,677 --> 00:30:48,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have no more use for each other.</font>

338
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:51,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I hate to be a contrarian, but...</font>

339
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:53,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we might.</font>

340
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think these machines
are a match for me?</font>

341
00:30:57,271 --> 00:31:00,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will shatter them
like the bones from a fallen--</font>

342
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:02,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are stairs.</font>

343
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:12,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, Earth is my turf, G.</font>

344
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you don't know how to floss,
you'll be lost without me.</font>

345
00:31:15,956 --> 00:31:18,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand nothing
of what you just said.</font>

346
00:31:18,584 --> 00:31:22,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I help you retrieve the Emerald,
and you use it to...</font>

347
00:31:24,256 --> 00:31:28,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">destroy the hedgehog!</font>

348
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're suggesting an alliance.</font>

349
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:35,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Around here we simply
grip each other's hands tightly.</font>

350
00:31:41,273 --> 00:31:44,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You truculent space bumpkin!</font>

351
00:31:44,985 --> 00:31:47,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've crushed my favorite hand!</font>

352
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? My hand is uninjured.</font>

353
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm now convinced of your commitment.</font>

354
00:31:53,285 --> 00:31:55,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Oh, goody,"</font>

355
00:31:55,287 --> 00:31:58,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he exclaimed,
while he reset two of his knuckles.</font>

356
00:31:58,874 --> 00:32:01,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm...</font>

357
00:32:01,293 --> 00:32:05,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">delighted to be on the same team.</font>

358
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Road trip!</font>

359
00:32:16,016 --> 00:32:18,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll let you stick your nose
out the window.</font>

360
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic, where are we?</font>

361
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to the Wade Cave.</font>

362
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which is something
I hope to someday say to a woman.</font>

363
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A woman who's not my mom.</font>

364
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wade, focus.</font>

365
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:35,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to figure out why Knuckles thinks
I'm the key to finding the Master Emerald.</font>

366
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And why did he mention Longclaw?</font>

367
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:40,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There must be a connection.</font>

368
00:32:40,624 --> 00:32:42,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute. There is.</font>

369
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:46,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look. There's an emerald symbol
on the map Longclaw gave me.</font>

370
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never knew what it meant before.</font>

371
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something's happening.</font>

372
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:05,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Longclaw?</font>

373
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Sonic.</font>

374
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:10,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're watching this,
then something has happened to me.</font>

375
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:13,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I pray
you've made it to Earth unharmed.</font>

376
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:18,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This world has been chosen
for a very important reason.</font>

377
00:33:18,245 --> 00:33:21,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the secret location
of the Master Emerald.</font>

378
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:27,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Emerald has the power
to turn thoughts into reality.</font>

379
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man
from Ghostbusters.</font>

380
00:33:31,383 --> 00:33:35,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the wrong hands it could threaten
all life in the universe.</font>

381
00:33:35,554 --> 00:33:38,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Protecting the Emerald was my sacred duty.</font>

382
00:33:38,557 --> 00:33:42,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now I must pass
that responsibility to you.</font>

383
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is my moment.</font>

384
00:33:46,106 --> 00:33:49,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow the map, find the Emerald,
and keep it safe.</font>

385
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My dear Sonic,</font>

386
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you have a heart
like no creature I've ever known.</font>

387
00:33:55,407 --> 00:33:57,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you so much.</font>

388
00:33:58,744 --> 00:33:59,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goodbye.</font>

389
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, wait.</font>

390
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won't let you down, Longclaw.</font>

391
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:17,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So is that your dad?</font>

392
00:34:17,304 --> 00:34:18,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

393
00:34:18,847 --> 00:34:19,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No?</font>

394
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:23,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">According to this map,
the first clue is in Siberia.</font>

395
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a compass
that will lead to the Emerald.</font>

396
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:28,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And with Knuckles already here,
it's a race.</font>

397
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:29,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Knuckles?</font>

398
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew a kid in middle school
named Knuckles.</font>

399
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could fit his whole fist in his mouth.</font>

400
00:34:34,446 --> 00:34:38,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If this is the same Knuckles,
we are screwed.</font>

401
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This Knuckles, that Knuckles.
It doesn't matter.</font>

402
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:42,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna get there first.</font>

403
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean, "we"?</font>

404
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:48,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're coming with me.</font>

405
00:34:49,044 --> 00:34:50,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.</font>

406
00:34:50,462 --> 00:34:53,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just came here to warn you.
I'm not a field guy.</font>

407
00:34:53,757 --> 00:34:57,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry. I got your back.
I won't let anything happen to you.</font>

408
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:02,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a power bump.
On Earth, it means an unbreakable promise.</font>

409
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I'm in.</font>

410
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doctor. It's really you.</font>

411
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look different.</font>

412
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:29,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Papa's got a brand new 'stache.</font>

413
00:35:32,546 --> 00:35:36,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew it. I knew it!
I knew you'd come back, sir.</font>

414
00:35:36,258 --> 00:35:38,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never stopped steaming
your Austrian goat's milk.</font>

415
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could use some mushroom.</font>

416
00:35:47,811 --> 00:35:48,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You brought something.</font>

417
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some kind of space porcupine.</font>

418
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:56,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Porcupine? I am an Echidna!</font>

419
00:35:56,111 --> 00:35:58,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trained since birth
in all forms of lethal combat,</font>

420
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">destined to restore honor to my tribe,</font>

421
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:04,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and willing to destroy
anything that gets in my way.</font>

422
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to the team.</font>

423
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That means he trusts you, Stone.</font>

424
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:18,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now let's renovate this dump!</font>

425
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:21,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Latte with steamed Austrian goat milk!</font>

426
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:42,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good one. Solid.</font>

427
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sorry, fellas.
- That's game!</font>

428
00:36:52,584 --> 00:36:54,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how we do!</font>

429
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:57,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- But are they good at math?
- Teamwork makes the dream work!</font>

430
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry about that, Big Tom.</font>

431
00:36:59,758 --> 00:37:01,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you good?
- All good. Fine.</font>

432
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:04,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks for inviting me out to hang
with you and your groomsmen.</font>

433
00:37:05,013 --> 00:37:06,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good quality bonding.</font>

434
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, bro,</font>

435
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">those guys right there,
they're way more than my groomsmen.</font>

436
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my squad.</font>

437
00:37:12,187 --> 00:37:14,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never would've made it through life
without 'em.</font>

438
00:37:14,314 --> 00:37:15,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get over here!</font>

439
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'm coming!</font>

440
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll catch you later.
- Hey. Yeah!</font>

441
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me know if you're ready
for some power yoga.</font>

442
00:37:22,906 --> 00:37:25,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You bet.
- Come on, Tommy boy. Let's go.</font>

443
00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:27,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't make me.</font>

444
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What am I doing?</font>

445
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:30,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Uncle Tommy!</font>

446
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, girls!</font>

447
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:35,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How you do-- Are those the wedding rings?
- Uh-huh.</font>

448
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:36,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">May I?</font>

449
00:37:36,795 --> 00:37:40,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This little ring bearer
has been taking her job very seriously.</font>

450
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She's been practicing all morning.
- I can see that.</font>

451
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How very responsible of you.</font>

452
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except aren't there supposed
to be two wedding rings?</font>

453
00:37:47,514 --> 00:37:48,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-oh.</font>

454
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:53,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uncle Tommy?
- Hang on. What's going on here?</font>

455
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:56,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna do great, kiddo.</font>

456
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye.</font>

457
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, baby</font>

458
00:38:02,654 --> 00:38:04,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right! Groom in the building!</font>

459
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at those guys.</font>

460
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish Sonic had that.</font>

461
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Muscles?
- Control yourself.</font>

462
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:15,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Buddies. Wingmen. A squad.</font>

463
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:19,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic doesn't have anything like that.
He's flying solo.</font>

464
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Baby, you got to relax.</font>

465
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:24,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're at the Four Seasons.</font>

466
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have a mai tai.
Spend some time with your wife.</font>

467
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what he said.
Seriously, his exact words.</font>

468
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:34,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See? He's a smart kid. He'll find his way.</font>

469
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:38,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I absolutely cannot find my way.</font>

470
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are completely, totally,
unequivocally lost.</font>

471
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic, in this weather,</font>

472
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there's no way we're gonna get
any readings on this thing!</font>

473
00:38:47,866 --> 00:38:49,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Should we go back?
- No, no, no.</font>

474
00:38:49,701 --> 00:38:52,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a light up ahead.
Maybe we can take shelter in there.</font>

475
00:38:58,544 --> 00:38:59,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perfect.</font>

476
00:38:59,711 --> 00:39:02,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure about this?
We don't know who's inside.</font>

477
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:06,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry.
On Earth, people are very welcoming,</font>

478
00:39:06,301 --> 00:39:09,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and love taking complete strangers
into their homes.</font>

479
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:40,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run.</font>

480
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Table for two, please!</font>

481
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would you like to order?</font>

482
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two beef stews, please.</font>

483
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:59,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where'd you get all these cool gadgets?
- I invented 'em.</font>

484
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's kinda my thing.</font>

485
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:04,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In fact,
my inventions are how I discovered you.</font>

486
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember that night at the baseball field?</font>

487
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:11,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your energy blast reached all the way
to my home planet.</font>

488
00:40:11,366 --> 00:40:15,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saw you save your whole village
from that crazy mustache guy.</font>

489
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, so you've been watching me
this whole time?</font>

490
00:40:19,374 --> 00:40:20,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even in the shower?</font>

491
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a trick question.</font>

492
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic the Hedgehog prefers bubble baths.</font>

493
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, you're good!</font>

494
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I learned Knuckles was on your trail,</font>

495
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:32,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew I couldn't just sit back
and watch anymore.</font>

496
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had to come warn you.</font>

497
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Hang on one sec.</font>

498
00:40:36,683 --> 00:40:38,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Donut Lord is checking in.</font>

499
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:43,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Just chilling. Watching TV."</font>

500
00:40:44,399 --> 00:40:46,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dot, dot, dot.</font>

501
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dot, dot, dot.</font>

502
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dot, dot, dot.</font>

503
00:40:51,531 --> 00:40:53,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dot, dot, dot.</font>

504
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:56,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dot, dot, dot.</font>

505
00:40:56,995 --> 00:40:57,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doctor,</font>

506
00:40:58,997 --> 00:41:01,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">why are we working with this imbecile?</font>

507
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:07,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because that simpleminded space trash
is the key to something extraordinary.</font>

508
00:41:08,173 --> 00:41:10,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something to help you get revenge
on the hedgehog.</font>

509
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think bigger, Stone.</font>

510
00:41:13,011 --> 00:41:16,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The emerald he seeks
could power my wildest designs.</font>

511
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My genius wouldn't just be recognized
on Earth.</font>

512
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It would spread virally
to every corner of the galaxy,</font>

513
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:25,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">allowing me to harness
all the negative forces of the universe</font>

514
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and commune with Darkness itself.</font>

515
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:30,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. That sounds big.</font>

516
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been on my vision board for years.
It's the Law of Attraction.</font>

517
00:41:34,616 --> 00:41:35,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't you see The Secret?</font>

518
00:41:37,285 --> 00:41:39,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kaplooey!</font>

519
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kaplooey.</font>

520
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Another boring night at home."</font>

521
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The hedgehog has returned home!</font>

522
00:41:45,919 --> 00:41:49,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Falsa. Which is Latin for "wrong-o."</font>

523
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:54,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">According to my worldwide network
cell tower triangulation, he's lying,</font>

524
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all the way</font>

525
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:01,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from the majestic hinterlands
of Eastern Siberia.</font>

526
00:42:01,935 --> 00:42:05,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a long-distance liar!</font>

527
00:42:09,776 --> 00:42:11,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, there's more where that came from.</font>

528
00:42:14,364 --> 00:42:16,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tiny magic hedgehog destroyed.</font>

529
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now let's begin our quest.</font>

530
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:23,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait.</font>

531
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about your minion? The goat milker.</font>

532
00:42:27,085 --> 00:42:29,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no room on the ship for Stone.</font>

533
00:42:29,504 --> 00:42:32,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I say we ditch him,
ghost him, blow him off.</font>

534
00:42:32,382 --> 00:42:33,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dishonor!</font>

535
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Dis" is how I roll.</font>

536
00:42:45,395 --> 00:42:48,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, but I asked for the beef stew.</font>

537
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:52,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your breath smells like goat poop.</font>

538
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you say?</font>

539
00:42:58,492 --> 00:42:59,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on?</font>

540
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe they think it's my birthday?</font>

541
00:43:04,289 --> 00:43:07,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry, I'll take care of this.
Okay, everybody, take it easy.</font>

542
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure there's
a perfectly good explanation</font>

543
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for whatever my friend said or did.</font>

544
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:14,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand back.</font>

545
00:43:14,382 --> 00:43:15,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just farted.</font>

546
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meow?</font>

547
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:24,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Throw these monsters in the fire!</font>

548
00:43:28,438 --> 00:43:31,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, no. Come on, guys.
Take it easy. Let's talk this through.</font>

549
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's talk this through!</font>

550
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:37,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on.
Scanning Siberian customs.</font>

551
00:43:37,322 --> 00:43:41,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There's got to be something in here.
- Tails, whatever you're doing, do it fast.</font>

552
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:42,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I got it!</font>

553
00:43:42,285 --> 00:43:44,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pivonka! Pivonkal</font>

554
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:46,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pivonka!</font>

555
00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:15,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da.</font>

556
00:44:15,902 --> 00:44:17,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pivonka!</font>

557
00:44:18,738 --> 00:44:20,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tails, what's a "pivonkad'?</font>

558
00:44:21,032 --> 00:44:23,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a Siberian custom
to resolve disputes.</font>

559
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:26,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we win, they let us go. If we lose...</font>

560
00:44:32,085 --> 00:44:35,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, we have to grab the map
and get out of here. Where's the map?</font>

561
00:44:35,505 --> 00:44:38,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no. I left it on the table! Look!</font>

562
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

563
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:13,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, it's a dance fight.</font>

564
00:45:14,419 --> 00:45:16,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic, what do we do?</font>

565
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:19,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We dance and get that map.</font>

566
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go.</font>

567
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, now let's do-- No, we're gonna go--</font>

568
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:34,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

569
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:47,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, this is not going well.
Channing Tatum makes it look so easy.</font>

570
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, Sonic. Look!</font>

571
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The map! Come on, let's grab it!</font>

572
00:46:00,423 --> 00:46:01,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want?</font>

573
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come get.</font>

574
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freaks!</font>

575
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freaks!</font>

576
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:09,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!</font>

577
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:12,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!</font>

578
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!</font>

579
00:46:14,312 --> 00:46:15,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!</font>

580
00:46:15,855 --> 00:46:18,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong, Tails? Come on. I need you!</font>

581
00:46:18,608 --> 00:46:21,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't do this, Sonic.
I'm not brave like you.</font>

582
00:46:21,611 --> 00:46:24,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My gadget got us in this mess,
and I lost your map,</font>

583
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:26,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we're gonna get tossed into a fire!</font>

584
00:46:31,329 --> 00:46:33,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">New deejay coming in.</font>

585
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, pal. I got an idea.</font>

586
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They called us freaks,</font>

587
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:42,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so let's get freaky.</font>

588
00:46:42,924 --> 00:46:45,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just follow my moves. You'll be fine.</font>

589
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:16,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right! Backup dancers!</font>

590
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:22,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go!</font>

591
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a lot of me up here!</font>

592
00:47:51,242 --> 00:47:53,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love pivonka!</font>

593
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:59,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And big dismount!</font>

594
00:48:01,669 --> 00:48:02,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

595
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:07,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take that.</font>

596
00:48:13,556 --> 00:48:14,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We did it!</font>

597
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:17,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was amazing! Way to go, Tails.</font>

598
00:48:26,736 --> 00:48:31,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. Only Sonic the Hedgehog
could win a dance battle that epic.</font>

599
00:48:31,324 --> 00:48:32,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, stick with me, pal.</font>

600
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:36,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Earth can be a scary place, but I know
everything about this old pale blue dot.</font>

601
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:38,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you really mean that?</font>

602
00:48:38,706 --> 00:48:42,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, not everything. But I watch
a lot of Discovery Channel and--</font>

603
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:45,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I meant about me being your pal.</font>

604
00:48:46,881 --> 00:48:48,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, buddy.</font>

605
00:48:51,594 --> 00:48:52,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Comin' in hot.</font>

606
00:48:53,471 --> 00:48:56,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Growing up, I didn't have any friends.</font>

607
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:59,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone in my village
thought my two tails were weird.</font>

608
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I know that feeling.</font>

609
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:05,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But then I saw you,
the fastest creature in the galaxy.</font>

610
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:09,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were weird too. But you were a legend.</font>

611
00:49:09,612 --> 00:49:12,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That made me think,
maybe being weird isn't so bad.</font>

612
00:49:13,491 --> 00:49:16,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You inspired me to leave my village,</font>

613
00:49:16,494 --> 00:49:19,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to find you and help you in your mission.</font>

614
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:21,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm really glad you're here, Tails.</font>

615
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:23,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm glad I'm here 00, Sonic.</font>

616
00:49:29,799 --> 00:49:32,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, might as well get some sleep.</font>

617
00:49:32,802 --> 00:49:35,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This feels like a good place
to spend the night.</font>

618
00:49:35,346 --> 00:49:37,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be able to get clear readings
on your gizmo thing</font>

619
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:39,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">once the storm is over, so I--</font>

620
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Night, Tails.</font>

621
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:09,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tails. Tails. We have a situation.</font>

622
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:19,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today's forecast calls for
clear, sunny skies</font>

623
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a 100% chance of adventure.</font>

624
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:25,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I pinpointed the coordinates.
It's right up ahead.</font>

625
00:50:28,149 --> 00:50:29,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

626
00:50:39,702 --> 00:50:40,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Tails. Wait up.</font>

627
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:50,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, we got a giant owl door.
Seems encouraging.</font>

628
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check this out.</font>

629
00:51:05,311 --> 00:51:08,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can you translate that?
- Yeah.</font>

630
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:12,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ages ago, a fearsome group of warriors,</font>

631
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">known as the Echidnas,</font>

632
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">forged the Seven Chaos Emeralds</font>

633
00:51:16,781 --> 00:51:20,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">info the most unstoppable weapon
ever created.</font>

634
00:51:23,454 --> 00:51:25,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Master Emerald.</font>

635
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With it, a single warrior</font>

636
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:30,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">could defeat entire armies.</font>

637
00:51:33,047 --> 00:51:35,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Believing no one should have such power,</font>

638
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:39,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">an order of heroes recovered the Emerald</font>

639
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:41,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and swore to protect it from evil.</font>

640
00:51:42,932 --> 00:51:44,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds like the Owls and the Echidnas</font>

641
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:47,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have been fighting each other
for centuries.</font>

642
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:49,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like Vin Diesel and The Rock.</font>

643
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:52,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait for me.</font>

644
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:02,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, giant owl door, giant owl.
Makes sense.</font>

645
00:52:14,547 --> 00:52:17,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a second.
I've seen these symbols before.</font>

646
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:22,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go.</font>

647
00:52:31,272 --> 00:52:32,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that did something.</font>

648
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:53,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The compass!
- This will lead us to the Emerald!</font>

649
00:52:59,133 --> 00:53:01,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you got a little something on your--</font>

650
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:04,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no. Tails, get back.</font>

651
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run!</font>

652
00:53:17,151 --> 00:53:18,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That guy again?</font>

653
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:22,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heads up, my little stalagmites.
Someone call an Uber?</font>

654
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, thanks for doing all the hard stuff.</font>

655
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:31,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we'll take it from here.</font>

656
00:53:31,165 --> 00:53:33,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, we really gotta talk
about your new look.</font>

657
00:53:33,751 --> 00:53:36,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like Professor X
meets the Monopoly man.</font>

658
00:53:36,587 --> 00:53:40,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what kind of genius
shows up to Siberia in a convertible?</font>

659
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:43,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The kind of genius
that can turn up the heat...</font>

660
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:46,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with a flick of a switch.</font>

661
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:00,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good one! I'm sure that wasn't important.</font>

662
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:05,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tails, that's our exit. Come on.</font>

663
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:20,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's split up.</font>

664
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You go high, I go low.
- Right.</font>

665
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quick little stretch and here we go.</font>

666
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:38,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you want to play?</font>

667
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:45,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's new.</font>

668
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:57,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic!</font>

669
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:12,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Snowball fight!</font>

670
00:55:18,314 --> 00:55:22,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's too easy. Come on, challenge me!</font>

671
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:39,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are talking style and pizzazz.</font>

672
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:49,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah! I make this look good.</font>

673
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, great. The Winter Soldier.</font>

674
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:03,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For a guy named Knuckles,
you are really bad at punching.</font>

675
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:07,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surrender the compass!
You are no match for me.</font>

676
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:09,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been training for this
my entire life.</font>

677
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:13,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I had no training at all,
yet here I am ahead of you.</font>

678
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:15,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's gotta be embarrassing.</font>

679
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:22,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My rings!</font>

680
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:29,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Has anyone ever told you
you've got serious anger issues?</font>

681
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mock me with your weak jokes,</font>

682
00:56:32,221 --> 00:56:34,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you know nothing about me, hedgehog.</font>

683
00:56:34,515 --> 00:56:38,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I know you Echidnas have a habit of
showing up uninvited and ruining my life.</font>

684
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:42,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ruining your life? Another bad joke.</font>

685
00:56:42,106 --> 00:56:44,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I lost everything because of you.</font>

686
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:48,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My tribe was on the verge
of its greatest victory.</font>

687
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:51,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The last of the Owl warriors
had been located.</font>

688
00:56:51,365 --> 00:56:55,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Soon Longclaw's Emerald secrets
would be ours.</font>

689
00:56:55,202 --> 00:56:58,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But my father stopped me
from joining the fight.</font>

690
00:56:58,497 --> 00:57:02,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He said my moment
to honor our tribe would come,</font>

691
00:57:02,126 --> 00:57:04,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it was not this moment.</font>

692
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those were the last words he spoke to me.</font>

693
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:09,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never saw him again.</font>

694
00:57:10,968 --> 00:57:13,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We both lost everything that day.</font>

695
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:17,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Goodbye, Sonic.
- No!</font>

696
00:57:17,516 --> 00:57:19,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Longclaw!</font>

697
00:57:23,689 --> 00:57:25,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic! Are you okay?</font>

698
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:26,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deceiver!</font>

699
00:57:27,443 --> 00:57:29,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it wasn't a trick.</font>

700
00:57:30,112 --> 00:57:32,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tails, take the compass
and get out of here!</font>

701
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

702
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:40,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Later, haters!</font>

703
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:44,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tails!</font>

704
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:53,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tails, come on. Wake up.</font>

705
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:56,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He chose helping the fox
over pursuing the compass.</font>

706
00:57:56,472 --> 00:58:00,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course he did.
New friend, same pathetic weakness.</font>

707
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:13,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no. No, no, no.
We're in real trouble here.</font>

708
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:16,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Tails. I need you to fly us
out of here. Time to wake up.</font>

709
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:27,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See ya, kids. Enjoy the fresh powder.</font>

710
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you...</font>

711
00:58:59,618 --> 00:59:02,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These rings signify the--</font>

712
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:09,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

713
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thought it was on silent.</font>

714
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These rings--</font>

715
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:22,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So help me, Thomas!</font>

716
00:59:27,563 --> 00:59:29,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, sorry.</font>

717
00:59:29,106 --> 00:59:30,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, this is an emergency.</font>

718
00:59:32,401 --> 00:59:33,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

719
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:41,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? This better be important. I just--</font>

720
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you skiing?</font>

721
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:45,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Snowboarding, actually.
But I need your help now.</font>

722
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Life or death situation this very second.</font>

723
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to use the ring I gave you
to save me. Like right now.</font>

724
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, slow down.
I don't even know where you are.</font>

725
00:59:53,255 --> 00:59:55,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just gotta picture
where you want the ring to go.</font>

726
00:59:55,549 --> 00:59:56,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So picture this.</font>

727
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:02,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God. Okay, okay. Hang on.</font>

728
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:11,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

729
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:14,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you throw it?</font>

730
01:00:15,319 --> 01:00:17,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, God.
- What? Tell me what "Oh, God."</font>

731
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:19,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mixed up the rings
when I was teasing Jojo.</font>

732
01:00:19,448 --> 01:00:20,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Where is it then?</font>

733
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't want to know.</font>

734
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:27,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I do, Tom.</font>

735
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I very much want to know,</font>

736
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:31,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before I become
a hedgehog-flavored snow cone.</font>

737
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:34,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang tight, buddy. I got this.</font>

738
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:35,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With this ring, Rachel...</font>

739
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:37,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Hi.</font>

740
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything okay, bud?</font>

741
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:42,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Not really.
- What are you doing?</font>

742
01:00:42,304 --> 01:00:45,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is gonna sound crazy, but I need
to see that ring for just one second.</font>

743
01:00:45,891 --> 01:00:48,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Have you lost your mind?
- I'm gonna give it right back, I promise.</font>

744
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:51,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Please, Randall, it's really important.
- No, bro. Go sit down.</font>

745
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:54,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Give me the ring, please?
- Randall, don't look at him, look at me.</font>

746
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- One second.
- Put the ring on my finger.</font>

747
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:59,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, Randall, listen to me.
- Randall! Look at me. Ring on my finger.</font>

748
01:00:59,363 --> 01:01:01,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Give me the ring! Just one second.
- Put a ring on it!</font>

749
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:03,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, love? Okay?</font>

750
01:01:04,034 --> 01:01:05,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- With this ring--
- Yes, baby.</font>

751
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry about this.</font>

752
01:01:17,047 --> 01:01:19,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Snow, my God.
- Oh, boy.</font>

753
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:22,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Incoming!</font>

754
01:01:32,938 --> 01:01:34,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anybody hurt?</font>

755
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sonic!
- Hawaii.</font>

756
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:37,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>

757
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:39,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's happening? Are you hurt?</font>

758
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, no, I'm fine.
- Okay, good.</font>

759
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:45,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Because you're in so much trouble!
- Okay, you calm down.</font>

760
01:01:45,534 --> 01:01:46,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You talk.</font>

761
01:01:46,952 --> 01:01:48,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, quick version.</font>

762
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:51,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Robotnik is back on Earth
and he's after a magic emerald.</font>

763
01:01:52,791 --> 01:01:55,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to get it back
or the world is doomed.</font>

764
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:57,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tails!</font>

765
01:01:57,254 --> 01:02:00,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wait! All this happened since yesterday?
- Wait. Who's Tails?</font>

766
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:02,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tails, can you hear me?</font>

767
01:02:02,134 --> 01:02:04,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Lord, there are two of them now.</font>

768
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:06,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, let me think. Tails, come on, buddy.</font>

769
01:02:11,101 --> 01:02:12,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

770
01:02:12,561 --> 01:02:14,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Randall, why do all of your friends
have weapons?</font>

771
01:02:16,815 --> 01:02:20,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You really should have taken me up
on that brunch, Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski.</font>

772
01:02:20,861 --> 01:02:21,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Olive Garden guy?</font>

773
01:02:21,987 --> 01:02:24,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, everyone. We're federal agents.</font>

774
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:27,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You, too, Agent. Go ahead.</font>

775
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:38,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean to tell me
that this entire wedding was a setup?</font>

776
01:02:38,462 --> 01:02:40,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Rachel, wait a minute.
- What?</font>

777
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:41,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's correct, ma'am.</font>

778
01:02:41,423 --> 01:02:44,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every single aspect of Operation Catfish
was a complete fabrication.</font>

779
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Operation Catfish?</font>

780
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:49,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So is everyone here an agent?</font>

781
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:52,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you an agent?</font>

782
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:54,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a...</font>

783
01:02:54,895 --> 01:02:58,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was the florist an agent?
How about the photographer?</font>

784
01:02:58,857 --> 01:03:00,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The woman who waxed my...</font>

785
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at the spa?</font>

786
01:03:04,446 --> 01:03:06,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is Jojo an agent?
- Rachel.</font>

787
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Rachel, listen to me.</font>

788
01:03:09,201 --> 01:03:12,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm done listening! I am done listening!</font>

789
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:15,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am so sorry. I am so sorry.</font>

790
01:03:15,916 --> 01:03:17,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really am. I am so sorry.</font>

791
01:03:19,461 --> 01:03:21,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Hey, no!</font>

792
01:03:22,506 --> 01:03:24,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let him go! Hey!</font>

793
01:03:27,636 --> 01:03:28,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic, hang on.</font>

794
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:31,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Take it easy. It's not worth it.
- Tom!</font>

795
01:03:32,891 --> 01:03:35,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic is not a threat. He's on our side.</font>

796
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:37,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's an uncontrolled extraterrestrial.</font>

797
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:39,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And your days of aiding
and abetting him are over.</font>

798
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:42,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Secure them in the hotel
until the chopper arrives.</font>

799
01:03:43,193 --> 01:03:44,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're making a mistake.</font>

800
01:03:44,528 --> 01:03:46,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on, Major A-hole!</font>

801
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:48,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is still my day,</font>

802
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:52,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and someone is gonna explain to me
what the hell is going on here!</font>

803
01:03:52,202 --> 01:03:55,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After the events in San Francisco,
a global task force was created,</font>

804
01:03:55,622 --> 01:03:58,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">devoted to protecting our planet
from alien threats.</font>

805
01:03:58,917 --> 01:04:01,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That day,
Guardian Units of Nations was born.</font>

806
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:04,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- G-U-N. Seriously?
- GUN, yeah.</font>

807
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, what about protecting our planet
from Dr. Robotnik?</font>

808
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:09,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Robotnik is dead.</font>

809
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're wrong. He's back.</font>

810
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:14,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you just hauled away the only ones
who could stop him.</font>

811
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds like Robotnik
might be back in play.</font>

812
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:21,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he is, I want him found immediately.</font>

813
01:04:22,983 --> 01:04:25,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And cancel my five o'clock
at the Olive Garden.</font>

814
01:04:25,652 --> 01:04:27,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Aunt Maddie?
- Yeah.</font>

815
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:29,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic and his friend dropped this.</font>

816
01:04:35,871 --> 01:04:37,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have an idea.</font>

817
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I want to have a word with my fiancé.</font>

818
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that word is "murder."</font>

819
01:04:46,715 --> 01:04:48,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, come on.
You can't just leave us in here.</font>

820
01:04:48,842 --> 01:04:51,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My friend is hurt!
He needs a doctor, a vet, anyone!</font>

821
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:56,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tails, you got to wake up, buddy.
Please wake up.</font>

822
01:05:04,525 --> 01:05:05,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All clear.</font>

823
01:05:09,279 --> 01:05:10,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Game plan.</font>

824
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:13,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get inside the hotel and find
where they're hiding Tom and Sonic.</font>

825
01:05:13,992 --> 01:05:15,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I find Randall, right?</font>

826
01:05:15,702 --> 01:05:17,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then I squeeze the breath</font>

827
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:21,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from his lying, deceitful,
perfectly manscaped body!</font>

828
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:25,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going through a lot right now.</font>

829
01:05:25,462 --> 01:05:28,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So let me process this my own way, okay?
- Sure, sure.</font>

830
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:30,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No judgment.
- Should've brought a journal.</font>

831
01:05:30,926 --> 01:05:32,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay--</font>

832
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:35,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Is this meant to be a weapon?
This is adorable.</font>

833
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:38,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take that, Randall!</font>

834
01:05:39,059 --> 01:05:40,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run, Randall!</font>

835
01:05:40,352 --> 01:05:41,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

836
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:43,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We're about to find out.
- All right!</font>

837
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:45,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go kick some booty.</font>

838
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:00,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rachel! No. Rachel!</font>

839
01:06:01,915 --> 01:06:02,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In a minute.</font>

840
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:09,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop right there!</font>

841
01:06:10,382 --> 01:06:11,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get the bag.</font>

842
01:06:19,808 --> 01:06:21,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's gonna come back down, right?</font>

843
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:22,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

844
01:06:22,978 --> 01:06:23,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck!</font>

845
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:28,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look. Tom and Sonic have to be inside.</font>

846
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:30,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a fiancée to vaporize.</font>

847
01:06:31,069 --> 01:06:32,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Watch your back, sis.
- Okay.</font>

848
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:36,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Randall!</font>

849
01:06:44,082 --> 01:06:46,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got her. Move in.</font>

850
01:06:50,547 --> 01:06:51,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

851
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:09,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did not mean to do that!</font>

852
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:23,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something bothering you, Agent?</font>

853
01:07:23,956 --> 01:07:26,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just feel a little guilty
about what I did to Rachel, sir.</font>

854
01:07:27,751 --> 01:07:30,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry about it.
We'll send her a gift card.</font>

855
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:32,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I propose a toast.</font>

856
01:07:35,425 --> 01:07:38,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To a perfectly executed operation.</font>

857
01:07:42,891 --> 01:07:44,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, we're under attack.</font>

858
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:08,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Randall, wifey's home!</font>

859
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:14,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God. Rachel.</font>

860
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:42,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a woman.</font>

861
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:45,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You no-good,</font>

862
01:08:46,913 --> 01:08:49,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lowdown, dirty, lying--</font>

863
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rachel, just listen to me.</font>

864
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:55,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of twisted sicko
tricks someone into a fake wedding?</font>

865
01:08:57,966 --> 01:09:00,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Party's over, Bridezilla.
Stop right there.</font>

866
01:09:01,511 --> 01:09:03,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You son of a--</font>

867
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:05,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Have it your way.
- No!</font>

868
01:09:05,974 --> 01:09:07,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

869
01:09:12,522 --> 01:09:14,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very disappointing, Agent Handel.</font>

870
01:09:17,778 --> 01:09:21,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is that supposed to be a weapon?
- I don't know, but we gonna find out.</font>

871
01:09:21,281 --> 01:09:23,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Haven't you caused enough trouble
for one day?</font>

872
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:26,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't even begun causing trouble.</font>

873
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:29,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell hath no fury like a bride scorned.</font>

874
01:09:36,713 --> 01:09:39,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like it's real, huh?</font>

875
01:09:43,261 --> 01:09:44,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Right.</font>

876
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:49,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be honest. How bad is it?</font>

877
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:52,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not bad at all.
You got Tased. You'll be fine.</font>

878
01:09:56,900 --> 01:10:00,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm so cold.
- You landed on our ice sculpture.</font>

879
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:01,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get up.</font>

880
01:10:09,204 --> 01:10:12,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just tell me the truth, for once.</font>

881
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:17,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there anything about you
or about us that was real?</font>

882
01:10:18,213 --> 01:10:21,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rachel, look at me.</font>

883
01:10:22,884 --> 01:10:26,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before I met you, I didn't think
that I was even capable of real happiness.</font>

884
01:10:28,181 --> 01:10:30,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that all changed
when you walked into my life.</font>

885
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I ended up breaking the first rule
of undercover work.</font>

886
01:10:35,021 --> 01:10:36,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which is?</font>

887
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:38,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never fall in love.</font>

888
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:54,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Maddie!
- We're busting out of here.</font>

889
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:55,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd you get past the guards?</font>

890
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:57,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because that little fox
is into some crazy stuff.</font>

891
01:10:57,669 --> 01:10:58,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

892
01:11:00,297 --> 01:11:01,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's go.
- You're amazing.</font>

893
01:11:12,642 --> 01:11:15,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Owls were fools to think
they could hide this.</font>

894
01:11:53,767 --> 01:11:54,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's happening?</font>

895
01:11:56,561 --> 01:11:58,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait for it.</font>

896
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:12,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Eureka!</font>

897
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:14,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've found it!</font>

898
01:12:34,432 --> 01:12:35,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic.</font>

899
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:39,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What is that?
- A big problem.</font>

900
01:12:40,313 --> 01:12:42,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The compass led Robotnik to the Emerald.</font>

901
01:12:42,315 --> 01:12:44,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's got to be hundreds of miles away.</font>

902
01:12:45,777 --> 01:12:49,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Huddle up.
Let's figure out a plan.</font>

903
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:51,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Together.
- There's no time for that.</font>

904
01:12:51,408 --> 01:12:53,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the only one
that can get there fast enough.</font>

905
01:12:53,451 --> 01:12:56,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic, this is way too big for you
to do by yourself.</font>

906
01:12:56,913 --> 01:12:58,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see that little fox over there?</font>

907
01:12:58,999 --> 01:13:02,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He came all the way across the universe
to meet his hero.</font>

908
01:13:02,085 --> 01:13:05,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what did his hero do?
I practically got him killed.</font>

909
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:07,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what? You were right.</font>

910
01:13:08,383 --> 01:13:11,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My moment came and I blew it. I'm no hero.</font>

911
01:13:12,053 --> 01:13:13,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait.</font>

912
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:15,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not letting anyone else get hurt
because of me.</font>

913
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:17,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna fix this while I still can.</font>

914
01:13:19,102 --> 01:13:20,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic!</font>

915
01:13:20,812 --> 01:13:22,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic, wait!</font>

916
01:13:25,066 --> 01:13:26,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on. Wait.</font>

917
01:13:27,027 --> 01:13:29,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't move.
- Take it easy, little guy. You're hurt.</font>

918
01:13:29,613 --> 01:13:33,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we have to help him.
You don't know what he's up against.</font>

919
01:13:40,498 --> 01:13:41,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You believe us now?</font>

920
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:50,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Bob!</font>

921
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:51,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Maria, how you doing?</font>

922
01:13:55,472 --> 01:13:56,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Working on my moves.</font>

923
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:59,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just keepin' it green.
No need to burn the fuel.</font>

924
01:13:59,309 --> 01:14:00,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speaking of fuel--</font>

925
01:14:06,733 --> 01:14:08,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Closed?</font>

926
01:14:09,694 --> 01:14:10,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That doesn't seem right.</font>

927
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:24,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Close.</font>

928
01:14:29,297 --> 01:14:30,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

929
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:33,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Makeover, makeover. Look at you.</font>

930
01:14:33,301 --> 01:14:34,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freeze! Police!</font>

931
01:14:36,012 --> 01:14:38,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, you got robot hands.</font>

932
01:14:38,181 --> 01:14:41,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, they're gloves.
- Get 'em up. Now spread your fingers!</font>

933
01:14:42,894 --> 01:14:45,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now wiggle 'em! Wiggle your digits!</font>

934
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:49,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! Like you just finished
a big musical number.</font>

935
01:14:51,486 --> 01:14:53,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

936
01:14:53,113 --> 01:14:54,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is there a light on your head?</font>

937
01:14:58,451 --> 01:15:00,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause I'm the sheriff
for the weekend, pal.</font>

938
01:15:09,629 --> 01:15:10,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Water.</font>

939
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:12,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did it have to be water?</font>

940
01:15:15,969 --> 01:15:18,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, you can do this.</font>

941
01:15:21,641 --> 01:15:23,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta go fast.</font>

942
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:09,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to die like this!
It's derivative!</font>

943
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make room for Daddy!</font>

944
01:17:20,635 --> 01:17:21,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two and two.</font>

945
01:17:21,886 --> 01:17:25,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great! We're still bipedals, more or less.</font>

946
01:17:28,434 --> 01:17:29,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fire in the hole!</font>

947
01:17:32,188 --> 01:17:35,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've solved it. There is a booby trap
every seven seco--</font>

948
01:17:42,073 --> 01:17:43,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was a little early.</font>

949
01:17:44,951 --> 01:17:48,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So glad it didn't cut off my mustache.</font>

950
01:17:48,621 --> 01:17:51,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Little Red Wrecking Ball.</font>

951
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:54,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you're dying
to get your Emerald on,</font>

952
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:58,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but can we be a little bit more mindful
of our surroundings?</font>

953
01:17:58,506 --> 01:17:59,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">May 1?</font>

954
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:08,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In 30 feet turn left.</font>

955
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:10,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Work smarter, not harder.</font>

956
01:18:32,165 --> 01:18:33,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My pelvis.</font>

957
01:18:37,921 --> 01:18:42,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Secret Temple,
let's see what you've got.</font>

958
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:51,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no! No!</font>

959
01:18:56,564 --> 01:18:57,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

960
01:18:58,733 --> 01:18:59,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

961
01:19:05,698 --> 01:19:07,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have arrived at your destination.</font>

962
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:10,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. That really opened up the space.</font>

963
01:19:10,787 --> 01:19:13,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't even picture it
with an impenetrable wall now.</font>

964
01:19:13,831 --> 01:19:15,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the rubble is always a nice touch.</font>

965
01:19:24,968 --> 01:19:28,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At last. The Master Emerald.</font>

966
01:19:28,763 --> 01:19:30,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ultimate power.</font>

967
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:32,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Soon order will be restored.</font>

968
01:19:33,017 --> 01:19:36,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All because of what we have done together.</font>

969
01:19:36,437 --> 01:19:38,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Such a lovely sentiment, Knuckles.</font>

970
01:19:39,232 --> 01:19:41,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I feel a single tear forming.</font>

971
01:19:44,779 --> 01:19:46,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sadly...</font>

972
01:19:47,198 --> 01:19:51,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're as useful to me now
as a backstage pass to Limp Bizkit.</font>

973
01:20:06,426 --> 01:20:07,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nailed it.</font>

974
01:20:08,678 --> 01:20:12,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This guy is always trying to spoil
a bad thing!</font>

975
01:20:13,558 --> 01:20:16,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys are here, too?
Took the long way, huh?</font>

976
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:18,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is everything a joke to you?</font>

977
01:20:18,396 --> 01:20:21,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why must you constantly interfere
with my destiny?</font>

978
01:20:21,441 --> 01:20:25,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because my destiny is to protect
my friends and family.</font>

979
01:20:25,194 --> 01:20:27,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I just threw up in my mouth.</font>

980
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:32,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you want that emerald,
you're gonna have to go through me.</font>

981
01:20:55,641 --> 01:20:58,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Echidna's taking no prisoners today!</font>

982
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:02,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic has heart,
but will he lose the quill to live?</font>

983
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:08,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to fight you,
but you're not giving me much choice.</font>

984
01:21:14,744 --> 01:21:17,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too easy. Let's do this.</font>

985
01:21:44,649 --> 01:21:49,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you stand still
and die with honor?</font>

986
01:21:49,153 --> 01:21:50,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me think about it.</font>

987
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:54,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I thought about it and I pass.</font>

988
01:22:03,626 --> 01:22:05,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi there, beautiful.</font>

989
01:22:06,379 --> 01:22:08,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the real deal, aren't you?</font>

990
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:12,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where have you been all my life?</font>

991
01:22:16,347 --> 01:22:18,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say goodbye, hedgehog.</font>

992
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:25,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Knuckles, stop.
Robotnik's stealing the Emerald!</font>

993
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:27,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of fool do you take me for?</font>

994
01:22:27,817 --> 01:22:29,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just look.</font>

995
01:22:31,612 --> 01:22:32,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mine.</font>

996
01:22:34,198 --> 01:22:36,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait! That wasn't the deal.</font>

997
01:22:40,371 --> 01:22:42,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You poor, naive creature.</font>

998
01:22:43,082 --> 01:22:44,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not your fault.</font>

999
01:22:44,584 --> 01:22:48,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A more advanced intellect would have seen
this move coming a mile away.</font>

1000
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:50,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or 1.6 kilometers.</font>

1001
01:22:50,631 --> 01:22:53,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I trusted you! You were my friend!</font>

1002
01:23:00,516 --> 01:23:02,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. That just hit me funny.</font>

1003
01:23:03,853 --> 01:23:08,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let this be my final lesson to you,
you dim-witted celestial skin tag.</font>

1004
01:23:09,859 --> 01:23:11,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Friends...</font>

1005
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:15,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are open, honest
and vulnerable with each other.</font>

1006
01:23:15,406 --> 01:23:17,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which means X squared
times the hypotenuse of Y squared,</font>

1007
01:23:18,034 --> 01:23:20,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">divided by the absolute value
of friendship, equals...</font>

1008
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:22,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">dookie!</font>

1009
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:23,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

1010
01:23:31,881 --> 01:23:36,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chaos is power!</font>

1011
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:56,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get out of here!</font>

1012
01:24:09,502 --> 01:24:10,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Knuckles!</font>

1013
01:24:15,132 --> 01:24:18,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Water again? Come on!</font>

1014
01:25:16,736 --> 01:25:20,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You saved me.
- Don't talk to me. I'm not in the mood.</font>

1015
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:26,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How dare you attack me
in my hour of sorrow!</font>

1016
01:25:27,038 --> 01:25:28,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did you save me?</font>

1017
01:25:30,541 --> 01:25:32,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you saved me first,</font>

1018
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:36,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which clearly gave you
a tactical advantage I do not understand.</font>

1019
01:25:36,213 --> 01:25:39,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wasn't a tactic.
I couldn't just let you die.</font>

1020
01:25:40,885 --> 01:25:45,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why? I've been trying to destroy you
since the moment we met.</font>

1021
01:25:45,681 --> 01:25:49,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because being a hero
isn't about taking care of yourself.</font>

1022
01:25:49,685 --> 01:25:53,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's about taking responsibility
for other people.</font>

1023
01:25:55,399 --> 01:25:58,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wise words. An ancient Earth proverb?</font>

1024
01:25:58,736 --> 01:26:01,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, sir,
that's a Wachowski family special.</font>

1025
01:26:01,238 --> 01:26:03,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it from a guy in a rowboat.</font>

1026
01:26:03,991 --> 01:26:05,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone who means a lot to me.</font>

1027
01:26:07,411 --> 01:26:08,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a second. What's that sound?</font>

1028
01:26:11,165 --> 01:26:14,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only Sonic the Hedgehog
needs rescuing this much.</font>

1029
01:26:15,836 --> 01:26:17,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That sly little fox!</font>

1030
01:26:20,257 --> 01:26:22,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Knucklehead. We're not beat yet.</font>

1031
01:26:23,427 --> 01:26:25,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the mountain,
you told me you'd lost everything.</font>

1032
01:26:26,555 --> 01:26:28,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The way I did.</font>

1033
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:30,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you seem so hopeful and free.</font>

1034
01:26:31,894 --> 01:26:35,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you move forward
despite failing again?</font>

1035
01:26:36,232 --> 01:26:39,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And again. And again.
And again. And again.</font>

1036
01:26:39,443 --> 01:26:43,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I didn't fail that much.
But I didn't do this all alone.</font>

1037
01:26:43,155 --> 01:26:45,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found a new family. New friends.</font>

1038
01:26:45,825 --> 01:26:47,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you can too.</font>

1039
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:51,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have to be alone anymore.</font>

1040
01:26:57,044 --> 01:26:59,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you kidding me with that handshake?</font>

1041
01:27:01,841 --> 01:27:03,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm done playing games, pal.</font>

1042
01:27:04,927 --> 01:27:06,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna tell me what I want to know.</font>

1043
01:27:09,098 --> 01:27:12,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I am asking you for the last time...</font>

1044
01:27:14,812 --> 01:27:17,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what would you like on your bagel?</font>

1045
01:27:17,356 --> 01:27:19,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not telling you anything.</font>

1046
01:27:19,358 --> 01:27:22,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that is a display bagel.</font>

1047
01:27:22,361 --> 01:27:25,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't get it with you!
I mean, I've tried everything.</font>

1048
01:27:25,656 --> 01:27:29,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was good cop. I was bad cop.
I was cop who offers you a bagel.</font>

1049
01:27:29,368 --> 01:27:30,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And nothing. It's like--</font>

1050
01:27:30,453 --> 01:27:32,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is a display bagel. Wow.</font>

1051
01:27:41,964 --> 01:27:43,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doctor, you're here.</font>

1052
01:27:45,718 --> 01:27:50,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I'm here, and yet I'm...</font>

1053
01:27:51,932 --> 01:27:53,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not all there.</font>

1054
01:27:53,684 --> 01:27:55,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, are you feeling okay?</font>

1055
01:27:55,269 --> 01:27:59,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm more than okay.</font>

1056
01:28:00,024 --> 01:28:03,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm upgraded.</font>

1057
01:28:03,235 --> 01:28:06,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sinister 3.0.</font>

1058
01:28:06,363 --> 01:28:10,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My game is next level.</font>

1059
01:28:15,456 --> 01:28:16,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

1060
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:23,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can smell the electricity in your brain.</font>

1061
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:29,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You smell like a snack plate.</font>

1062
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:34,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's fair. I had a couple today.</font>

1063
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:36,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit down.</font>

1064
01:28:40,981 --> 01:28:42,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the chair.</font>

1065
01:28:45,611 --> 01:28:46,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know.</font>

1066
01:28:47,863 --> 01:28:50,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Cause he was in the chair,
so I didn't-- Okay.</font>

1067
01:28:51,033 --> 01:28:52,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir? We have a problem.</font>

1068
01:28:58,791 --> 01:29:01,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All teams in position!
- Set up a perimeter!</font>

1069
01:29:01,919 --> 01:29:03,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move! Move! Move!</font>

1070
01:29:18,602 --> 01:29:22,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In correct us, my trusty barnacle.</font>

1071
01:29:23,566 --> 01:29:26,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After all these years,</font>

1072
01:29:26,694 --> 01:29:28,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what I finally got...</font>

1073
01:29:29,572 --> 01:29:31,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is a solution.</font>

1074
01:29:42,251 --> 01:29:44,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Commander.
- Status report.</font>

1075
01:29:44,211 --> 01:29:47,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Robotnik is in there with Stone
and a hostage. Possibly local PD.</font>

1076
01:29:47,673 --> 01:29:51,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not saying he's dumb,
but if he is local PD,</font>

1077
01:29:51,135 --> 01:29:52,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this town's in a lot of trouble.</font>

1078
01:29:53,512 --> 01:29:54,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wade.</font>

1079
01:30:09,194 --> 01:30:10,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1080
01:30:11,155 --> 01:30:13,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rockin' that new spring collection, I see.</font>

1081
01:30:13,782 --> 01:30:18,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if it isn't the Pastry King.</font>

1082
01:30:18,412 --> 01:30:19,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Donut Lord.</font>

1083
01:30:20,039 --> 01:30:21,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A real genius would remember
the name of the guy</font>

1084
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:23,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who helped kick your butt off this planet.</font>

1085
01:30:23,918 --> 01:30:25,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'll do it again if you mess
with Green Hills.</font>

1086
01:30:26,962 --> 01:30:30,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Congratulations on your oh-so-temporary
sense of superiority.</font>

1087
01:30:30,841 --> 01:30:33,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're finished, Robotnik!
We've taken everything.</font>

1088
01:30:33,260 --> 01:30:35,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your lab, your drones, your funding!</font>

1089
01:30:36,055 --> 01:30:39,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's see how big of a man you are
without your silly little robots.</font>

1090
01:30:40,976 --> 01:30:42,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you like to see...</font>

1091
01:30:44,355 --> 01:30:46,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how big a man I can be?</font>

1092
01:30:57,368 --> 01:31:00,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to the new norm.</font>

1093
01:31:10,839 --> 01:31:12,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My God!</font>

1094
01:31:15,719 --> 01:31:19,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doctor! Take me with you!</font>

1095
01:31:43,872 --> 01:31:45,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's taking everything apart.</font>

1096
01:31:46,709 --> 01:31:48,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's building something.</font>

1097
01:31:56,135 --> 01:31:58,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That can only be one thing.</font>

1098
01:31:58,595 --> 01:32:00,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The fearsome power of the Emerald.</font>

1099
01:32:01,056 --> 01:32:05,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If that thing really turns thoughts
into power, we are in big trouble.</font>

1100
01:32:05,144 --> 01:32:07,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Robotnik has a lot of bad thoughts.</font>

1101
01:32:07,271 --> 01:32:10,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Sonic,
are you sure it was a good idea</font>

1102
01:32:10,315 --> 01:32:11,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">bringing you-know-who aboard?</font>

1103
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:15,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Knuckles isn't really a bad guy.
He's just a little mixed up.</font>

1104
01:32:15,738 --> 01:32:17,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not mixed up!</font>

1105
01:32:17,531 --> 01:32:22,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have steely focus. And I'm complex.
And that's a lot for some people.</font>

1106
01:32:23,245 --> 01:32:25,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope you're not still mad
I hit you with that car.</font>

1107
01:32:26,623 --> 01:32:28,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was completely uninjured.</font>

1108
01:32:28,459 --> 01:32:31,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And my revenge will come
when you least expect it, fox.</font>

1109
01:33:03,077 --> 01:33:05,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, you're magnificent!</font>

1110
01:33:05,746 --> 01:33:07,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, sycophant.</font>

1111
01:33:07,873 --> 01:33:10,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your admiration is inevitable.</font>

1112
01:33:20,344 --> 01:33:21,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew it!</font>

1113
01:33:21,887 --> 01:33:24,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.</font>

1114
01:33:25,474 --> 01:33:27,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">World Domination play list.</font>

1115
01:33:40,864 --> 01:33:42,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fall back.</font>

1116
01:33:43,450 --> 01:33:46,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fall back! Quick! Retreat!</font>

1117
01:33:48,288 --> 01:33:50,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How are we supposed to beat this thing?</font>

1118
01:33:50,457 --> 01:33:51,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need a plan.</font>

1119
01:33:51,583 --> 01:33:53,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Knuckles, use your strength to--</font>

1120
01:33:54,211 --> 01:33:56,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jump off the plane. Wow.</font>

1121
01:33:56,630 --> 01:34:00,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, this is what we're gonna do.
Step 1: Light taunting.</font>

1122
01:34:00,634 --> 01:34:02,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Step 2: I have no idea.</font>

1123
01:34:05,514 --> 01:34:06,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic!</font>

1124
01:34:09,852 --> 01:34:11,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice action figure, Eggman.</font>

1125
01:34:11,895 --> 01:34:14,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does it do anything
or just stand there looking ugly?</font>

1126
01:34:18,485 --> 01:34:21,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a blister, he keeps coming back!</font>

1127
01:34:22,156 --> 01:34:25,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's on the okay-to-kill list.
Shoot the missiles. Make a decision.</font>

1128
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need a moment, sir.
I'm trying to figure out how to do this.</font>

1129
01:34:28,078 --> 01:34:30,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you even glance at a manual?</font>

1130
01:34:30,247 --> 01:34:32,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No!
- I'll do it.</font>

1131
01:34:32,499 --> 01:34:33,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pardon my lightning.</font>

1132
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:35,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You might want to ground yourself.</font>

1133
01:34:38,046 --> 01:34:39,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-oh.</font>

1134
01:34:39,131 --> 01:34:41,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna pop that thing open
like a can of chili--</font>

1135
01:34:44,219 --> 01:34:45,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on!</font>

1136
01:34:58,984 --> 01:35:01,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah!
- Close one.</font>

1137
01:35:02,029 --> 01:35:03,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic!</font>

1138
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:08,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Robotnik!</font>

1139
01:35:10,078 --> 01:35:11,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deceiver!</font>

1140
01:35:11,622 --> 01:35:13,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Die, mosquito.</font>

1141
01:35:25,844 --> 01:35:26,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I felt that.</font>

1142
01:35:46,031 --> 01:35:47,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What just happened?</font>

1143
01:35:47,574 --> 01:35:50,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the Stache Masher.
Right here in the manual.</font>

1144
01:35:53,121 --> 01:35:55,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Return to sender.</font>

1145
01:36:03,048 --> 01:36:04,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stone?</font>

1146
01:36:05,884 --> 01:36:10,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great. Next thing you know, there'll be
a report about a hostile work environment.</font>

1147
01:36:13,141 --> 01:36:16,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those were our best attacks,
and they did nothing!</font>

1148
01:36:16,395 --> 01:36:20,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't beat Robotnik as long as he's got
that Emerald. He's too powerful.</font>

1149
01:36:20,315 --> 01:36:23,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, we aren't strong enough
to beat Robotnik on our own.</font>

1150
01:36:23,485 --> 01:36:24,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But there's three of us.</font>

1151
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:27,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your strength, your smarts and my speed.</font>

1152
01:36:28,073 --> 01:36:29,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Together. That's how we win.</font>

1153
01:36:29,825 --> 01:36:34,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we make our stand here
on the field of battle.</font>

1154
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:35,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a team.</font>

1155
01:36:35,831 --> 01:36:37,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is it.</font>

1156
01:36:38,709 --> 01:36:41,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is our moment.</font>

1157
01:36:43,422 --> 01:36:44,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time to fight.</font>

1158
01:36:52,431 --> 01:36:55,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bad time to say this,
but I don't actually have a plan.</font>

1159
01:36:56,852 --> 01:36:58,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tails, any ideas?</font>

1160
01:36:58,770 --> 01:37:00,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to find his weak spot.</font>

1161
01:37:00,522 --> 01:37:02,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suggest the groin.</font>

1162
01:37:02,232 --> 01:37:04,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? No. No!</font>

1163
01:37:04,401 --> 01:37:06,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Traditionally, yes,
the groin is the weakest spot.</font>

1164
01:37:07,070 --> 01:37:09,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop saying "groin."</font>

1165
01:37:09,197 --> 01:37:10,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hedgehog!</font>

1166
01:37:11,074 --> 01:37:12,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look out!</font>

1167
01:37:15,203 --> 01:37:17,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what his weak spot is. It's me.</font>

1168
01:37:17,789 --> 01:37:19,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the groin!</font>

1169
01:37:22,169 --> 01:37:25,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think about it.
I live rent-free in this dude's head.</font>

1170
01:37:25,213 --> 01:37:27,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So if I go out there and rile him up...</font>

1171
01:37:27,132 --> 01:37:29,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'll focus on only you,
leaving himself open</font>

1172
01:37:29,634 --> 01:37:31,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to a flanking maneuver
from me and the fox!</font>

1173
01:37:31,970 --> 01:37:34,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hedgehog,
you are a brave and noble warrior.</font>

1174
01:37:34,806 --> 01:37:37,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go to your certain death with honor.</font>

1175
01:37:37,559 --> 01:37:40,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna have to work
on your pep talks, pal.</font>

1176
01:37:40,187 --> 01:37:41,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Let's go.</font>

1177
01:37:45,692 --> 01:37:47,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, mustache.</font>

1178
01:37:47,402 --> 01:37:50,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want me? Come and get me.</font>

1179
01:37:50,322 --> 01:37:53,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't tell me
about coming and getting.</font>

1180
01:37:53,158 --> 01:37:55,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am on the cutting edge
of coming and getting!</font>

1181
01:37:55,619 --> 01:37:57,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coming, getting.</font>

1182
01:37:57,621 --> 01:38:01,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coming, getting.
Coming, getting. Coming, getting.</font>

1183
01:38:04,378 --> 01:38:06,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're really heavy.</font>

1184
01:38:06,546 --> 01:38:10,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's because I am
one million percent muscle. Faster, fox!</font>

1185
01:38:12,594 --> 01:38:15,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Go! Move, guys! Move back!
- Let's go, that's it! Go, go, go!</font>

1186
01:38:15,847 --> 01:38:16,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Keep going!
- Go! Go!</font>

1187
01:38:16,973 --> 01:38:18,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, no! Stop!
- Stop the truck!</font>

1188
01:38:18,934 --> 01:38:20,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tom, what happened here?</font>

1189
01:38:21,269 --> 01:38:23,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Let's get our kid.</font>

1190
01:38:23,271 --> 01:38:24,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need your truck!</font>

1191
01:38:30,862 --> 01:38:33,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coming, getting.</font>

1192
01:38:34,074 --> 01:38:36,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yoo-hoo!</font>

1193
01:38:36,159 --> 01:38:38,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what's the plan here?</font>

1194
01:38:38,662 --> 01:38:43,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gonna build a big robot house?
Get yourself a big robot wife?</font>

1195
01:38:43,125 --> 01:38:47,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to enslave humanity
and force them to service my machines.</font>

1196
01:38:47,546 --> 01:38:50,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First, Green Hills. Then the universe.</font>

1197
01:38:50,465 --> 01:38:51,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then the multiverse.</font>

1198
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:54,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then who knows? Maybe that'll be enough.</font>

1199
01:38:55,178 --> 01:38:56,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Full disclosure?</font>

1200
01:38:57,347 --> 01:38:59,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You won't be there.</font>

1201
01:39:04,479 --> 01:39:06,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eye lasers? Really?</font>

1202
01:39:19,077 --> 01:39:21,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Snot rocket!</font>

1203
01:39:22,622 --> 01:39:23,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no!</font>

1204
01:39:32,174 --> 01:39:33,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Giving up already?</font>

1205
01:39:33,758 --> 01:39:37,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not so tough when you're fighting someone
700 times your size, are ya?</font>

1206
01:39:39,598 --> 01:39:42,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't beat me!</font>

1207
01:39:42,142 --> 01:39:45,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm all-powerful! All-knowing!</font>

1208
01:39:48,064 --> 01:39:50,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All-seeing.</font>

1209
01:39:51,401 --> 01:39:53,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like your fancy robot has a glitch.</font>

1210
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:57,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it me? What about me? I'm over here.
Up top! Down below! Behind you!</font>

1211
01:39:58,074 --> 01:39:59,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm over here. Sorry! Over here.</font>

1212
01:40:00,619 --> 01:40:01,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too slow! Try again.</font>

1213
01:40:01,912 --> 01:40:03,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You can't outsmart me.
- Missed me again.</font>

1214
01:40:04,039 --> 01:40:05,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the out smarter-er!</font>

1215
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:13,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't outsmart you.
I'm just the distraction.</font>

1216
01:40:13,215 --> 01:40:14,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Robotnik!</font>

1217
01:40:15,133 --> 01:40:17,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am also a hologram.</font>

1218
01:40:17,969 --> 01:40:19,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Disloyal.</font>

1219
01:40:19,971 --> 01:40:22,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Dis" is how I roll.</font>

1220
01:40:51,211 --> 01:40:52,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's my Emerald?</font>

1221
01:40:53,505 --> 01:40:55,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, no!</font>

1222
01:40:55,465 --> 01:40:57,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Computer, auxiliary power.</font>

1223
01:41:07,143 --> 01:41:09,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Emerald. It's right there.</font>

1224
01:41:09,938 --> 01:41:11,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move, you hunk of junk!</font>

1225
01:41:16,403 --> 01:41:19,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to... reach it.</font>

1226
01:41:43,013 --> 01:41:44,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1227
01:41:46,182 --> 01:41:48,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There he is! Go! Go, go, go!</font>

1228
01:41:57,277 --> 01:41:58,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1229
01:41:58,403 --> 01:41:59,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got you, Sonic.</font>

1230
01:42:00,905 --> 01:42:02,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on!</font>

1231
01:42:15,545 --> 01:42:17,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You guys okay?
- Yeah.</font>

1232
01:42:19,299 --> 01:42:20,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1233
01:42:25,889 --> 01:42:27,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got the Emerald.
We could still defeat him.</font>

1234
01:42:28,016 --> 01:42:31,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on.
How does this thing work? What do I do?</font>

1235
01:42:32,395 --> 01:42:33,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1236
01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:36,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, no, no!</font>

1237
01:42:40,820 --> 01:42:44,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at the happy little family.</font>

1238
01:42:50,872 --> 01:42:53,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to get away from me.
I'm the one he wants.</font>

1239
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:54,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1240
01:42:54,959 --> 01:42:56,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not going anywhere.</font>

1241
01:42:57,170 --> 01:42:58,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're family.</font>

1242
01:43:01,925 --> 01:43:03,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And families stick together...</font>

1243
01:43:06,471 --> 01:43:07,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">no matter what.</font>

1244
01:43:10,809 --> 01:43:11,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you guys.</font>

1245
01:43:12,852 --> 01:43:14,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We love you too, Sonic.</font>

1246
01:43:22,904 --> 01:43:24,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1247
01:43:26,408 --> 01:43:28,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got him!</font>

1248
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:32,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I finally got him!</font>

1249
01:43:37,711 --> 01:43:39,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that?</font>

1250
01:44:25,341 --> 01:44:27,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's over, Eggman.</font>

1251
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:31,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like the new look. It works for you.</font>

1252
01:44:32,223 --> 01:44:35,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you say
we just let bygones be bygones?</font>

1253
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:39,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did some things, you did some things.
There are good people on both sides.</font>

1254
01:44:40,774 --> 01:44:43,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surely two intelligent beings</font>

1255
01:44:45,612 --> 01:44:47,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">can work these things out!</font>

1256
01:44:59,626 --> 01:45:02,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on, buddy. Come on.
- Get him, Sonic!</font>

1257
01:45:02,170 --> 01:45:03,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Come on.</font>

1258
01:45:20,063 --> 01:45:21,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like that?</font>

1259
01:45:23,024 --> 01:45:25,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, we're not friends.</font>

1260
01:45:29,739 --> 01:45:32,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Later, hater!</font>

1261
01:45:43,419 --> 01:45:44,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sonic!
- Buddy!</font>

1262
01:45:45,463 --> 01:45:47,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait! You cannot touch him!</font>

1263
01:45:47,590 --> 01:45:50,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The hedgehog holds
the power of the Emerald.</font>

1264
01:45:50,969 --> 01:45:54,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am sorry.
He is no longer the Sonic you once knew.</font>

1265
01:45:55,139 --> 01:45:56,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1266
01:46:16,077 --> 01:46:17,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got to try this.</font>

1267
01:46:23,459 --> 01:46:26,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.
He is exactly the Sonic you once knew.</font>

1268
01:46:28,673 --> 01:46:30,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.</font>

1269
01:46:38,516 --> 01:46:39,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic!</font>

1270
01:46:41,895 --> 01:46:43,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring it in, bud.</font>

1271
01:46:44,939 --> 01:46:46,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's good to be back in blue.</font>

1272
01:46:46,983 --> 01:46:50,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The golden god thing was fun,
but blue has always been more my color.</font>

1273
01:46:50,403 --> 01:46:51,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks good on you.</font>

1274
01:46:51,571 --> 01:46:56,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic, you were the most powerful hero
in the universe, and you let it go.</font>

1275
01:46:57,076 --> 01:46:58,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

1276
01:46:59,913 --> 01:47:03,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I still have
some growing up to do.</font>

1277
01:47:05,293 --> 01:47:09,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And I kind of like being a kid.
- And you're not just any kid.</font>

1278
01:47:09,631 --> 01:47:11,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're our kid.</font>

1279
01:47:11,591 --> 01:47:13,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

1280
01:47:13,092 --> 01:47:15,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bring it in!
- Yay. Hugs.</font>

1281
01:47:15,887 --> 01:47:18,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a good thing we didn't do this
before. You would've blown up.</font>

1282
01:47:26,356 --> 01:47:27,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You fixed it.</font>

1283
01:47:28,024 --> 01:47:31,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've spent my whole life
questing for this.</font>

1284
01:47:31,444 --> 01:47:32,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I have it.</font>

1285
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:34,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now we have it.</font>

1286
01:47:34,697 --> 01:47:37,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do we do with it? What next?</font>

1287
01:47:37,367 --> 01:47:39,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There were once two orders of heroes</font>

1288
01:47:39,577 --> 01:47:43,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who protected the galaxy from those
who would use the Emerald for evil.</font>

1289
01:47:43,790 --> 01:47:47,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But they have all passed on
to the great battleground in the sky.</font>

1290
01:47:47,752 --> 01:47:51,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we start a new order. The three of us.</font>

1291
01:47:51,297 --> 01:47:53,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is no light task.</font>

1292
01:47:53,091 --> 01:47:57,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We must make a vow to use our powers
to keep the universe safe,</font>

1293
01:47:58,554 --> 01:48:00,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to watch out for each other.</font>

1294
01:48:00,473 --> 01:48:02,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our new tribe.</font>

1295
01:48:02,266 --> 01:48:03,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know!</font>

1296
01:48:03,476 --> 01:48:05,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- A power bump!
- Good idea.</font>

1297
01:48:06,938 --> 01:48:10,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an Earth custom.
An unbreakable promise.</font>

1298
01:48:10,733 --> 01:48:12,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very well.</font>

1299
01:48:12,819 --> 01:48:15,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A power bump it is.</font>

1300
01:48:16,406 --> 01:48:18,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Power bump!</font>

1301
01:48:21,995 --> 01:48:26,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's truly a beautiful day for baseball
here in Green Hills.</font>

1302
01:48:26,207 --> 01:48:27,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An exciting lineup today</font>

1303
01:48:28,001 --> 01:48:31,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the debut appearance
of two new players!</font>

1304
01:48:31,379 --> 01:48:35,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the mound,
rookie sensation from across the galaxy,</font>

1305
01:48:35,633 --> 01:48:38,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles "Tails" Prower,</font>

1306
01:48:38,261 --> 01:48:42,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">facing off against the powerhouse,
Knuckles the Echidna.</font>

1307
01:48:44,434 --> 01:48:46,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand.</font>

1308
01:48:46,394 --> 01:48:48,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why am I angry at the enemy ball?</font>

1309
01:48:48,646 --> 01:48:49,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not angry.</font>

1310
01:48:49,897 --> 01:48:53,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just want to hit it as hard as you can
and then run around the bases.</font>

1311
01:48:53,234 --> 01:48:57,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if my quest ends where I am standing,
why run at all?</font>

1312
01:48:58,531 --> 01:49:01,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't with this guy. Why do I even try?</font>

1313
01:49:01,159 --> 01:49:03,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is just a game.
We're out here having fun.</font>

1314
01:49:03,911 --> 01:49:05,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just having some fun.</font>

1315
01:49:05,496 --> 01:49:06,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fun.</font>

1316
01:49:08,124 --> 01:49:10,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right! Give him the heat, Tails!</font>

1317
01:49:10,585 --> 01:49:12,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope you're ready for my fastball.</font>

1318
01:49:12,587 --> 01:49:15,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your fastball will be dishonored.</font>

1319
01:49:15,131 --> 01:49:17,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And so will you, fox.</font>

1320
01:49:17,467 --> 01:49:19,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Easy, guys!
- Don't think about it too much.</font>

1321
01:49:19,927 --> 01:49:23,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just keep your elbow up,
eye on the ball and give it a ride.</font>

1322
01:49:23,431 --> 01:49:24,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A ride? To where?</font>

1323
01:49:29,103 --> 01:49:30,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Power bump!</font>

1324
01:49:35,693 --> 01:49:37,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Victory is mine!</font>

1325
01:49:37,236 --> 01:49:39,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, no fair! That shouldn't count.</font>

1326
01:49:39,864 --> 01:49:42,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First base is also mine!</font>

1327
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:46,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I think that was our only ball.
- I have conquered the second of the bases!</font>

1328
01:49:46,871 --> 01:49:48,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who wants ice cream?</font>

1329
01:49:48,498 --> 01:49:49,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Knocked the cover off that.</font>

1330
01:49:49,791 --> 01:49:51,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ice cream!
- Ice cream, yeah!</font>

1331
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:56,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am having the fun! What is ice cream?</font>

1332
01:49:56,506 --> 01:49:59,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a dessert.
If you like fun, you're gonna love it.</font>

1333
01:49:59,926 --> 01:50:03,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yum. Dessert. Does it have grapes in it?</font>

1334
01:50:03,179 --> 01:50:04,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, not usually.</font>

1335
01:50:04,847 --> 01:50:06,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm proud of our little guy.</font>

1336
01:50:07,391 --> 01:50:10,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really like his new friends,
especially the red one.</font>

1337
01:50:10,937 --> 01:50:13,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He cracks me up.
- Heck of a swing too.</font>

1338
01:50:13,648 --> 01:50:16,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, fox.
Our dessert adventure awaits.</font>

1339
01:50:16,484 --> 01:50:17,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good job, guys.
- Yeah.</font>

1340
01:50:17,902 --> 01:50:21,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You too, baby. Let's go get
some ice cream. Come on, come on.</font>

1341
01:50:22,365 --> 01:50:24,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm happy for you, pal.</font>

1342
01:50:24,617 --> 01:50:27,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got your wing men.
Perfect friends to grow up with.</font>

1343
01:50:27,870 --> 01:50:31,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on, Knuckles.
- My victory chariot!</font>

1344
01:50:33,209 --> 01:50:36,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got a lot more than that... Dad.</font>

1345
01:50:41,634 --> 01:50:42,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Race you to the truck.</font>

1346
01:50:44,637 --> 01:50:46,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One, two, three, go!</font>

1347
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:48,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, don't go easy on me. I want your best.</font>

1348
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:51,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonic, I have just been told
they have sprinkles.</font>

1349
01:50:51,894 --> 01:50:55,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ice cream and sprinkles?
This is your new destiny.</font>

1350
01:50:55,648 --> 01:51:00,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a perfect meal to celebrate
my victory over you in base of ball.</font>

1351
01:51:00,653 --> 01:51:03,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- I mean, you barely beat me.</font>

1352
01:51:03,948 --> 01:51:06,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've never been beaten so hard.</font>

1353
01:51:10,872 --> 01:51:12,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't forget this.</font>

1354
01:53:11,409 --> 01:53:13,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Agent, I want an update.</font>

1355
01:53:13,369 --> 01:53:16,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still searching, sir.
We haven't found any sign of Robotnik.</font>

1356
01:53:16,372 --> 01:53:18,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one could've survived that crash.</font>

1357
01:53:18,791 --> 01:53:21,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's toast. Good riddance.</font>

1358
01:53:21,961 --> 01:53:24,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a mess that lunatic made.</font>

1359
01:53:25,298 --> 01:53:28,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, there's something else.</font>

1360
01:53:28,718 --> 01:53:32,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When we were wiping Robotnik
off our database, we found something.</font>

1361
01:53:32,305 --> 01:53:36,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A file buried deep in our system
and dating back over 50 years.</font>

1362
01:53:36,142 --> 01:53:39,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What was it?
- Coordinates, sir.</font>

1363
01:53:39,145 --> 01:53:41,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coordinates? To what?</font>

1364
01:53:41,772 --> 01:53:43,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A secret research facility.</font>

1365
01:53:44,358 --> 01:53:45,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a black site, sir.</font>

1366
01:53:46,694 --> 01:53:49,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone worked very hard
to keep this hidden.</font>

1367
01:53:50,531 --> 01:53:51,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My God.</font>

1368
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:54,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Project Shadow.</font>
