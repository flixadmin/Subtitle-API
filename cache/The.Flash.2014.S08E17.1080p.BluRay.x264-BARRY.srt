1
00:00:04,255 --> 00:00:05,357
<i>What do we got, Chester?</i>

2
00:00:05,381 --> 00:00:07,425
Multiple fire alarms
at Ivo Labs.

3
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:08,652
You know, hopefully, it's not

4
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:12,514
an overcooked-chicken-tenders
in-the-microwave situation.

5
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:14,474
<i>I said
I was sorry for that.</i>

6
00:00:14,557 --> 00:00:17,143
Roger that. Yeah, yeah.
It's just, you know, man...

7
00:00:17,268 --> 00:00:20,271
<i>...that smell took us forever
to get out of the lounge.</i>

8
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:21,564
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

9
00:00:22,357 --> 00:00:23,483
Fire's already been put out.

10
00:00:24,234 --> 00:00:25,610
Flash, you're back.

11
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:28,238
I just got here.

12
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:30,615
No, you didn't.
You sped us out of the way

13
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,384
and then put out the fire
with a wind funnel.

14
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:33,868
Like you did with The Hotness.

15
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:35,244
I did?

16
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,372
If it wasn't for your super-speed,

17
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:41,084
seven years of research would have
gone up in smoke. Literally.

18
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:42,835
Yeah, you're welcome.

19
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:45,588
Hey, Flash, what's goin' on?
What are they talkin' about?

20
00:00:45,672 --> 00:00:47,131
I don't know.

21
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:52,011
I think there may be
a new speedster in town.

22
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:13,616
A new speedster? You sure?

23
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,910
Those Ivo employees said
someone ran them to safety

24
00:01:15,994 --> 00:01:18,746
and then used a wind funnel
to put the fire out, just like I would.

25
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,790
Well, that sure sounds like a speedster.

26
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,042
Do you have any leads on
to who it might be?

27
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:26,588
Not yet. August Heart's still
locked up at Iron Heights.

28
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:29,108
Thawne doesn't have his speed,
he's under heavy guard at A.R.G.U.S.

29
00:01:29,132 --> 00:01:32,385
And all the Velocity-X vials
are secure at S.T.A.R. Labs.

30
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:34,387
And I still can't reach
Speed Force Nora.

31
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,097
Or any of the other Forces.

32
00:01:39,392 --> 00:01:40,392
Is there more?

33
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:46,274
Just... Caitlin still hasn't
returned my calls

34
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:49,068
since I stopped her experiment
to resurrect Frost.

35
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:51,195
You did more than stop it.

36
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:57,952
I'm not saying it's wrong,
but Caitlin lost

37
00:01:58,036 --> 00:02:00,246
the most important person
in the world to her,

38
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,499
and she could lose something
just as important.

39
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:05,792
Hope.

40
00:02:07,587 --> 00:02:09,339
We are gonna be late.

41
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:11,382
- Oh! Hey.
- Hey.

42
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:14,886
We've got kindergarten interviews
for Jenna at every school all day.

43
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,347
The competition is crazy fierce.

44
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,058
Um... Oh! Great,
you've got Jenna's backpack.

45
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:22,393
I have the paperwork,
I have the interview questions.

46
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:25,104
You and I, we are gonna
go over that in the car. Um...

47
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:28,065
What are we missing?

48
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,900
Jenna?

49
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:35,905
Hey.

50
00:02:35,907 --> 00:02:38,177
I need your notes on the profile feature
for Judge Hankerson's retirement.

51
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:39,285
Already in your inbox.

52
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:41,680
And here's the briefing I wrote up
for your next field piece.

53
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:44,499
They're closing Fort Delaney?
That's right up my alley.

54
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:46,334
Allegra, did you sign off on my...

55
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,145
Expense reports?
Yep, they're with accounting.

56
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,754
- Okay, then.
- Allegra,

57
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,924
I want to run an exposé on
the light meta who works with the Flash.

58
00:02:58,346 --> 00:03:00,848
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

59
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:03,935
I've been pulling pictures.

60
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,913
Whoever this is,
her face is always hidden by light,

61
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:09,107
but I think I could ID her
with enough resources.

62
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:10,983
Maybe she doesn't want to be ID'd.

63
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,069
Well, we don't know that.

64
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:15,780
And a new hero in town is big news.

65
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,241
- That's why we should run this.
- No.

66
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:22,370
I mean, it's not right for CCC Media.

67
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:24,706
Says the temporary editor-in-chief.

68
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:27,083
I already ran the story by Iris
before she left.

69
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:29,001
What did she say?

70
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:31,212
That it was an interesting angle

71
00:03:31,796 --> 00:03:33,464
and she would strongly consider it.

72
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:36,426
Well, maybe we hold off
on moving forward with it

73
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:37,509
until she's back.

74
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:49,355
I don't get it.

75
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,025
I thought you left the Arañas after you
were paroled from Iron Heights.

76
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:54,109
I did.

77
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:56,204
But our old gang's trying
to pull me back in.

78
00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:58,823
The Arañas are expanding.

79
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:01,534
They've taken over
every square inch of Keystone,

80
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:02,994
and now they want Central City.

81
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,371
The gang's been dropping bodies.

82
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:07,164
What?

83
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:09,959
The Arañas aren't killers.
We used to just steal cars.

84
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,335
Not anymore.

85
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:14,881
Thanks to new leadership,
there's no line they won't cross.

86
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:16,924
Who are these people?

87
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:18,801
The kind you don't want to mess with.

88
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:20,344
Look...

89
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:25,266
You did me a huge favor
when you wrote that article about me.

90
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:29,771
And because of you, I was able to
make a new, better life in this city.

91
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:31,606
And I don't want to give that up.

92
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:35,234
But I have to leave.

93
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:39,572
Because the same reason

94
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:41,699
they want me to run things

95
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,827
is the reason
I won't survive if I turn them down.

96
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:47,455
Lydia, if what you're saying is true,

97
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,708
we have to stop them
before anyone else gets killed.

98
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:51,793
We can't.

99
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:55,755
What if you help
CCC Media break this story?

100
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:58,508
Like you said,
you know everything about them.

101
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:02,470
Where they keep their money,
their contacts, their stash houses.

102
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,014
Lydia,

103
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:07,767
you're the only one
that can help me take them down.

104
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,895
No way. You know what they'd do to me
for snitching?

105
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:14,357
CCC Media will treat you
as an anonymous source.

106
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:15,899
We'll protect you.

107
00:05:16,943 --> 00:05:17,943
How?

108
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:20,988
I know someone who can
run you out of town quick

109
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:22,198
if something goes south.

110
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:24,616
Look...

111
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:26,327
I know you're scared,

112
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:28,913
but the Arañas,

113
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:30,998
they operate in the shadows.

114
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,126
The only way to take away their power

115
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,087
is bring them into the light.

116
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:41,509
Think about
all the other girls in the gangs.

117
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,762
The ones who are trying to get out,
but they can't.

118
00:05:45,263 --> 00:05:46,764
Telling your story

119
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,892
could help them
get their lives back, too.

120
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:52,603
Okay.

121
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,274
But not here.

122
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:01,195
And after our interview,
I'm on the first bus out of here.

123
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,596
We'll keep you safe, I promise.

124
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:10,495
I found Lydia.

125
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:13,583
Looks like she's skipping town.

126
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,918
That's not all she's doing.

127
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,210
Rawlins,

128
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:20,381
Lydia's talking to Esperanza's cousin,
the reporter.

129
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:22,925
We can't let them expose us.

130
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:25,427
They won't.

131
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:29,140
No one defies the Arañas and survives.

132
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:42,945
So, I've been checking S.T.A.R Labs'
satellite readings all day.

133
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:44,906
Not a stray tachyon to be found.

134
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:47,533
Our new speedster
isn't using the Speed Force.

135
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:48,737
And now they're in the wind.

136
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:51,494
What's wrong?

137
00:06:51,913 --> 00:06:53,456
The fire's origin is here,

138
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,934
but the only thing that
could have started it is this acetone.

139
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,752
Even with an incredibly low flash point,

140
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,629
it would still need an ignition source.

141
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:02,840
Chester, what if this speedster

142
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,550
was the combustion force?

143
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:07,470
Oh, snap. Yeah, no.
The friction from their super-speed

144
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:10,473
would totally be enough
to kick-start a reaction.

145
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:12,975
And it would explain how they arrived
on scene before you.

146
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:14,477
Because they started it.

147
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:16,311
But why?

148
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:20,441
Look at this biometric lock.

149
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:26,697
It's broken.

150
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:34,538
And whatever was inside is MIA,
just like our speedster.

151
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:36,457
But, man,

152
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:38,334
the only reason you would need

153
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,187
a temperature-controlled polymer case
like this

154
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:43,798
would be to hold
a very strong electrochemical cell.

155
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:46,676
Like Ivo Labs' Newton battery.

156
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:49,762
It's experimental,
but it's incredibly powerful.

157
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,431
What if the fire was a distraction
so they could steal this?

158
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:54,517
Damn.

159
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,937
Yeah, okay, I guess we can scratch them
off the nice speedster list.

160
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,188
What do we do now?

161
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:01,148
We get answers from the one person

162
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:03,526
who knows villainous speedsters
better than I do.

163
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:07,381
Which means I'm gonna be off the grid,
so Team Flash is on its own for a while.

164
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:08,656
You're gonna go see him?

165
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:10,985
You sure that's a good idea?

166
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,493
I have to know if it's him.

167
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:16,789
Okay. Yeah, you do you.
We'll be fine here.

168
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:35,725
This is the Arañas gang.

169
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:38,769
For years, their M.O. was stealing cars.

170
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:41,772
It was founded by a teenager in Keystone

171
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:45,943
who later became known
as the meta-human Ultraviolet.

172
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:47,611
Now, more recently,

173
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:52,283
UV has worked alongside Millie Rawlins
and Dr. Kimiyo Hoshi,

174
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,827
aka Sunshine and Dr. Light.

175
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:57,163
Collectively known
as "The Assassins Three,"

176
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,832
they've worked for Black Hole
and Eva McCulloch.

177
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,960
Only, according to rumors,

178
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:04,462
Ultraviolet died last year.

179
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:06,046
And why should we care?

180
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,382
Because I just found out

181
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:11,135
Sunshine and Dr. Light
are now running the Arañas.

182
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,430
We're talking extortion,
million-dollar thefts

183
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,182
that should be impossible,

184
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:20,311
and they're leaving a trail of bodies
made from anyone who gets in their way.

185
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,354
And you got all this from one source?

186
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,982
Is there anyone else
who can corroborate her story?

187
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:26,776
She is all we need.

188
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:30,196
Which is why we're doing
a live interview with her.

189
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,237
Tonight.

190
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,635
I mean, you can't be serious. We'd have
no time to fact-check her story.

191
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,162
And this source,
how do you even know she's reliable?

192
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,831
- I just do.
- I don't get it.

193
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,459
Why are you so passionate
about this story?

194
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:48,130
Look, I know this sounds crazy,

195
00:09:48,214 --> 00:09:51,217
but I am telling you
it's the right move.

196
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,719
You just have to trust
that I know what I'm doing.

197
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,766
I'll, uh... I'll go call my babysitter.

198
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:00,684
I'll DVR the Sharks game.

199
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:09,527
Okay, let's do this.

200
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:11,779
Chester, meet Lydia.

201
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,446
Hi.

202
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,807
We've got a skeleton staff tonight,
to protect her identity.

203
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:18,869
And Lydia, don't worry,
I trust Chuck with my life.

204
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:21,038
Uh, what do you do around here?

205
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:23,582
Tonight I'll be running
an AI-generated filter

206
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,043
to conceal your voice and face
during the interview,

207
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:27,419
so, no worries.

208
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:29,383
Not even your mom
will recognize you.

209
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:32,382
I need some water.

210
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,888
Is, uh, she gonna be okay?

211
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,305
Yeah.

212
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:41,349
What about you?

213
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:42,810
Yeah.

214
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:46,647
'Cause reporting on the Arañas,
I know that's a big deal for you.

215
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:49,789
How did your staff react when
you told them about your connection?

216
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:51,986
I... I didn't tell them.

217
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,864
Allegra, are you sure
that's the right move?

218
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:57,658
I need them to trust me.

219
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,578
And if I tell them
I was in the Arañas...

220
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:04,999
No, I can't risk them
losing faith in me.

221
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,584
This story is too important.

222
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,961
I'm gonna go check on Lydia.

223
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:18,137
My stomach is doing flip-flops.

224
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:20,806
You're scared. I get it.

225
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:25,686
But the risk we're taking,
it's worth it.

226
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,857
Think about your life
before you joined the Arañas.

227
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:36,155
Hmm. It was rough.

228
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,076
I was on my own,

229
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:43,537
struggling to get by.

230
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,458
Always wishing to be
a part of something, a family.

231
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,586
And what I didn't know
was that it could get even worse.

232
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:06,449
Yeah, but somehow
you got out without getting killed.

233
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:07,519
I might not get so lucky.

234
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:11,659
- What's happening?
- Get down.

235
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,250
The Arañas.
I knew they'd find me.

236
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,918
Okay, we have to get out of here, now.

237
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:38,926
Hello, Lydia.

238
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:44,889
Come on.

239
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:54,691
Sorry, ladies.

240
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:58,570
It's the end of the road.

241
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:15,795
Quick, in here!

242
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,814
You can't keep me out forever.

243
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:36,358
Who the hell was that?

244
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,528
The Arañas are here. We're under attack.
She's hurt.

245
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:40,862
I'm on it.

246
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:43,240
This can't be happening.

247
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:44,825
We need to get to a secure location.

248
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:46,484
We're in one. I just activated

249
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,346
a photo-kinetic energy shield
around the whole building.

250
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,582
It's bulletproof, teleport-proof,
basically everything-proof.

251
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,501
How'd you know to do that?
You're just an IT guy.

252
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,756
Back when we were <i>The Citizen,</i>

253
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,841
Dr. Light attacked us.

254
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:03,164
That's when Sue Dearbon
hired him to secure the building.

255
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:04,553
Why isn't my phone working?

256
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,723
They must be using a signal jammer
to block communications.

257
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,225
- Frick.
- What is it?

258
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:13,479
My force field was only meant
to be a temporary shield

259
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:14,847
until we could call for help.

260
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,273
And now we can't.

261
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:18,442
Guys, she's back.

262
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,028
I've been in combat.

263
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,199
Knowing where your enemy is
is a good thing.

264
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,783
Now we need a plan.

265
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,327
Chuck, can you
MacGyver something together

266
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,537
to bust through their cell jammers
and call for help?

267
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,832
I can build an oscillating transmitter
to bypass their signals.

268
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,836
Sunshine just flipping disappeared!

269
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,673
Yeah, okay. We need to just remain calm.

270
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:43,550
Until this force field goes critical,

271
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:47,471
Hoshi can't fire her photon bullets,
and Sunshine can't teleport in.

272
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,306
How do you know so much about them?

273
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:51,517
Yeah, Allegra, how do you?

274
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:57,855
Oh, my God.

275
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,016
We need to talk, Thawne.

276
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,085
You took my speed.

277
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:22,214
What more do you want?
My body is broken.

278
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:25,259
I can barely think, I can't sleep.

279
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,512
I used to be able
to run around the world

280
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:32,141
in five seconds.
Now it takes me at least that long

281
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:35,686
to cross this stupid cell because...

282
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:40,566
you took my speed.

283
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,068
You did this to yourself, Thawne.

284
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:45,571
Armageddon was your plan.

285
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,239
And it should've worked.

286
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:49,907
But...

287
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,786
it didn't. And now...

288
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,124
I'll have to find a new way to kill you.

289
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:00,836
Well, you can try.

290
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,589
I've gotten what I need.

291
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:07,217
Wait, you're out?
Wait, you're leaving me

292
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,136
just like that?

293
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,679
No...

294
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:15,142
parting gift? No 411

295
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,852
on your precious

296
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:18,937
"Team Flash"?

297
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:21,398
And by the way...

298
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:25,986
it's just

299
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:28,363
too bad

300
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,700
what happened to Frost, isn't it?

301
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,328
Then again...

302
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:39,583
she was in over her head
from the beginning, wasn't she?

303
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,627
Yeah, this was a waste of time.

304
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,462
Wait, Allen, don't go.

305
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:45,756
Come on.

306
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:51,637
That's no way to treat an old friend.
What do you want, huh?

307
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:55,182
To see if you were responsible
for something impossible.

308
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:56,433
And now I know

309
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:58,476
you couldn't be.

310
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:01,438
Responsible for what?

311
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:04,857
What is it?

312
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:09,404
What scared you so bad
that you had to run all this way

313
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:12,074
just to be sure I was still here?

314
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,035
I found a new speedster.

315
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:19,789
Huh.

316
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,878
They can't have Lydia,
so we stick to the plan.

317
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:26,356
Chuck's working on the transmitter.

318
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,215
And what if they get in here
before he's done?

319
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:30,050
They threatened to kill us.

320
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,094
She's right. They're an invading force.

321
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:33,803
We need a plan B.

322
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:37,516
What, you're already
working on page one?

323
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:42,187
I'm writing a letter to my kids
in case I die in here, okay?

324
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:53,155
I give up!

325
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,242
- You hear me? I surrender!
- Lydia. Lydia, stop.

326
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,077
You can't give yourself up.

327
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:58,744
You...

328
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:01,498
Open the doors.

329
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:03,667
What? No. Lydia, they'll kill you.

330
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,002
They're gonna anyways.

331
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:07,597
Now open the door
so no one else has to die.

332
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:08,879
Good call.

333
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,218
Lydia, look,

334
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:16,179
I get what you're trying to do,
and it is damn selfless.

335
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:18,974
But there's got to be another way, okay?

336
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:21,160
Don't forget why you came here.
You came here to stop them.

337
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:23,645
I came here
so no one else would get killed.

338
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:24,896
Now let me out!

339
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,383
Hey, if she wants to go, let her.

340
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:27,691
No way!

341
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,698
We can't send someone
out there to die, Taylor.

342
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,380
So what? We're just gonna sit here
instead and wait for them to fry us

343
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:34,531
or shoot us
or whatever the hell it is they do?

344
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:36,908
Open the damn doors.

345
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:39,578
Lydia, I'm the only one
with the code to that shield.

346
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,541
And there's no way in hell
I'm giving it to you.

347
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,123
Which means

348
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,377
we're gonna help you survive this. Okay?

349
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:51,548
You ain't never getting in.

350
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:53,884
Now I'm mad.

351
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:01,016
Wait, wait, wait. Let me take this.

352
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,395
You people are
just as crazy as the Arañas.

353
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,230
We promised to keep her safe.

354
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:09,691
- You did. I didn't.
- Okay.

355
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,860
We all just need to take a step back

356
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:14,571
and figure out a new way out of this,

357
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,949
'cause that woman's life
depends on our next move.

358
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:19,368
And what about our lives?

359
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,578
The Arañas want Lydia, not us.

360
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,164
We turn her over, they'll let us go.
I like that plan.

361
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:26,458
No, it doesn't matter what we do,

362
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,251
they will not let us go. Not now.

363
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:29,335
You don't know that.

364
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:33,465
Look, I saw
the code Chester typed in earlier.

365
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:37,094
And this is what Lydia wants.

366
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:40,514
Hey, Lydia is our source.

367
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:43,350
It is our duty as journalists
to protect her, no matter what,

368
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:44,434
even from herself.

369
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:47,104
An ethics lesson from you, really?

370
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,064
Your whole past is unethical.

371
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:51,983
What's she talking about?

372
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:54,611
The reason Allegra knows so much
about the Arañas.

373
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,048
They need to know
what you've been hiding.

374
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:58,072
Taylor, don't.

375
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:00,784
This is my life, my decision.

376
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:01,867
Too late.

377
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,206
Right before we were attacked,
I had a contact

378
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,409
take a look at some of Allegra's
sealed juvie records.

379
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,751
And guess what they found?

380
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:12,170
Our ex-con co-worker

381
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,756
was in a gang
with her cousin, Ultraviolet.

382
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:18,218
The same gang
that's been killing people in Keystone.

383
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,512
Allegra used to be one of them.

384
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,181
One of the Arañas.

385
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:25,432
Is this for real?

386
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:29,062
I am so sorry
that I didn't tell you the truth.

387
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,898
But we have to stick together,
we have to protect Lydia.

388
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:34,025
Stick together? You lied to us.

389
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,610
And now it's gonna get us killed.

390
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:38,280
She's right. We can't trust you.

391
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,506
Okay. Once I finish this transmitter,
we can get out of here, okay?

392
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:58,967
Why couldn't you
just let me go out there?

393
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:01,344
'Cause you came here
to do something important.

394
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,073
You and Allegra are trying to drag
a bunch of killers out of the darkness

395
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:07,100
and expose everything they're doing.
And you still can.

396
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,261
Why do you think
Hoshi and Rawlins are still out there?

397
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,064
Because they're scared of you, Lydia.

398
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:17,110
We need to get that emergency signal
out now, Chuck.

399
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,840
Look, I just need a little more time.

400
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:20,530
Well, we don't have it.

401
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:23,909
Taylor just told everyone that I was
in the Arañas, and now no one trusts me.

402
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,869
Plus, she memorized your shield code.

403
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,913
They are this close
to opening those doors.

404
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,003
I never should've taken over
after Iris left.

405
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:37,339
No, no, this isn't your fault.

406
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:38,673
Yes, it is.

407
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:43,136
I am not a leader. I never have been.

408
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:49,267
You know how Esperanza
and I ended up in juvie?

409
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:51,937
I had an idea for a job.

410
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:55,649
We were gonna hit
a bunch of semis at a rest stop.

411
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:57,317
It was my idea,

412
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,569
so Esperanza put me in charge
of the whole thing.

413
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,781
And I checked the trucks.

414
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:06,535
And when it came time,
I told the girls it was clear.

415
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:09,454
But I missed a driver,
and he had a shotgun,

416
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:12,165
and one of my girls got hit
with a round.

417
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,126
You know what was in that truck?

418
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:17,045
Lawn furniture.

419
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:21,174
Chuck, a girl almost died because of me.

420
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:28,181
I am not cut out to lead anyone.

421
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:33,144
All I'll do is get people hurt,
or worse.

422
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,187
That's not true.

423
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,199
Look, I was lost when you found me.

424
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:49,953
I wanted out of the Arañas so bad,

425
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:52,205
but I couldn't actually do it.

426
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,333
And then you wrote that article
about me.

427
00:22:58,003 --> 00:22:59,963
And seeing how you saw me,

428
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:02,090
as someone with a future,

429
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:04,843
it helped me reclaim my life.

430
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:09,890
And today, I was terrified,
but you inspired me to come here

431
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:12,642
because when you said
we could take down the Arañas,

432
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:14,144
I believed you.

433
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:16,645
I still do.

434
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:17,772
She's right.

435
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,234
You are a leader.

436
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:24,487
And not in spite of your past,
but because of it.

437
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:29,075
You're Allegra freakin' Garcia.

438
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:31,369
You always know who you are

439
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:33,413
and what you want to do.

440
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:35,332
But you can't lead

441
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,584
if you're trying to stay in the dark.

442
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,547
So, Allegra, what do you want to do?

443
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:52,933
They didn't leave behind
any tachyons after the fire.

444
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:55,786
Could you tell if they were

445
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,997
- tapping into the Negative Speed Force?
- How could I tell?

446
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:00,398
You severed my connection, remember?

447
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:03,109
But you time-traveled
before that. A lot.

448
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:06,071
Did you ever sense
another speedster in 2022?

449
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:07,822
Someone trying to hide their abilities?

450
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:10,283
Can you really not see
how obvious this answer is?

451
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:13,995
- Are you stupid?
- So enlighten me.

452
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:16,997
No.

453
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:26,548
Okay.

454
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:32,472
I get it.

455
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:35,725
You don't want to help me

456
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:39,145
because even after all this...

457
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:44,776
you're still jealous.

458
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,029
I'm not jealous of you.

459
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:51,533
- I pity you.
- I meant jealous of them.

460
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,702
- Who?
- This new speedster,

461
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:57,038
out there living a life you lost.

462
00:24:57,956 --> 00:24:59,332
While you can barely move,

463
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:01,459
their journey is just beginning.

464
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,545
Yours is already over.

465
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:09,175
What's it like
knowing you've been replaced?

466
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:14,097
I won't be replaced.

467
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:19,102
I will never be replaced,
because no speedster

468
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,730
is ever gonna feel for you what I do!

469
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:24,190
Hate. Hate.

470
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:26,276
Hate. Hate!

471
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:30,947
Pure and infinite hate. I...

472
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:34,409
hid in plain sight for years
to be next to you,

473
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,244
to be close to you, so I could hurt you.

474
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:39,330
I devoted my life
so I could destroy yours!

475
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:42,792
No speedster will ever replace me!

476
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,463
No speedster will ever feel

477
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:49,381
what I felt.

478
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:52,302
And because they don't,
this new speedster...

479
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,347
doesn't care about you at all.

480
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:57,807
And so,

481
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:02,270
there's another reason
they don't want to be found.

482
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:03,813
So what is it?

483
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:05,899
You really don't see it?

484
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:14,574
I guess I am faster than you after all.

485
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:15,784
Think about it, Allen.

486
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:19,996
A new speedster

487
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,415
running through the city streets...

488
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,086
with frightening new speed.

489
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:29,839
Just like you...

490
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,051
eight years ago.

491
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:36,930
They're hiding because
they can't control their abilities.

492
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:40,308
The fire was an accident.

493
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:55,448
Look, I wish there was another way,

494
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:58,827
but if we want to survive,
we have to give Lydia over now.

495
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:01,162
- No.
- Lydia is not going anywhere,

496
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:03,248
because I have a plan to get us all out.

497
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,209
But for it to work,
I need you to trust me.

498
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,544
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

499
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:09,629
Okay. We don't want to turn Lydia over,

500
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,422
- but Taylor is right.
- I know.

501
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:15,385
And the truth is, I was ashamed
of being in the Arañas.

502
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:18,721
And I was afraid if I told you
the truth about my past

503
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:20,098
that you would stop trusting me.

504
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:23,017
I thought there was too much at stake

505
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:26,104
for me to be honest
about who I really am.

506
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:33,987
But it was lying about my past
and keeping you in the dark

507
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,572
that lost your trust.

508
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:40,326
So, I'm done hiding.

509
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,337
I'm the light-meta in those photos.

510
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:56,467
And I've never really
told anyone that before.

511
00:27:56,843 --> 00:28:00,180
You're the one who's always helping
the Flash, the one saving people?

512
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:11,441
And right now, I'm going to save us.

513
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:14,527
All you have to do is trust me.

514
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:17,253
Look,
Allegra is the real deal.

515
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:19,949
If she says she has a plan, then I'm in.

516
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:22,493
All in.

517
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:24,579
Me, too.

518
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:27,956
So,

519
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,750
who's with me?

520
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:50,438
This is a photo-kinetic energy shield.

521
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:52,190
It'll take time to split the bonds.

522
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:54,067
Not if we have the right weapon.

523
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:56,568
Give me your ammo.

524
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:09,791
And now we do.

525
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:27,267
This is gonna be fun.

526
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:32,604
Where are they?

527
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,610
Easy, ladies.

528
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:42,949
We can all still walk out of here
without a sunburn.

529
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:45,994
We made you a real nice offer, Garcia.

530
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:48,371
Give up the girl and live.

531
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,832
Yeah. Then when you slink
back into the shadows,

532
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:54,502
every other body you drop
makes CCC Media responsible?

533
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:56,212
Not happening.

534
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:03,594
Hurry, she's buying us time.

535
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,764
Camera and sound are up.
How's the transmitter coming?

536
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,100
- I just need to reset the encoder.
- Well, reset faster.

537
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:10,744
If this crazy plan of hers
doesn't work...

538
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:13,563
It will. We just need to trust Allegra.

539
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:55,915
Nice trick.

540
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,084
But I can feel how hard it is

541
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,628
for you to maintain so much power.

542
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,717
Because you can't beat me, Garcia.

543
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:08,803
I'm not trying to.

544
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:12,807
<i>This is a Central City
Citizen Media Special Report.</i>

545
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:15,726
<i>We're here today
with a very brave young woman,</i>

546
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:18,163
<i>who's ready to come forward and talk</i>

547
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:20,231
<i>about the gang activity
in Keystone City.</i>

548
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:21,899
<i>Lydia Sanchez,</i>

549
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:24,652
can you tell us about
a group called the Arañas?

550
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:28,739
I have been living in fear

551
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:31,701
of the Arañas for a long time.

552
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,663
And even when I agreed
to do this interview,

553
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:38,666
I didn't want to show my face at first.

554
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:41,627
But now I realize

555
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:44,022
<i>they are the ones who should be afraid.</i>

556
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:47,633
<i>Because we're the ones
dragging them into the light.</i>

557
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,094
<i>So, to all the girls out there</i>

558
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:52,472
<i>struggling to break free
of their control,</i>

559
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:53,848
look at me.

560
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:56,766
I did it.

561
00:32:58,311 --> 00:32:59,395
So can you.

562
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:01,898
And who's running this gang?

563
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,610
<i>Their names are Millie Rawlins
and Kimiyo Hoshi.</i>

564
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:13,534
That interview is going out live
to millions of people across the city.

565
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:17,914
If either of you try
to go after Lydia again

566
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:20,041
or anyone on my staff,

567
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:22,710
the whole world will know it was you.

568
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:26,172
You can go now.

569
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:29,257
This isn't over.

570
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:31,385
Bring it on, bitch.

571
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:50,238
Mr. Runk just showed me
the damage outside,

572
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:52,823
and it looks like you two
had a rough night.

573
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:55,117
How are the both of you still alive?

574
00:33:58,162 --> 00:33:59,413
I guess we're just lucky.

575
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:02,208
Well, Hoshi and Rawlins' luck
is about to run out.

576
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:05,086
I've got APBs out for both of them
across the whole state.

577
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:07,964
And the information you provided
helped us

578
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:09,807
freeze their accounts
and seize their assets.

579
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:12,885
Which means the Arañas
are out of business.

580
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:15,763
Do you mind if I ask you
a few more questions at the station?

581
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:19,559
Lydia, I think,
was trying to catch a bus.

582
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:21,852
Not anymore.

583
00:34:30,695 --> 00:34:33,114
Twenty million views and counting.

584
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:35,690
This is our biggest story yet.

585
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:38,076
Wow.

586
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:41,872
Guys,

587
00:34:42,707 --> 00:34:43,791
thank you.

588
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:46,294
I owe you.

589
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:49,839
Which is why...

590
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:53,634
Look, if you need to expose
the truth about me,

591
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:55,845
- I get it.
- Allegra,

592
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:59,056
you reminded us today
of the oldest rule in the book.

593
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:00,975
Always protect your sources.

594
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:02,893
And each other.

595
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:07,173
We're gonna keep your secret, too.

596
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:10,526
For as long as you want us to.

597
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:12,695
Thank you.

598
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:15,906
Hey, did you put a call
into the Keystone PD Commissioner

599
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,992
- to get a comment about the Arañas?
- Already did.

600
00:35:18,326 --> 00:35:21,370
Let's hit our old contacts
at McCulloch Tech.

601
00:35:21,454 --> 00:35:22,663
- Yes.
- Guys,

602
00:35:22,747 --> 00:35:24,165
it's like 4:00 a.m.

603
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:25,688
Yeah, that's what the coffee is for.

604
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:28,085
Plus, we need to get a follow-up out,

605
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:29,795
right after I call my babysitter.

606
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:31,932
Probably gonna charge me
a fortune for this.

607
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:38,304
You're not gonna join them?

608
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:39,721
Seriously?

609
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:42,016
You're not firing me for,

610
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:44,644
you know, everything?

611
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:48,022
You were trying to save
the lives of your co-workers.

612
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:49,481
So, no.

613
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,399
Plus,

614
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:54,028
you're a great investigative reporter.

615
00:35:56,572 --> 00:35:58,449
Thanks for keeping us safe today,

616
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:00,033
boss.

617
00:36:03,037 --> 00:36:08,084
Hey, those photos of me and Flash,
where did you find them?

618
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:10,586
Chirper. It's not that hard, really.

619
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:14,674
Um, Allegra,

620
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:18,260
I know you're not hiding
from us anymore,

621
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,806
but how long can you hide
from the rest of the world?

622
00:36:30,523 --> 00:36:32,274
Man, you should have seen her
last night.

623
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:34,777
She totally crushed the leadership game.

624
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:41,242
I'm talking Janeway-meets-AOC
meets-Angela-Davis-type leadership.

625
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:43,869
Well, I don't know about Janeway,

626
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:49,250
but, no, it was really nice
to just be myself.

627
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:52,712
Feel like I didn't have to hide.

628
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:54,213
Nice work.

629
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:55,840
You really stepped up. Both of you.

630
00:36:56,132 --> 00:36:58,634
And if Hoshi or Rawlins
make any more moves,

631
00:36:58,718 --> 00:37:00,261
obviously, I've got your back.

632
00:37:00,344 --> 00:37:01,344
Thanks.

633
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:03,472
So, how did it go on Lian Yu?

634
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,100
Did you find any answers
on the speedster?

635
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:10,229
Uh... Yeah, not exactly. I did find some

636
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,481
perspective.

637
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:15,109
Incoming video message?

638
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:17,944

<i>to tell you all this in person,</i>

641
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:26,746
<i>but I can't go back there. Not yet.</i>

642
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:29,331
<i>Barry, when you left my apartment,</i>

643
00:37:29,832 --> 00:37:31,459
<i>I wasn't sure how to feel.</i>

644
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,587
<i>And the truth is, I'm still not.</i>

645
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:37,882
<i>I just know it hurts.</i>

646
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:44,847
<i>So, I'm gonna go away
for a little while.</i>

647
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,432
<i>I'm gonna stay with Carla.</i>

648
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,768
<i>For real this time.</i>

649
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,854
<i>I just need some space to think.</i>

650
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:56,233
<i>And I don't know
when I'll be ready to come back.</i>

651
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:57,317
<i>So,</i>

652
00:37:58,194 --> 00:37:59,194
<i>until then...</i>

653
00:38:00,446 --> 00:38:02,531
<i>just know that I love you all.</i>

654
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:07,870
Is she gonna be okay?

655
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:11,207
Yeah, I think she is.

656
00:38:33,354 --> 00:38:34,915
That's something
you don't see every day.

657
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:36,774
Someone returning the tech they stole.

658
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,280
Listen, hey, I just want to talk to you.

659
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:50,704
Listen, I...

660
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:55,626
I just have some questions.

661
00:39:28,868 --> 00:39:31,537
I can run at the speed
of sound, but you...

662
00:39:31,662 --> 00:39:34,999
Can run a lot faster than that.
Look, the point is, you can't outrun me.

663
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:37,060
So why don't you just tell me who
you are and what's really going on?

664
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:40,546
Look, I'm not a super-villain.
That fire was an accident.

665
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:43,340
I know. But you risked people's lives
to steal a battery.

666
00:39:43,424 --> 00:39:45,092
And I'm so sorry about that.

667
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:49,054
I'm not a natural speedster like you.

668
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,117
That's why you've been so hard to trace.

669
00:39:52,141 --> 00:39:53,767
- Your speed's temporary.
- Exactly.

670
00:39:53,893 --> 00:39:55,269
You see, my...

671
00:39:56,687 --> 00:40:00,774
associate and I found a way
to generate my own speed source.

672
00:40:00,858 --> 00:40:04,153
I'm still trying to work out the kinks,
so the effects only last a few minutes.

673
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:06,131
I thought maybe the battery
could help extend the window,

674
00:40:06,155 --> 00:40:08,198
and I figured
why spend another four years

675
00:40:08,282 --> 00:40:09,909
calibrating sodium nitrate cells

676
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:14,496
when I could just borrow
the one I'd already made?

677
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,418
I designed the original Newton battery
when I was a young engineer

678
00:40:19,877 --> 00:40:21,211
working here at Ivo.

679
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:24,423
The Newton battery
was invented by Meena Dhawan.

680
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:37,186
It's Dr. Meena Dhawan, actually.

681
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:40,981
You're the CEO of Fast Track Labs.

682
00:40:41,065 --> 00:40:42,816
Your book,
<i>Quantum Gravity & the Universe,</i>

683
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,611
I've read it three times.
You're a genius.

684
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:48,864
That's surprising.

685
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:50,741
And very flattering.

686
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:54,703
Unfortunately, this genius intellect

687
00:40:54,787 --> 00:40:57,498
hasn't been any help
in mastering these new abilities.

688
00:40:57,831 --> 00:41:00,167
That's why I've been trying
to take a low profile,

689
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,585
running trials with my team.

690
00:41:02,002 --> 00:41:03,170
The truth is...

691
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:06,674
I just want to use my gifts
to help people.

692
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:09,385
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

693
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:14,139
When I first got my speed, I...

694
00:41:15,391 --> 00:41:16,475
I had a mentor.

695
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:20,270
Someone to coach me
on how to use my powers.

696
00:41:20,688 --> 00:41:21,897
So, if you're interested...

697
00:41:23,691 --> 00:41:25,109
You'd really do that for me?

698
00:41:30,698 --> 00:41:31,698
Thank you.

699
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,952
I promise you won't regret this.
