1
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:09,076
Oh, my God.

2
00:01:09,243 --> 00:01:10,828
Christ!

3
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,875
Shit.

4
00:01:22,965 --> 00:01:25,384
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

5
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:28,387
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Think, think, think.

6
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:33,559
Oh, my gosh.

7
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:05,216
Okay. Come on, come on, come on.

8
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:07,259
Come on.

9
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:14,266
My name is Walter Hartwell White.

10
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:19,939
I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane,
Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.

11
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:23,984
To all law-enforcement entities,
this is not an admission of guilt.

12
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:27,113
I am speaking to my family now.

13
00:02:33,828 --> 00:02:35,830
Skyler.

14
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:38,249
You are the love of my life.

15
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,418
I hope you know that.

16
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,838
Walter Jr.

17
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:46,132
You're my big man.

18
00:02:46,465 --> 00:02:51,095
There are...
There are going to be some things...

19
00:02:51,262 --> 00:02:53,931
Things that you'll come to learn about me

20
00:02:54,098 --> 00:02:55,808
in the next few days.

21
00:02:55,975 --> 00:03:01,480
I just want you to know
that no matter how it may look

22
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:04,316
I only had you in my heart.

23
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:12,074
Goodbye.

24
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:13,969
<i>...money before the panel
earlier this year.</i>

25
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:15,573
Happy birthday.

26
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:19,243
Look at that.

27
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,580
{\an8}That is veggie bacon.

28
00:05:22,746 --> 00:05:24,646
Believe it or not. Zero cholesterol,

29
00:05:24,748 --> 00:05:27,334
and you won't even taste the difference.

30
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,045
What time do you think you'll be home?

31
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,297
{\an8}Same time.

32
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:33,613
{\an8}I don't want him
dicking you around tonight.

33
00:05:33,757 --> 00:05:37,636
{\an8}You get paid till 5,
you work till 5. No later.

34
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:40,639
{\an8}Hey.

35
00:05:41,432 --> 00:05:43,475
{\an8}- Hey, happy birthday.
- Well, thank you.

36
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:45,519
You're late again.

37
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:48,314
There was no hot water again.

38
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,357
I have an easy fix for that.

39
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:55,154
You wake up early, and then you get
to be the first person in the shower.

40
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,947
I have an idea.

41
00:05:59,033 --> 00:06:02,369
How about buy a new hot-water heater?

42
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:07,333
How's that idea?
For the million-billionth time.

43
00:06:09,793 --> 00:06:12,338
- Did you take your echinacea?
- Yeah.

44
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:14,465
I think it's getting better.

45
00:06:14,632 --> 00:06:17,134
What the hell is this?

46
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:18,593
- Hey.
- It's veggie bacon.

47
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:21,555
We're watching our cholesterol, I guess.

48
00:06:21,764 --> 00:06:25,476
Not me. I want real bacon.
Not this fake crap.

49
00:06:25,643 --> 00:06:27,269
Too bad. Eat it.

50
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,900
- This smells like Band-Aids.
- Eat it.

51
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:42,326
- So how does it feel to be old?
- How does it feel to be a smart-ass?

52
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:44,870
Good.

53
00:06:46,497 --> 00:06:48,165
Eat your veggie bacon.

54
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,936
{\an8}- You're all set?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

55
00:07:09,103 --> 00:07:12,064
{\an8}- All right, see you at home.
- Okay, see you.

56
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:17,444
{\an8}Chemistry.

57
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:20,364
{\an8}It is the study of what?

58
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:23,242
{\an8}Anyone?

59
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:25,953
Ben.

60
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,914
- Chemicals.
- Chemicals.

61
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,458
No.

62
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,086
Chemistry is...

63
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:39,466
Well, technically,
chemistry is the study of matter.

64
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:42,761
But I prefer to see it
as the study of change.

65
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:45,597
Now, just... Just think about this.

66
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:47,307
Electrons.

67
00:07:47,474 --> 00:07:49,059
They

68
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:51,268
change their energy levels.

69
00:07:51,395 --> 00:07:53,272
Molecules.

70
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,275
Molecules change their bonds.

71
00:07:56,859 --> 00:08:01,572
Elements. They combine
and change into compounds.

72
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,450
Well, that's... That's all of life, right?

73
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:07,316
I mean, it's just...
It's the constant, it's the cycle.

74
00:08:07,411 --> 00:08:12,291
It's solution, dissolution,
just over and over and over.

75
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:17,463
It is growth, then decay,
then transformation.

76
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:23,469
It is fascinating, really.

77
00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:30,434
Chad.

78
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:34,021
Is there something wrong with your table?

79
00:08:36,648 --> 00:08:39,777
Okay, ionic bonds.

80
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:50,662
Are you done?

81
00:08:52,915 --> 00:08:56,502
Ionic bonds. Chapter six.

82
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,516
One, two, three makes 10,
and 10 makes 20.

83
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:11,732
There's your receipt.

84
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,300
Just hand this disc
to your car-wash professional.

85
00:09:14,436 --> 00:09:16,688
Thank you. Come again.

86
00:09:28,075 --> 00:09:31,203
He's not coming. He says he quits.

87
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,372
I'm gonna run the register.

88
00:09:33,872 --> 00:09:36,375
Bogdan, no. We talked about this.

89
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:39,002
I'm short-handed, Walter.
What am I to do?

90
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,590
Walter?

91
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,010
What am I to do?

92
00:10:07,072 --> 00:10:09,408
Hey, Mr. White.

93
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:14,079
- Make those tires shine, huh?
- Oh, my God.

94
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,790
You will not believe
who's cleaning Chad's car.

95
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:18,876
Mr. White.

96
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:20,252
From chemistry.

97
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:42,149
Surprise!

98
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:44,151
Happy birthday, Dad.

99
00:10:44,318 --> 00:10:46,528
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

100
00:10:47,738 --> 00:10:51,491
- Oh, you're so very late.
- Happy birthday.

101
00:10:51,658 --> 00:10:56,580
Really, I'm serious, Skyler.
I mean, you're flat as a washboard.

102
00:10:56,747 --> 00:10:58,457
You look awesome.

103
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:02,461
- She's not showing at all, is she?
- She's showing a little.

104
00:11:03,587 --> 00:11:06,256
Carmen, this is my sister, Marie.

105
00:11:06,423 --> 00:11:08,592
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

106
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:12,638
Glock 22, that's my daily carry, okay?

107
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:15,641
I mean, unless you're talking,
what, Plus P Plus loads

108
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:17,476
you can forget the 9 mil.

109
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:20,543
Shit, I seen one of those
bounce off a windshield one time.

110
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,606
- Yeah, with you shooting.
- Hey.

111
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,365
If you're gonna bring a gun, baby,
you gotta bring enough gun.

112
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,278
Forty caliber.

113
00:11:29,112 --> 00:11:30,780
- This is awesome.
- Nice, isn't it?

114
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:34,826
- Yeah. Dad, come check this out.
- Yeah, I see it.

115
00:11:34,993 --> 00:11:37,454
- Come on, take it.
- Yeah. Check it out, Walt.

116
00:11:39,373 --> 00:11:43,335
- No, no, it's just heavy.
- That's why they hire men.

117
00:11:44,586 --> 00:11:46,046
Hey, it's not gonna bite you.

118
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:49,841
Looks like Keith Richards
with a glass of warm milk, doesn't he?

119
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:53,826
Hey, Walt. Everybody, listen up,
listen up, listen up.

120
00:11:53,971 --> 00:11:57,808
I'm gonna give a toast, a little toast
to my brother-in-law. Come here.

121
00:11:58,225 --> 00:12:02,354
Walt, you got a brain
the size of Wisconsin,

122
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,856
but we're not gonna hold that
against you.

123
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,491
But your heart's in the right place.

124
00:12:07,609 --> 00:12:10,153
Your heart's in the right place.
We love you, man.

125
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,864
Everybody, to Walt.

126
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:20,205
Oh, shit. Turn on channel three.

127
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,044
<i>At which point we apprehended three
individuals and placed them in custody.</i>

128
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:28,714
<i>I'm proud to say
the outstanding professionalism</i>

129
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,175
<i>of my fellow agents
at the Albuquerque District Office</i>

130
00:12:32,342 --> 00:12:35,136
<i>resulted in a substantial amount
of methamphetamine</i>

131
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,770
<i>being taken off the streets.</i>

132
00:12:36,888 --> 00:12:38,724
<i>- Were any shots fired?
- No, ma'am.</i>

133
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,940
<i>Our agents took the suspects by surprise.</i>

134
00:12:41,143 --> 00:12:45,063
- Damn. The TV does add 10 pounds.
- Ten pounds?

135
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,899
Hey, sit and spin, both of you.

136
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:50,152
- Hank.
- What?

137
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:53,030
Sorry. You didn't see that.

138
00:12:53,447 --> 00:12:54,698
So charming.

139
00:12:54,865 --> 00:12:58,869
<i>- -clearly an ongoing operation.
- One which was well-organized...</i>

140
00:12:59,036 --> 00:13:01,663
- Hank, how much money is that?
- It's about 700 grand.

141
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,047
It was a pretty good haul.

142
00:13:03,206 --> 00:13:06,156
{\an8}<i>As I say, it's a good day
for the citizens of Albuquerque</i>

143
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:09,151
{\an8}<i>when we can put this big a dent
in the local drug trade.</i>

144
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:12,382
{\an8}Well, that's unusual, isn't it?
That kind of cash?

145
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:18,055
Well, it's not the most we ever took.
It's easy money, till we catch you.

146
00:13:18,555 --> 00:13:21,391
Walt, just say the word
and I'll take you on a ride-along.

147
00:13:21,475 --> 00:13:23,810
You can watch us knock down
a meth lab, huh?

148
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:25,937
Get a little excitement in your life.

149
00:13:26,563 --> 00:13:28,774
Yeah, someday.

150
00:13:37,574 --> 00:13:39,326
Which one's this?

151
00:13:39,493 --> 00:13:43,789
That faux-Lalique vase
I picked up at the Super-Swap.

152
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:49,795
How's it doing?

153
00:13:49,961 --> 00:13:54,216
Well, I met my reserve
and there's still two minutes.

154
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:02,974
What's up?

155
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:05,519
You tell me, birthday boy.

156
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:10,857
Oh, hey, so, what's up for Saturday?

157
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:14,361
Car wash.
Bogdan says he needs me.

158
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:18,865
- Till what time? Noon, 1-ish?
- Probably 2, more like it.

159
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:21,493
And then what after that?

160
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,788
Actually

161
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:29,960
I was thinking of driving up
to Los Alamos. They've got this...

162
00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:33,964
The visitor center has an exhibit on
that's really supposed to be...

163
00:14:34,131 --> 00:14:36,883
- You're not gonna paint?
- No, I'll paint.

164
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,011
It's just that this...

165
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:45,559
You know, this exhibition
on the Mars-rover photographs are...

166
00:14:45,892 --> 00:14:49,187
I mean, the detail
really is just supposed to be amazing.

167
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:52,104
It's just that I really need you to paint
at some point.

168
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,440
The sooner that back bedroom
gets finished...

169
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:55,527
I know.

170
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,894
And I'd do it myself, except you don't
want me on the stepladder.

171
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,408
- I will paint.
- Okay.

172
00:15:04,411 --> 00:15:07,539
- What is going on down there?
- No, it's...

173
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,875
Is he asleep?

174
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,503
No, it's nothing. He's just...

175
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,840
You know. Well, you gotta be careful
about the baby and...

176
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:20,260
Well, don't worry about the baby.
This is just for you.

177
00:15:20,427 --> 00:15:24,556
We are just doing you tonight.

178
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,809
So just close your eyes

179
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:30,812
relax, and let it...

180
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:36,234
- Close your eyes.
- Oh, okay.

181
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,320
Okay.

182
00:15:39,821 --> 00:15:41,573
There you go.

183
00:15:41,865 --> 00:15:43,450
That's it.

184
00:15:43,867 --> 00:15:45,952
That's it.

185
00:15:46,244 --> 00:15:48,872
There you go.

186
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:51,082
Keep it going.

187
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,585
Keep it going.

188
00:15:54,085 --> 00:15:56,588
Keep it going.

189
00:15:57,088 --> 00:16:01,426
Keep... Yes! Fifty-six.

190
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:55,438
This is so embarrassing.
I am fine, honestly.

191
00:16:56,273 --> 00:16:57,983
It's just some bug going around.

192
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:00,527
First, my wife had it, then my son,
and now me.

193
00:17:00,694 --> 00:17:05,031
It's just... It's just like a chest cold.

194
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:07,074
Could be some low blood sugar as well.

195
00:17:07,158 --> 00:17:10,578
I didn't have the greatest breakfast
this morning. Honestly, I didn't.

196
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:13,665
Hey, listen, can you do me a favor?
Can you just

197
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,834
drop me off at a corner somewhere?

198
00:17:17,335 --> 00:17:19,129
No, sorry.

199
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,340
It's just that
I don't have the greatest insurance.

200
00:17:22,507 --> 00:17:24,357
Take a couple of deep breaths for me.

201
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,199
Is there anybody
you want us to contact for you?

202
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:35,562
No. God, no.

203
00:17:35,729 --> 00:17:37,981
Lean forward for me, would you?

204
00:17:40,817 --> 00:17:45,447
- Mr. White, are you a smoker?
- No, never.

205
00:17:47,157 --> 00:17:48,450
Why do you ask?

206
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:30,075
Mr. White?

207
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,744
Mr. White?

208
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,121
Yes?

209
00:18:36,414 --> 00:18:38,500
You understood
what I've just said to you?

210
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:40,710
Yes.

211
00:18:40,877 --> 00:18:43,713
Lung cancer. Inoperable.

212
00:18:45,507 --> 00:18:50,595
I'm sorry. I just need to make sure
you fully understand.

213
00:18:51,054 --> 00:18:57,060
Best-case scenario, with chemo,
I'll live maybe another couple years.

214
00:18:58,603 --> 00:19:00,438
It's just

215
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:03,274
you've got mustard on your...

216
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:07,779
Right there. You got mustard there.

217
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:09,614
Right there.

218
00:19:18,748 --> 00:19:20,667
So my records show that I paid it,

219
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:23,878
and I certainly don't feel
that we owe any late...

220
00:19:24,045 --> 00:19:25,630
Yeah, all right.

221
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:29,217
Well, I'll check with the bank
and maybe the post office

222
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:31,636
if they lost it or something.

223
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:34,889
Yeah, let me look into that. Okay.

224
00:19:35,056 --> 00:19:36,182
Thank you.

225
00:19:39,227 --> 00:19:40,854
Hey.

226
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,647
Hey.

227
00:19:45,191 --> 00:19:48,570
Did you use the MasterCard last month?

228
00:19:48,737 --> 00:19:51,781
Fifteen eighty-eight at Staples?

229
00:19:57,704 --> 00:19:59,664
We needed printer paper.

230
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:03,376
Walt, the MasterCard’s
the one we don’t use.

231
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:05,837
Okay.

232
00:20:06,463 --> 00:20:09,507
So how was your day?

233
00:20:10,717 --> 00:20:12,510
Oh, you know.

234
00:20:13,678 --> 00:20:15,680
I don't know. It was...

235
00:20:18,308 --> 00:20:19,809
fine.

236
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:49,297
Hey, Walter.

237
00:20:49,464 --> 00:20:50,924
Walter.

238
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:54,803
Walter. I'm shorthanded.
I need you outside to do wipe downs.

239
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:56,054
- Come on.
- What?

240
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,264
I said I need you to do some wipe downs.

241
00:20:58,431 --> 00:21:00,809
Are you here to work,
or to stare at the skies?

242
00:21:00,975 --> 00:21:02,894
Come on. Let's go.

243
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:06,231
Come on, man.

244
00:21:06,397 --> 00:21:07,899
Fuck you, Bogdan.

245
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:11,903
- What?
- I said, "fuck you." And your eyebrows.

246
00:21:16,616 --> 00:21:18,576
Wipe down this.

247
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:23,099
Hank? Hank, it’s Walt. Hey.

248
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,852
Oh, listen. I didn’t wake you, did I?

249
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:28,354
Oh, good, good.

250
00:22:28,521 --> 00:22:32,108
Oh, no, no.
Nothing's wrong. I just...

251
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:38,323
I’ve been thinking about
that offer of that ride-along.

252
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:40,907
It's the last house on the right.
See it?

253
00:22:41,034 --> 00:22:43,084
Not the two-story one,
the one next to it.

254
00:22:43,244 --> 00:22:46,122
Kind of... I don't know,
what do you call that?

255
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:49,000
- Green?
- Sage.

256
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:50,752
Sage?

257
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:53,219
Do you work at the fucking
Pottery Barn? Jesus.

258
00:22:53,379 --> 00:22:55,590
Sage. That’s the word for it.

259
00:22:55,757 --> 00:22:58,718
My fault the only word
your dumb-ass knows is "green"?

260
00:22:58,885 --> 00:23:01,930
"Cheese-dick." I know that one.
How about that?

261
00:23:02,597 --> 00:23:05,016
Anyway, it's the sage one. See it?

262
00:23:05,224 --> 00:23:07,769
So, what tells you it’s a meth lab?

263
00:23:07,936 --> 00:23:09,228
Just our snitch.

264
00:23:09,395 --> 00:23:12,065
Says some dude who goes by "Cap’n Cook"

265
00:23:12,231 --> 00:23:13,881
lives up to his name in there.

266
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:18,112
Says he always adds
a dash of chili powder.

267
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:21,199
You exuberant Mexicans.

268
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,618
"Cap’n Cook"?
That’s a white boy’s name.

269
00:23:23,785 --> 00:23:24,911
Dopey as hell too.

270
00:23:25,078 --> 00:23:27,080
Yeah? I'll tell you what.

271
00:23:27,246 --> 00:23:29,832
I got you 20 bucks
that says he’s a beaner.

272
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:32,377
- All right.
- You’re on.

273
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,714
All right.
Come on, come on, come on.

274
00:23:40,134 --> 00:23:42,884
All right. School bus is clear.
You got the green light.

275
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:44,597
<i>Copy that.</i>

276
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,691
Watch this. Makes them shit.

277
00:23:58,194 --> 00:23:59,529
Go, go, go, go!

278
00:24:10,331 --> 00:24:12,031
Meth labs are nasty on a good day.

279
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:14,516
You mix that shit wrong
and you got mustard gas.

280
00:24:14,627 --> 00:24:16,713
Phosphine gas.

281
00:24:17,463 --> 00:24:19,674
- I think.
- Yeah, exactly.

282
00:24:19,841 --> 00:24:22,427
One whiff will kill you.
That’s why the respirators.

283
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:13,102
<i>House is clear.
One suspect in custody.</i>

284
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:15,646
Copy that. The suspect

285
00:25:15,813 --> 00:25:18,024
might he be of the Latino persuasion?

286
00:25:18,191 --> 00:25:21,194
<i>Driver's license says
"Emilio Koyama."</i>

287
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,698
- Asian. Pay up, sucker.
- Hey, hey. First name, Emilio.

288
00:25:25,865 --> 00:25:27,533
That's at least half a beaner.

289
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,536
Tell you what, I'll let you off for a 10.

290
00:25:31,996 --> 00:25:33,164
Cheer up, Gomey.

291
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,582
- You people still got J. Lo.
- Hank.

292
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:38,669
Do you think I might get to go inside?

293
00:25:38,836 --> 00:25:40,880
See the actual lab?

294
00:25:44,717 --> 00:25:48,017
Yeah. Yeah, I'll tell you what,
we’re gonna go peek our heads in

295
00:25:48,137 --> 00:25:50,139
check it out first.

296
00:25:50,306 --> 00:25:53,059
Stay here a minute. Let's go, Frank.

297
00:26:12,954 --> 00:26:14,372
Oh, God.

298
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:23,923
Oh, God.

299
00:26:31,472 --> 00:26:32,765
Oh, my God.

300
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:36,269
Pinkman?

301
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:54,745
<i>Cap'n.</i>

302
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:36,913
Hey. It’s me. I’m alone.

303
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:46,923
- How’d you find me?
- You’re still in our filing system.

304
00:27:50,134 --> 00:27:53,346
So your aunt owns this place, right?

305
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:54,680
I own it.

306
00:27:58,267 --> 00:27:59,894
Look, no one's looking for you.

307
00:28:00,061 --> 00:28:01,812
Why are you here?

308
00:28:01,979 --> 00:28:04,232
I was curious.

309
00:28:04,815 --> 00:28:07,318
Honestly, I never expected
you to amount to much,

310
00:28:08,152 --> 00:28:10,196
but methamphetamine?

311
00:28:11,906 --> 00:28:14,033
I didn’t picture that.

312
00:28:15,368 --> 00:28:18,996
- There's a lot of money in it, huh?
- Don’t know what you’re talking about.

313
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,831
- No?
- Not a clue.

314
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:24,710
Cap’n Cook?

315
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:27,088
That’s not you?

316
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,971
Like I said, no one is looking for you.

317
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:39,183
Look, I don’t know what you think
you’re doing here, Mr. White.

318
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,650
I mean, if you’re planning
on giving me some

319
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:45,189
bull-winder about getting right
with Jesus or turning myself in...

320
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:48,276
- Not really.
- High school was a long time ago.

321
00:28:48,442 --> 00:28:52,947
You ain’t <i>Welcome Back, Kotter,</i>
so step off. No speeches.

322
00:28:53,114 --> 00:28:54,907
Short speech.

323
00:28:55,241 --> 00:28:58,536
You lost your partner today.
What’s-his-name.

324
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:01,330
Emilio?

325
00:29:02,248 --> 00:29:04,792
Emilio is going to prison.

326
00:29:06,294 --> 00:29:09,922
The DEA took all your money, your lab.

327
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,717
You've got nothing.

328
00:29:12,883 --> 00:29:14,510
Square one.

329
00:29:15,303 --> 00:29:17,388
But you know the business,

330
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:20,850
and I know the chemistry.

331
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:26,063
I’m thinking

332
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,441
maybe you and I could partner up.

333
00:29:39,827 --> 00:29:43,497
You wanna cook crystal meth?

334
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,208
You.

335
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:49,879
You and me.

336
00:29:50,046 --> 00:29:51,589
That's right.

337
00:29:54,342 --> 00:29:58,763
Either that, or I turn you in.

338
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:11,650
- What the hell is this?
- Damned if I know.

339
00:30:11,817 --> 00:30:13,944
I described it as mosaic folk art.

340
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:16,863
- And somebody bought it?
- Yeah, some guy in Minneapolis.

341
00:30:16,947 --> 00:30:19,408
Fourteen dollars plus shipping. Yes.

342
00:30:19,575 --> 00:30:22,578
At this rate,
in 50 or 60 years you’ll be rich.

343
00:30:23,704 --> 00:30:27,792
- So how goes the novel?
- It's not a novel, actually, which I...

344
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:29,543
You're not writing a novel?

345
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,860
- You told me you were.
- No. Short stories.

346
00:30:31,962 --> 00:30:34,548
I said that if eventually
I have enough good ones

347
00:30:34,715 --> 00:30:36,509
that maybe I'll try,

348
00:30:37,551 --> 00:30:39,251
and publish another collection.

349
00:30:39,387 --> 00:30:41,931
Those really didn't sell.

350
00:30:42,515 --> 00:30:45,976
I just thought a novel
would be easier to sell.

351
00:30:46,143 --> 00:30:48,646
Yeah, well, maybe so.

352
00:30:49,397 --> 00:30:52,297
Ever want me to read anything,
I could critique it for you.

353
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,028
No.

354
00:30:57,696 --> 00:31:01,742
I mean, I'm just not
at that stage where I...

355
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,621
- No.
- Open offer.

356
00:31:06,914 --> 00:31:10,459
- So, what’s up with Walt lately?
- What do you mean? He’s fine.

357
00:31:10,626 --> 00:31:12,545
He just seems

358
00:31:12,711 --> 00:31:14,672
I don’t know. Quieter than usual.

359
00:31:15,548 --> 00:31:17,383
Turning 50 is a big deal.

360
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:21,345
I mean, I’m sure as hell
not looking forward to 40.

361
00:31:22,721 --> 00:31:25,015
You're gonna be a basket-case.

362
00:31:29,437 --> 00:31:32,940
- So it’s a mid-life crisis.
- No. He’s just quiet.

363
00:31:34,108 --> 00:31:37,111
- How’s the sex?
- Marie, Jesus.

364
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,029
I guess that answers that.

365
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:23,032
You just gonna sit there?

366
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,834
Look at this. Look at this.

367
00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:38,672
Kjeldahl-style recovery flask,
800 millilitres. Very rare.

368
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:41,592
You got your usual paraphernalia,
Griffin beakers

369
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:45,721
your Erlenmeyer flask.
But the <i>pièce de résistance</i>

370
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:50,559
a round-bottom boiling flask,
5000 millilitres.

371
00:32:53,562 --> 00:32:56,357
I cook in one of those. A big one.

372
00:32:57,858 --> 00:32:59,443
One of these?

373
00:33:00,069 --> 00:33:03,369
No, this is an volumetric flask.
You wouldn’t cook in one of these.

374
00:33:03,489 --> 00:33:06,534
- Yeah. I do.
- No, you don’t.

375
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,579
A volumetric flask is for
general mixing and titration.

376
00:33:10,746 --> 00:33:13,582
You wouldn't apply heat
to a volumetric flask.

377
00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:15,626
That’s what a boiling flask is for.

378
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:18,170
Did you learn nothing
from my chemistry class?

379
00:33:18,337 --> 00:33:21,423
No. You flunked me, remember?

380
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,884
- No wonder.
- Prick.

381
00:33:24,051 --> 00:33:27,555
And let me tell you something else.
This ain’t chemistry.

382
00:33:27,721 --> 00:33:29,723
Okay, this is art.

383
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:31,475
Cooking is art,

384
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:34,770
and shit I cook is the bomb,
so don’t be telling me.

385
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:37,439
Shit you cook is shit.

386
00:33:37,606 --> 00:33:39,692
I saw your setup. Ridiculous.

387
00:33:39,858 --> 00:33:42,528
You and I will not make garbage.

388
00:33:42,695 --> 00:33:45,447
We will produce a chemically pure
and stable product

389
00:33:45,614 --> 00:33:47,914
that performs as advertised.
No adulterants.

390
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:51,870
- No baby formula. No chili powder.
- No, no. Chili P's my signature.

391
00:33:52,037 --> 00:33:53,247
Not anymore.

392
00:33:54,498 --> 00:33:57,459
Yeah, well, we’ll see about that.

393
00:33:57,626 --> 00:34:00,129
- What the hell is this?
- Lab safety equipment.

394
00:34:00,296 --> 00:34:03,799
We’re also gonna have
an emergency eye-wash station.

395
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:06,635
These chemicals
and their fumes are toxic.

396
00:34:06,802 --> 00:34:08,470
In case you didn’t you know that.

397
00:34:08,637 --> 00:34:11,849
Well, you can dress up
like a faggot if you want. Not me.

398
00:34:17,146 --> 00:34:22,151
Listen, this stuff doesn’t
stay more than a day.

399
00:34:22,318 --> 00:34:25,654
- I thought we were gonna cook here.
- No, we’re not gonna cook here.

400
00:34:25,738 --> 00:34:28,741
Okay, this is my house.
I don’t shit where I eat.

401
00:34:28,907 --> 00:34:32,244
- Well, then where are we gonna work?
- You tell me.

402
00:34:32,411 --> 00:34:36,081
This is your deal. You wanna smoke
it up, smoke it up at your house.

403
00:34:36,665 --> 00:34:39,960
No, I didn’t think so. Oh, well.

404
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:43,088
Well

405
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:47,051
what if we rented one of those
self-storage places?

406
00:34:47,217 --> 00:34:50,117
You know, those little orange garages?
Worked out of there?

407
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:54,099
No, they’re onto that.
They've got dogs that sniff around.

408
00:34:55,851 --> 00:34:58,729
RV, that’s what you want.

409
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,315
What, like a Winnebago?

410
00:35:03,692 --> 00:35:05,110
Yeah.

411
00:35:06,862 --> 00:35:11,533
I know a dude who wants to sell his.
He just goes camping with it.

412
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,119
But a mobile meth lab?
That'd be the bomb.

413
00:35:14,286 --> 00:35:17,414
I mean, you can drive way out
in the boonies.

414
00:35:18,248 --> 00:35:19,750
Be all evasive.

415
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:50,823
Dude, this isn't even 7 grand,
all right? My guy wants 85.

416
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:53,867
This is all the money
I have in the world.

417
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:56,537
You’re a drug dealer. Negotiate.

418
00:35:58,163 --> 00:36:00,624
You are not how I remember
you from class.

419
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:03,627
- I mean, like, not at all.
- Yeah, well, I gotta go.

420
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:05,254
Wait. Wait. Hold up.

421
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:09,883
Tell me why you’re doing this.
Seriously.

422
00:36:10,634 --> 00:36:14,304
- Why do you do it?
- Money, mainly.

423
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:19,601
- There you go.
- No, come on, man.

424
00:36:19,768 --> 00:36:22,229
Some straight like you,
giant stick up his ass

425
00:36:22,396 --> 00:36:25,733
all a sudden at age, what, 60,
he’s just gonna break bad?

426
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,318
- I’m 50.
- It’s weird, is all.

427
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:30,696
Okay, it doesn’t compute. Listen

428
00:36:30,863 --> 00:36:33,490
if you’ve gone crazy or something

429
00:36:33,657 --> 00:36:37,494
I mean, if you’ve gone crazy,
or depressed.

430
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:39,830
I’m just saying.

431
00:36:40,873 --> 00:36:42,791
That’s something I need to know about.

432
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:45,169
Okay, I mean, that affects me.

433
00:36:50,883 --> 00:36:53,010
I am awake.

434
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,056
What?

435
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,187
Buy the RV.

436
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,232
We start tomorrow.

437
00:37:12,696 --> 00:37:14,698
How's it coming in there?

438
00:37:15,073 --> 00:37:17,117
Fine.

439
00:37:23,332 --> 00:37:25,751
Do you want me or your dad?

440
00:37:27,586 --> 00:37:29,713
Dad.

441
00:37:45,521 --> 00:37:48,371
So how are those feeling in the waist?
Are they too tight?

442
00:37:48,482 --> 00:37:50,832
You don’t want to get them
if they’re too tight.

443
00:37:50,943 --> 00:37:54,196
They’re... They're pretty shrunk.

444
00:37:54,363 --> 00:37:57,157
Are you sure you don’t want the...?
Like a different kind?

445
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:58,992
Like, you know, the skinny jeans

446
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:01,759
because those are in style.
The skaters wear them.

447
00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:05,541
- Do I look like a skater?
- All right.

448
00:38:05,749 --> 00:38:08,752
Mom, get them, my big-boy pants.

449
00:38:10,504 --> 00:38:14,258
Mommy, could you zip up my big-boy pants?

450
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,056
- Don’t.
- What?

451
00:38:23,183 --> 00:38:25,602
- Don't.
- Walt.

452
00:38:28,397 --> 00:38:30,274
I have no idea.

453
00:38:31,692 --> 00:38:33,792
No, you know what?
Don't even look at them.

454
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:36,989
- They're obviously very stupid.
- Yep.

455
00:38:37,155 --> 00:38:38,282
Yeah.

456
00:38:40,367 --> 00:38:43,495
I think that... I think those jeans
look really good on you.

457
00:38:43,662 --> 00:38:46,456
I think you should get them
if you like them, okay?

458
00:38:46,623 --> 00:38:49,623
Why don't you hang out here
for a second? I'll be right back.

459
00:38:49,793 --> 00:38:50,794
Fine.

460
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:55,799
Hey, Mommy, I think I pinched a loaf
in my brand-new big-boy pants.

461
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,351
- What are you doing?
- What’s wrong? Having trouble walking?

462
00:39:06,685 --> 00:39:09,313
Get off me! Get off me!

463
00:39:12,649 --> 00:39:14,151
I’ll mess you up, man.

464
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:16,668
You'll have one shot.
You'd better make it good.

465
00:39:17,029 --> 00:39:19,364
You waiting for your girlfriends?
Better go.

466
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:22,534
You'd better go. Take it.
Take your shot. Take it!

467
00:39:23,702 --> 00:39:24,828
Come on.

468
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,520
- Come on.
- Come on, let's get out of here.

469
00:39:27,664 --> 00:39:29,041
Let's go.

470
00:39:30,626 --> 00:39:32,169
Psycho.

471
00:40:07,788 --> 00:40:10,290
Yeah, nothing but cows.

472
00:40:10,457 --> 00:40:13,794
Got some big cow house
way out that way, like two miles,

473
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:16,505
but I don't see nobody.

474
00:40:16,755 --> 00:40:21,259
- "Cow house"?
- Yeah. Where they live.

475
00:40:21,426 --> 00:40:22,678
The cows.

476
00:40:23,887 --> 00:40:27,975
Whatever, man.
Shit, yeah. Let's cook here.

477
00:40:30,018 --> 00:40:31,728
Cow house.

478
00:40:32,437 --> 00:40:33,689
God help me.

479
00:40:45,784 --> 00:40:49,913
- What are you doing?
- These are my good clothes.

480
00:40:50,706 --> 00:40:53,208
You can't go home
smelling like a meth lab.

481
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:55,919
Yeah, you can. I do.

482
00:40:56,795 --> 00:41:01,717
Those? Those...
You're keeping those on, right?

483
00:41:10,058 --> 00:41:12,561
Come on. Daylight's burning.

484
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,272
Oh, my God.

485
00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:25,490
Wow, this is a good look for you.

486
00:41:25,657 --> 00:41:28,952
I mean, you're maybe only
the world's second-biggest homo.

487
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,538
Would you shut up and help me?

488
00:41:31,997 --> 00:41:34,291
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

489
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:39,046
- Work it. Baby, work it.
- Turn that off.

490
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:47,864
This is glass-grade.

491
00:42:48,698 --> 00:42:54,121
You got... Jesus, you got crystals
in here 2 inches, 3 inches long.

492
00:42:54,287 --> 00:42:55,914
This is pure glass.

493
00:42:57,624 --> 00:42:59,835
You're a goddamn artist.

494
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:03,130
This is art, Mr. White.

495
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:05,780
Well, actually,
it's just basic chemistry,

496
00:43:05,882 --> 00:43:08,677
but thank you, Jesse.
I'm glad it's acceptable.

497
00:43:08,844 --> 00:43:11,638
Acceptable?
You're the goddamn Iron Chef.

498
00:43:11,888 --> 00:43:14,688
Every jibhead from here to Timbuktu's
gonna want a taste.

499
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:21,064
- Man, I gotta try this.
- No. No.

500
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:23,984
No. We only sell it. We don't use it.

501
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:26,903
Okay, since when?

502
00:43:27,737 --> 00:43:30,323
Listen, you've been watching
way too much <i>Miami Vice.</i>

503
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:31,658
That ain't happening.

504
00:43:35,704 --> 00:43:38,582
So, what now?

505
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:41,668
How do we proceed?

506
00:43:45,797 --> 00:43:47,966
We cook more tomorrow.

507
00:43:49,092 --> 00:43:50,927
Meantime

508
00:43:51,344 --> 00:43:53,722
I know just the guy to talk to.

509
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:56,975
Get him. Come on.

510
00:44:02,981 --> 00:44:06,151
Hey, yo. Kraze, how you doing,
my man?

511
00:44:08,403 --> 00:44:12,616
Hey, you got a new dog.
Right on, man.

512
00:44:12,908 --> 00:44:14,784
What's his name?

513
00:44:15,827 --> 00:44:19,831
Yeah, I had a dog like that once,
except maybe like twice as big.

514
00:44:19,998 --> 00:44:21,625
Super-purebred.

515
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:25,378
Now, me personally, I would train him
to go straight for the nutsack.

516
00:44:25,545 --> 00:44:27,695
Just shut your mouth
and show me your money.

517
00:44:27,797 --> 00:44:29,341
I ain't buying, <i>ése</i>.

518
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,010
I'm selling.

519
00:44:41,061 --> 00:44:44,648
Tell me that ain't the finest scante
you ever laid eyes on.

520
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,984
Go ahead. Try it.

521
00:44:48,151 --> 00:44:50,779
Hey, poochie. How you doing?

522
00:44:51,529 --> 00:44:53,657
Jesus Christ.

523
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:57,160
Yeah. Booya! See, what'd I say?

524
00:44:57,953 --> 00:44:59,704
- It's all right.
- It's all right?

525
00:44:59,871 --> 00:45:01,721
It's all right? Yeah, it's all right.

526
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:05,168
- So what? You're back in business?
- Hell, yeah, I'm back.

527
00:45:05,418 --> 00:45:08,838
With a vengeance.
<i>Vato loco </i>gotta make a living.

528
00:45:09,005 --> 00:45:11,800
You know, with your cousin
gone away and all...

529
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:15,262
And listen, homes, about that...

530
00:45:16,846 --> 00:45:19,349
Really broke me up about Emilio.

531
00:45:20,058 --> 00:45:22,060
That dude is like my brother.

532
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:25,272
- You okay? You talk to him?
- Yeah, I talk to him.

533
00:45:25,563 --> 00:45:29,567
Said when the feds came, you were
out sticking it in some neighbor lady.

534
00:45:29,734 --> 00:45:34,030
- Hey, you know, I got lucky twice.
- I don't know, man.

535
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:35,949
Emilio...

536
00:45:38,034 --> 00:45:40,453
he thinks maybe you dimed on him.

537
00:45:40,996 --> 00:45:44,082
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.
That is bullshit.

538
00:45:44,874 --> 00:45:47,002
That is bullshit, Krazy, eh?

539
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:49,838
I should kick his punk ass
for even thinking that.

540
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,882
You know what? Next time
you talk to Emilio

541
00:45:53,049 --> 00:45:54,759
you tell him for me, all right?

542
00:45:58,888 --> 00:46:01,975
Why don't you tell him yourself?
Made bail this morning.

543
00:46:02,142 --> 00:46:05,061
Go ahead, <i>pendejo</i>. Kick my ass.

544
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:06,812
Hey, listen...

545
00:46:09,941 --> 00:46:11,901
Where did you get this?

546
00:46:13,778 --> 00:46:16,614
Because I know your little punk ass
didn't cook it.

547
00:46:45,685 --> 00:46:49,898
Damn, man. What are you,
some kind of nudist?

548
00:46:51,857 --> 00:46:55,195
Yeah, that's some stone-fine tick-tick
you been cooking there, <i>ése</i>.

549
00:46:55,362 --> 00:46:57,030
How about you come work for me?

550
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:01,451
I'd be willing to sell it to you

551
00:47:01,951 --> 00:47:03,370
if the price is right.

552
00:47:14,381 --> 00:47:16,466
Out here all by yourself, huh?

553
00:47:24,057 --> 00:47:28,144
Hey, I know you.
He was there when I got busted.

554
00:47:28,311 --> 00:47:30,355
- He's with the DEA.
- No.

555
00:47:31,064 --> 00:47:33,608
You <i>rata</i> snitch motherfucker.

556
00:47:33,983 --> 00:47:35,318
Run, Mr. White! Run!

557
00:47:45,703 --> 00:47:47,247
I say we cap them both.

558
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,714
You really cook up that batch?

559
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:01,344
- Yeah.
- You an artist.

560
00:48:03,179 --> 00:48:05,931
- It's a damn shame.
- Wait.

561
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:07,517
Wait a minute.

562
00:48:08,184 --> 00:48:12,856
Listen to me.
I'll teach you my recipe, huh?

563
00:48:13,022 --> 00:48:15,233
What do you say?
You wanna cook like me?

564
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:20,572
You let us both live,

565
00:48:21,781 --> 00:48:25,452
and I will teach you, huh?

566
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:56,900
Put the cigarette out.

567
00:48:59,694 --> 00:49:01,112
Please...

568
00:49:44,572 --> 00:49:48,033
Move it, homes. Ain't got all day.

569
00:49:50,745 --> 00:49:52,121
Okay.

570
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,601
Shit!

571
00:54:03,456 --> 00:54:05,082
What happened?

572
00:54:07,752 --> 00:54:10,338
Hey, what'd you do to them?

573
00:54:12,256 --> 00:54:16,010
Red phosphorus in the presence
of moisture and accelerated by heat

574
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:18,554
yields phosphorus hydride.

575
00:54:19,597 --> 00:54:21,599
Phosphine gas.

576
00:54:21,974 --> 00:54:24,143
One good whiff and...

577
00:54:48,751 --> 00:54:50,419
We gotta...

578
00:54:52,421 --> 00:54:55,758
We gotta clean this up.

579
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:44,807
Where were you?

580
00:55:53,107 --> 00:55:54,734
Walt...

581
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,870
I don't know what's
been going on with you lately

582
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:02,783
- but...
- Nothing, honey. I'm fine.

583
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:07,204
Whatever it is, I'll tell you this.

584
00:56:07,747 --> 00:56:11,000
I do not like it
when you don't talk to me.

585
00:56:12,376 --> 00:56:15,379
The worst thing you can do
is shut me out.

586
00:57:01,425 --> 00:57:03,177
Walt...

587
00:57:05,596 --> 00:57:10,101
Oh, Walt, is that you?
