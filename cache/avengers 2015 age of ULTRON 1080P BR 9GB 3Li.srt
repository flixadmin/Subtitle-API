You just roll over, show your belly every time somebody snarls?

604
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,760
Only when I've created a murder bot.

605
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,121
We didn't. We weren't even close.

606
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,446
Were we close to an interface?

607
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,100
Well, you did something right. And you did it right here.

608
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,009
The Avengers were supposed to be different than S.H.I.E.L.D.

609
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,210
Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?

We can bust arms dealers all the livelong day,

But it doesn't go off.

Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?

1152

Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things.

1153
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,168
I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception.

1154
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:54,282
Yeah, give him time.

1155
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,363
We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.

Is that a problem?

1160
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,483

You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?

1164
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,401
Well, I guess you'd know.

1165
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,806
Whether you'd tell us is a bit of a question.

1166
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,086
Banner and I were doing research.

1167
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:24,441
- That would affect the team.
- That would end the team!

1168
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,761
Isn't that the mission?

1169
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,200
Isn't that the "Why We Fight"?

1170
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,561
So we can end the fight. So we get to go home!

You come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony.

1210
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,371
War isn't one of them.

1211
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,405
I watched my friends die.

1212
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,682

- <i>The worst part...</i>

1216
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,406

I like the look.

1219

If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss.

1220

I need your help.

1222

It's dangerous.

1223
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,689

I don't think it's just one thing.

1228
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:19,011

1232

<i><font color="#808080">FURY:</font> Yes, he is.</i>

1234
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,330
But he's not making any headway.

1235
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:34,522
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.

1236
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,220
Well, I contacted our friends at the Nexus about that.

1237
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,321

1243
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,680
But the codes are constantly being changed.

1244
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:50,161
By whom?

1245
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,606
Parties unknown.

1246
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:53,926
Do we have an ally?

1247
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,361
Ultron's got an enemy. That's not the same thing.

1248
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:58,563
<i>Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.</i>

1249
01:12:58,680 --> 01:12:59,841

Well, this is good times, boss,

1252
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,841
but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.

1253
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,882
I do. I have you.

1254
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,524
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere.

1255
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:11,966
Ears, everywhere else.

1256
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,324
<i>You kids had all the tech you could dream up.</i>

1257
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,322
Here we all are, back on Earth,

1258
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,050
with nothing but our wit and our will to save the world.

1259
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,802
Ultron says the Avengers are the only thing...

1260
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,445
between him and his mission.

1261
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,722
<i>And whether or not he admits it,</i>

1262
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,611
his mission is global destruction.

1263
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,002
All this, laid in a grave.

1264
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,724
So stand.

1265
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,249
Outwit the platinum bastard.

1266
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,320
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

1267
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,641
You know what, Romanoff?

1268
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,171
So, what does he want?

1269
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,609
To become better.

1270
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,085
Better than us.

1271
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,841
- He keeps building bodies.
- Person bodies.

1272
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,044
<i>The human form is inefficient.</i>

1273
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,362
<i>Biologically speaking, we're outmoded.</i>

1274
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,448
<i>But he keeps coming back to it.</i>

1275
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:06,051
When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed.

1276
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,203
They don't need to be protected.

1277
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,410
They need to evolve.

1278
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,528
Ultron's going to evolve.

1279
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:15,767
How?

1280
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,765
Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho?

1281

they're binding them.

1284

<i>to look within.</i>

1290

I'll take Natasha and Clint.

1291
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,728
All right. Strictly recon. I'll hit the Nexus.

1292

I'll join you as soon as I can.

1293

If Ultron's really building a body...

1294
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,365
He'll be more powerful than any of us.

1295
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:04,641
Maybe all of us.

1296

1297

1301

She's all yours. Apparently.

1302
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:17,601

1303
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,843
I don't know. Something dramatic, I hope.

Yeah, then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart.

02:09:52,200 --> 02:09:54,362
Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book.

2108
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:57,444
Build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up.

2109
02:09:58,240 --> 02:09:59,401
The simple life.

2110
02:09:59,680 --> 02:10:01,967
- You'll get there one day.
- I don't know.

2111
02:10:02,200 --> 02:10:04,601
Family, stability...

2112
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:08,889
The guy who wanted all that went in the ice 75 years ago.

2113
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:12,243
I think someone else came out.

2114
02:10:16,200 --> 02:10:17,281
You all right?

2115
02:10:17,480 --> 02:10:19,847
<font color="#D900D9">(SOLDIERS SHOUTING IN DISTANCE)</font>

2116
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:21,405
I'm home.

2117
02:10:29,320 --> 02:10:32,085
You wanna keep staring at the wall, or do you wanna go to work?

2118
02:10:32,240 --> 02:10:33,571
I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.

2119
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:36,740
I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes.

2120
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:37,887
How do we look?

2121
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:40,407
Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.

2122
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:42,244
We got some hitters.

2123
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:44,801
They're good. They're not a team.

2124
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:46,610
Let's beat them into shape.

2125
02:11:05,080 --> 02:11:06,605
Avengers...

2126
02:13:25,440 --> 02:13:26,885
<font color="#808080">THANOS:</font> Fine.

2127
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:30,163
I'll do it myself.
