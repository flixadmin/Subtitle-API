[Yi-kyung] <i>I'm all healed.</i>

00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,605
[Eun-yu] Stop it.

11
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,859
You're not able to heal quickly.

12
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,325
What do you remember?

13
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,120
I had...

14
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,291
a strange dream.

15
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,960
That was real.

[deep breath]

17
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,007
You became a monster.

18
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,053
You don't have to worry, though.

19
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,805
Hyun-su found a way to bring you back.

[paper peeling]

He's been like that

29
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,806
since he brought you back.

30
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,777
We decided to keep an eye on him.

31
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,738
We can't force him awake.

32
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,990
He might do something dangerous.

he can see into
the human minds of monsters.

00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,212
About your strange dream,

37

was he there with you?

38
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,551
I could hear his voice.

[Yi-kyung] <i>I think he was trying
to get a hold of me.</i>

Maybe here.

Oh!

Found it! Secret stash. [chuckles]

58
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,119
Are you sure it's okay
to leave him like that?

59
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,242
Don't worry. He won't die.

60
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,539
Even poisonous mushrooms
only upset his stomach.

Ah.

What?

Yeah.

What's your story?
You don't seem like family.

A story of killing each other.

What?

If we'd become monsters,

I'm going to kill you

That's great.

I don't want to live as a monster anyway.

You can kill me when the time comes.

Okay.

00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,640

Are you crazy?

I thought you liked it a little crazy.

You really want to be around those idiots
who hang out with monsters?

You're doing this because
I didn't let you do that one thing?

Yeah, because that one thing...

102
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,191
is what I want to do most.

103

They can come back from becoming monsters.

They can turn back into humans.

[Ha-ni] Isn't it incredible?

124
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,349
That woman became a monster.

125
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,351
[yells] He turned her back!

126
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,895
He turned her back into a human again!

[heavy breathing]

128

You should think about what you've done.

Hey.

133
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,010

What do you think?

139
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,042
You know how the man always is.

140
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,589
He may be stubborn and stuck-up...

141
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,426
but he's soft at heart, so it's okay.

142
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,154
Why are you in a rush
while he's still in that state?

143
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,533
Tell him I said thank you.

144
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,397
Tell him yourself.
Don't keep asking me to tell him things.

145
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,455
I don't have time.

146
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,748
That child

147
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,334
will turn other people into monsters
like she did to me.

148
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,210
Why would she?

149
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,463
Because she doesn't trust anyone.

150
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,091
She thinks they're always out to hurt her.

151
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,550
Do you know where she is?

152
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,095
We can look for her together
when Hyun-su wakes up.

153
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,102
She would've gone back to the stadium.

154
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,645
It's the only place she knows.

155
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,898
This is all my fault.

156
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,194
I need to make it right
before it's too late.

157

[sighs]

158
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,034
Take it.

159
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,913
It'll make it easier for you
to get around.

160
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,766
[Eun-yu] Yi-kyung really
just left us like that.

[somber piano music playing]

162
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:15,359
I could walk away without a second glance
if I really wanted.

163
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,622
You know me.

164
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,835
I'm a rude bitch.

165
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,593
My family is the same way.

167
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,058
Even... Eun-hyeok too.

168
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,563
He's one cold bastard.

[inhales deeply]

170
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,867
Do you think he's holding on...

171
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,120

Yes.

[sighs] I can't just
take your word for it,

To be precise, they <i>were</i> monsters,

Monsters don't attack the cocoons.

Therefore, you must use
the cocoons to stay alive.

People have died,

They're all gonna die
when they set foot outside.

271

So how is it a crime to get there sooner?

you will have to do it first.

00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,625
[snickering]

337
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,754
Arrogant.
[laughing]

338
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:46,466
So arrogant.

339
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,860
- [screaming] Arrogant!
- [banging]

340
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,761
You think that you're any different?

341
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,473
No parent on earth

342
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,893
would give up so easily on their child.

343
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,104
Not one.

344
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,777
I killed mine with my own hands.

345
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,533
At the start of the outbreak,
the first monster I executed...

346
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,411
was my son.

347
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,459
We've never encountered
something like this.

348
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,213
He hasn't shown
signs of aggression so far,

349
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,674
but we can't just leave him here.

350
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,973
Your child's removal has been decided.

351
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,933
You have until then

352
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,686
to decide whether you'll leave here

353
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,355
or if you're going to stay.

354
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,532

Let go! Let go!

[coughing]

360
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,519
You wanna take the coward's way, huh?

361
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,812
Who said you could?

362
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,940
You really think
I'd just let you go like that?

363
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,983
[panting]

364
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,321
You think you protected him, don't you?

365
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,448
You didn't.

366
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,954
You turned your son
into a murderous monster.

367
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,040
He was eating people at will

368
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,585
without even realizing what he was doing.

369
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:54,803
[rope thuds]

[Jin-ho] <i>Are we just leaving it like that?</i>

372
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:07,482
[Dong-jun] Master Sergeant Tak's orders.
So shut the guys up.

373
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,985
I've never seen one like that before.

374
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:15,031
Do you think, last time the sensors
went off, it was the monster?

375
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,408
I guess so.

376
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,660
It's probably a Type Green.

377
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,330
It showed no signs
of response or aggression.

378
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,499
[Jin-ho] Then who killed all those people?

379
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,626
There were at least a dozen corpses there.

380
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,004
[inhales deeply]

381
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,006
What about Sergeant Kim? Any word?

382
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,968
No, no response yet.

383
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:38,680
What should we do?

384
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,183
We'll ask Sergeant Tak for a search

385
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,269
if we don't hear from them by tomorrow.

386
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:49,149
[electricity crackling]

387
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,568
Reduce the supply to the lowest setting,

388
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,111
just until the power stabilizes.

389

- Hey.
- Damn it!

396
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,019
[boy] You'll probably get kicked out
like your murderer friend.

397
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,355
So hand that over and piss off!

398
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,774
There are plenty of other baseballs.

399
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,067
Why do you want mine?

400
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,069
[boy] My little brother says he wants it.

401
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,113
He likes this one,
not any of the others.

[Yeong-su grunts]

Just you wait.

404
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,330
I'll get you back for this!

405
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,833
[scoffs] How will you do that?

406
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,751
You don't have a mom or a dad.

407
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,338
I'll become a monster.

408
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,966
I'll become a monster and kill you all.

409

[sighs] Honestly, I don't.

Then go! Leave me alone and go.

I should probably do something.

Don't bother!
