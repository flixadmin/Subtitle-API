The technology Strange is using to create

383

Then he wouldn't have been the man he was.

True.

385
00:23:51,807 --> 00:23:53,600
But he wouldn't be dead, either.

386

Along with your mother.

387
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:59,564
Are those ideals
that your father cherished so worth it?

But the answer has always been
right in front of you.

400
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:34,284
Bruce, your father orphaned you.

401

His actions fired the bullet
that killed him and your mother.

402

He knew what he was doing,
and he did it anyway.
