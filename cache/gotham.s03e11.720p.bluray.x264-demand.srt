00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:06,427
My name is Volk. My brother, Jacob.
We are called "the Whisper Gang."

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,887
BRUCE: Those men were willing to kill
for this key.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,370
- But what does it open?
- A safe.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,434
Inside, there is a device
that we believe can destroy them.

6
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:15,349
They call themselves "The Court of Owls."

7
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,610
Isabella was murdered.
Her brake lines were cut!

8
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:18,769
And I know who did it.

9
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,735
You can stop the blade from being
released, if you click this button.

10
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:24,821
It will send a fatal jolt to Butch.

11
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,280
Hey, Butch? You're sweet.

12
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,029
No!

13
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,947
- You really didn't kill her?
- No!

14
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,114
Guilty!

15
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,285
The lab analyzing Alice Tetch's blood
has developed a test.

16
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,452
You're kidding.

we'll pull your car around.

Get down!

19
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,846

20
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,257
(CHOKING) You know why.

21
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,891
Why are you trying to kill my son?

22
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,724
We will expect your assistance
when called on.

23
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,729
Until then, your son is safe.

24
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,310
At least from us.

25
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,687
Why does it feel like
we keep saying goodbye?

26
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,970
Maybe it's all we have left.

27
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:02,571
Or we just haven't done it properly yet.

28
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,026
Goodbye, James Gordon.

You know, people always talk about

I never believed it.

40

But the moment I saw her, I knew.

00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,213
Yeah.

42
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,124

43
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,254
I'm a hematologist at Gotham Bio-Lab.

You aren't working
on that blood virus, are you?

Tetch? Alice Tetch?

Uh, my fiancée
is with the police department.

- She's the medical examiner on the case.
- Oh.

00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,153
Yes.

49
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,192
She said you had come up with a test
for the virus.

50
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,069
I really can't talk about it.

51
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,913
She almost married someone else.

52
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:43,130
I think her ex still hopes
she'll come running back.

We found his and Dmitry's bodies
early this morning.

65
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,453
They were killed by Talon,
the Court's assassin.

I'll say that changes things a bit,
doesn't it?

67
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,759
How? You possess a key.
The key opens a safe.

68
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,807
Inside the safe is an object
that can bring down the Court of Owls.

69

None of these has changed.

70
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,641
If this assassin saw us with Volk...

71
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,163
That means the Court already knows

that you're breaking your deal,
Master Bruce.

or how far we can trust
this little Whisper Gang front.

Now ask yourself this.

77

Is bringing down the Court
really worth the risk?

needed to do that?

Also, I have spies all over the city.

Soon enough, whoever killed Isabella
will reveal themselves,

has the means and opportunity.

two things.

One, Oswald did not kill Isabella.

And two, he is not in love with me.

156

Are you so certain?

Don't you owe it to her to find out?

one of the windows.

163
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,896
Once inside, the front door can be
opened using a code that we possess.

164
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:37,313
The second alarm is in the basement,
in the room with the safe.

165
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,773
The floor is fitted with infrared sensors.

166
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,438
You must cross it on a rope.

167
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,608
I have trained for this.

168
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,414
You will give me the key you found,
and I will retrieve the object.

169
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,947
But you still don't know
what the object is, right?

170
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:53,287
Only that the Court protects it. Fears it.

171
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,579
And that with Talon hunting us,
we have no time.

172
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,052
Right, so let's go through this again.

173
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,258
What'd you decide?

174
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:10,342
We're gonna break in today.
We can't wait any longer.

175
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,520
- You okay?
- Fine.

176
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,355
Just hungry.

177
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,811
JIM: GCPD.

178
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,866
A guy named Ryan Pfeffer work here?

179
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:30,700
Uh, yeah. He's sub-level 3.
What, he in trouble?

180
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,365
He was killed last night.
I need to talk to his colleagues.

181
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,331
You guys keep track
of when keycards are used?

182
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,493
Uh, yeah.

183
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,161
All right.

184
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,830
If anybody uses his, call me.

185
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,749
Sure, but his was used 20 minutes ago.

186
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,384
He hasn't logged out.

187
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,170
Call the police. Now.

188
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,861

(ALARM BLARING)

190
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,951
Jim, Jim.

191
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:22,874
You're ahead of schedule.
Our paths weren't meant to cross just yet.

192
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,087
But I'm not gonna kill you yet.

193
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,056
I do that, you become the martyr.

194
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,593
And she'll carry you in her heart forever.

195
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,853
No. Before I kill you,

196
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,640
she has to hate you.

197
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,307
And she will.

198
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,275
Come find me, Jim.

199
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,706
So you didn't get a look at the guy.
And he's not on the cameras.

200
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,242
We might get something
off the prints, but...

201
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,378
Doubtful, if he was smart enough
to avoid the cameras. I'm good.

202
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,585
He seems to have been interested in
the research into Alice Tetch's blood.

203
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,250
Pfeffer's office was ransacked
and their files were missing.

204
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:11,092
So someone else is infected
with the virus? That's just great.

205
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,302
It isn't you, is it'?
Because that sure would make things easy.

206
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,434
No. It's not me. What's that on your hand?

207
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,429
"Arkham." I didn't write it.

208
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,939
Okay, let's all just calm down.

209
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,316
So the virus-infected killer
wrote on your hand.

210
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,439
He wants you to go to Arkham.

211
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,728
Barnes is in Arkham.

212
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,526
No. It's not about Barnes.

213
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,951
- Jim, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

214
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,991
(DOOR ALARM BUZZES)

215
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,123
- Hello, Jervis.
- James.

216
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,626
What an unexpected pleasure.

217
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,132
Someone else is infected
with your sister's blood.

218
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,295
You don't say!

219
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:57,138
And I've been thinking, it's possible
she infected them accidentally.

220
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,854
Yes, possible, possible.

221
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,265
But your reaction tells me you knew.

222
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:07,481
So, you infected them
after you stole your sister's blood.

223
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,944
But you stayed quiet,
waiting for them to show symptoms.

224
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,656
Well, that would be darn sneaky of me,
wouldn't it?

225
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,242
I need the name.

226
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,408
(CHUCKLING) You need the name.

227
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,161
So, I've been quiet about it
all this time,

228
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,672
and now I'm going to help you,

229
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,798
because we're such good friends?

230
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,381
Because I can make your life here
very uncomfortable.

231
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,012
More uncomfortable than having
Captain Barnes next door

232
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,890
screaming, "Guilty!"
all hours of the night?

233
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,346
Give me the name!

234
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:45,023
(CHUCKLING) Oh, James, I would love to see
what Alice's virus would do to you.

235
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:50,779
The beast in you is right there,
so desperate to get out.

236
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:57,531
And I know of whom you speak,
oh, yes, indeed.

237
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,368
I stabbed him and pricked him
and caused him to bleed.

238
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,782
But nothing you can say,

239
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:05,248
no words you might possess
can pry from me the smallest guess.

240
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,084
For this game is my game.

241
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,044
I say when it's done.

242
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,426
And right now I'm having too much fun.

243
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,255
You wanna play a game, Jervis?

244
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,807
Fine. Let's play a game.

245
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:25,897
Whoever you infected
has some sort of plan.

246
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,435
I want you to tell me
the name of this man.

247
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:36,275
Well, James,
I have to give that effort an F.

248
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,735
And can you really imagine that...

249
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,075
Two are dead. More may die soon.

250
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,582
This isn't a game, give me his name.

251
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,501
You'll only know his name
when it's too late,

252
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,499
when the one you love
has been murdered by hate.

253
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,581
Guard! Take me to my cell!

254
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,750
- What do you mean "the one that I love"?
- Guard!

255
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,760
Give me his name, Tetch. Give me his name!
Or you share the blame!

256
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,091
Nothing! Nothing! I'll tell you naught!

257
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,597
His name shall be
neither spoken nor taught.

258
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,996
He'll cut, and he'll crush,
and the blood will run thick!

259
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,391
Though from healer to killer
is no easy trick! (GROANS)

260
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,771
"Healer to killer."

261
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,183
He's a doctor.

262
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,477
Oh, my God.

263
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,270
You'll never stop him, James!

264
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,690
He'll kill, and he'll kill,
and he'll kill!

265
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,016
This is Jim Gordon.
Get me Dr. Mario Calvi immediately.

266
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,699
On my damn authority! Just do it!

267
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,672

(SIGHS)

269
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:43,092
When we were casing that place,
I got a feeling we were being watched.

270
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,478
And if this Court of Owls is all you say,

271
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,310
they're not gonna be too cool
with Bruce breaking their deal.

272
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,349
That's very true.

273
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:56,981
But Master Bruce knows the Court
will catch up with him sooner or later.

274
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,774
And if he has the opportunity to
take them out, then he will take them out.

275
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,158
That's a big "if."

276
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,161
Especially when your stupid job
is supposed to be protecting him.

277
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,617
My stupid job, miss,

278
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,660
is to make sure that he grows up
to be the man he's meant to be.

279
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:11,999
Still.

280
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:16,503
Kind of a punk move for him to make a deal
with the people who killed his parents.

281
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,146
Yeah, well, you understand this then.

282
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,181
He only did what he did
to protect the people he cares about.

283
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,179
For you.

284
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,099
And it cost him dearly.

285
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,280
Are you serious? Arresting
Don Falcone's son on his wedding day?

286
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,032
I had no choice. He's got the virus.

287
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,864
Do you really think Lee Thompkins,
Dr. Lee Thompkins,

288
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,994
wouldn't know if her own fiancé
had the virus?

289
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,248
How long did Barnes have it and hide it?

290
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:51,455
Tetch must have infected him that night
in the hospital when he dosed me.

291
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,210
- It would explain things.
- Like what?

292
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,218
Mario hitting me at the engagement party.

293
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,044
You know what also would explain that?

294
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,584
You telling Tetch to shoot his fiancée.

295
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,299
You should've seen his face when those
assassins attacked us, his rage.

296
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,055
He was being attacked by assassins!

297
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,432
What was I supposed to do, Harvey?
Wait until he kills again?

298
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:07,638
Till he hurts Lee?

299
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,880
You were supposed to wait
until you had enough proof.

300
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:13,106
And why would Tetch infect Mario
in the first place?

301
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,356
To hurt me.

302
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,995
Okay, let's say you're right.
Let's say that Mario is infected.

303
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,983
So he crushes some guy's skull.
He breaks into the lab.

304
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:23,571
He attacks you and then
he writes "Arkham" on your hand?

305
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,361
Why would he want you to find him?

306
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,742
I don't know.

307
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,707
He doesn't have the virus.

308
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,584
What? No, no, no. Run it again.

309
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,837
I ran it three times. He's clean.

310
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,090
I could've told you that.
But, hey, I'm glad it's official.

311
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,423
Dr. Calvi, on behalf of the GCPD,

312
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:43,928
I just want to apologize for any

313
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,965
inconvenience or embarrassment
this may have caused you.

314
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,806
No need. Living with Lee, I understand
the pressures you're all under.

315
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,437
But if you'll excuse me,

I understand this is a tough day for you.

318

But no hard feelings.

319

That's why you broke into the lab.

I'm gonna prove it.

00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,571
But she didn't say anything?

325

She said she thought
we were being watched.

she's just got the jitters.

stoked his anger at the guilty.

so he could find out how to beat it,

489

he had me arrest him

Well, we'll work on that. Drinks!

641
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:46,968
Hey.

642
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:51,356
Thank you.

643
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,519
Thank you.
For letting us leave that party early.

644
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:59,155
Mmm. Of course.
I wanted to. I love this house.

645
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:02,909
It's my father's refuge.
Not many people know about it.

646
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:09,291
I know Gordon came to the church,
talked to you.

647
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,167
It was just like you said. (SCOFFS)

648
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,829
He said you had the virus.
He was obsessed.

649
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:17,415
And what did you say?

650
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,426
That after the wedding
we would be leaving Gotham.

651
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,087
And I would never see him again.

652
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,926
Is that it?

653
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,841
What are you asking me?

654
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,885
I'm asking

655
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,848
if there's any part of you, however small,

656
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,358
that still has feelings for him.

657
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:39,859
And I swear I will never ask you again.

658
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,200
A part of me will always care for him.

659
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,451
But I married you.

660
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,535
I love you.

661
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,045
That's all I needed to know.

662
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,759
- Where are they?
- GOON: Don Falcone, he just...

663
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,519
Where are they?

664
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,354
You don't give up, do you?

665
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,437
Your son has Alice Tetch's virus.

666
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:20,229
He's killed two people we know of.
Every cop in this city is after him.

667
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,442
Where is he?

668
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:30,454
You knew?

669
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,867
That Mario had the same virus
as Barnes? No.

670
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,081
I knew he was in danger,
but I didn't know why.

671
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,583
I never suspected this.

672
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:42,250
You're saying the attacks on Mario,
the car bomb...

673
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:43,760
It's because of the virus?

674
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,421
How is that possible? Who knew he had it?

675
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,679
I can't tell you that.

676
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,806
I'll send my men to bring Mario in.

677
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,393
You think I'd trust Lee's life
with these two goons?

678
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,767
Tell me where they are.

679
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,356
If I do that, you'll kill him.
I know you, James.

680
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:04,280
Mario is my son.

681
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:08,242
There is nothing and no one
more valuable to me.

682
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:11,029
And if he does have this sickness,
he needs help.

683
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,948
And if he kills Lee, he'll cross a line
he'll never come back from.

684
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:18,165
Even if he's cured,
knowing that will destroy him.

685
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,874
I'm your only hope.

686
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,796
Still, I'll send my men.

687
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,676
You mean these two?

(BOTH GROAN)

689
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,973
Anyone else you want to send?

690
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,431
Swear that you'll bring him in alive.

691
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:37,473
I swear. Now, where are they?

692
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,821
MARIO: She loves him. She loves him.

693
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,698
She loves him.

694
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:49,484
She loves him.

695
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,869
She loves him.

696
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:53,905
She loves him.
