AND MAN GRUNTS]

459
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,219
Clear.

460
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,558
Freeze!

461
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,481
DOCTOR:
You don't look so good.

462
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,525
I doubt you could aim a single arrow.

463
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:43,772
COUNT:
Looks like I'm the last one standing.

464
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,609
Sitting.

465
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,987
Spinning.

466
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,782
Something to do.

467
00:33:55,116 --> 00:34:00,080
What was I going to do?
Memory not what it once was.

468
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:04,334
Nothing what it once was.

469
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:14,928
Is there a name on the gravestone?

470
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:18,807
No.

471
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,643
It's new...

472
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,020
...and clean...

473
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,523
...and waiting.

474
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,579
We're finished here.

475
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,630
OLIVER: Hey. How we doing?
-In the black.

476
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,674
Did the Hood get his man?

477
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:58,555
Well, we won't be having any problems
with Vertigo anymore.

478
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:02,559
-Look, Tommy, I'm sorry...
-I've caught up the bookkeeping...

479
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:05,228
...and all my notes on the inventory
are in there...

480
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:09,482
-...along with the list of suppliers we use.
-Okay.

481
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:14,404
-I don't see why you're telling me that.
-This club is important to me.

482
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:16,573
But for you it's just a front.

483
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:20,243
You want me to keep your secret,
help you be this thing you've become...

484
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,829
...but you refuse to see me
for what I've become.

485
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,167
I've got just a bit too much
self-respect for that.

486
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:30,879
I quit.

487
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,598
SLADE:
Dinner.

488
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,266
You're still doing that?

489
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:47,020
Fyers better be careful
with his bowls of water.

490
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,939
When are we gonna do actual training?

491
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,942
SHADO: There once was a young boy
whose father dropped him off...

492
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:57,530
-...at a Shaolin monastery to study kung fu.
-Good. A story.

493
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,700
After a year,
the boy came to visit his family.

494
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:05,246
When asked what he'd learned,
the boy hung his head in shame.

495
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,875
All the monks had him do was slap water
in a barrel for a year.

496
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:13,296
We don't have a year, so I hope
your training regimen is a bit faster.

497
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,802
The family didn't believe him,
so he showed them.

498
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,931
He raised his hand
and hit the table they were eating on.

499
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,976
-It broke in half.
-I'm going to be able to break a table?

500
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,645
Better.

501
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,025
[OLIVER SIGHS]

502
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:38,988
Okay.

503
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,751
Draw the bow.

504
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:00,802
I'll be damned.

505
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:08,351
What's next?

506
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:10,645
We teach you to shoot.

507
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:32,625
-Drinking alone?
-Oh. Well, not anymore.

508
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,632
Just soda?

509
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,552
Bartender forget the Scotch?

510
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:45,305
I didn't really feel the need for it.

511
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,850
So, um...

512
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,227
The girl who died...

513
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:54,481
...turns out that she got her Vertigo
from a co-worker.

514
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:58,067
-Guess I owe your boyfriend an apology.
-He has a name, you know.

515
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,237
I just can't seem to bring myself
to use it. Baby steps.

516
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:07,535
Did I screw things up between us again?

517
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,331
No.

518
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,420
I really wasn't looking to jam up Merlyn.

519
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:20,381
I knew by pursuing him
that I could throw a wrench in us...

520
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,593
-Then why'd you do it?
-There was evidence, Laurel.

521
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,553
And I had to follow it, I had to.

522
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,681
Your mom was right. You were right.

523
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:32,352
Like you said about me and the Vigilante,
I can't let things go.

524
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:38,858
And I close cases. It's what I do.
Everyone else be damned.

525
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:43,363
Maybe the fact that there's no Scotch
in there means you're ready to work on that.

526
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,116
People can change.

527
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,377
DIGGLE: Hey.
-Hey.

528
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,923
You had my back.

529
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,592
You needed me.

530
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:09,305
-Felicity told me where you were headed.
-You okay.

531
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,308
I'm the killer, remember?

532
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:15,645
I've killed before, Oliver.
It's just been a while.

533
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:22,735
If you're the killer,
why isn't the Count down too?

534
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,572
Sure it must have been tempting,
take him off the board for good.

535
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,575
-People change.
-People like the Count?

536
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:32,245
No, I meant me.

537
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:37,333
Not so long ago,
I would've put that guy down for good...

538
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:42,213
...but looking at him today,
all vacant...

539
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,133
...there didn't seem to be a point.

540
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:50,972
But not everybody deserves mercy.

541
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,181
For example.

542
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:01,441
-I thought he wasn't a priority to you.
-He's a priority to you.

543
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,947
And you two have unfinished business.

544
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,657
Where do we start?

545
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:16,706
I'd prefer we skip the I-told-you-so's,
but the nightclub...

546
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:19,459
...wasn't really working out.

547
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:22,503
I guess I need something more boring.

548
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,297
Stable.

549
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:28,760
Nine to 5, go home, kiss Laurel,
that sort of thing.

550
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,264
I guess what I'm saying is...

551
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,018
...I want a job.
