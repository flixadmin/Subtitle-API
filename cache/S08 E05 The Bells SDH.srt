1
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,433
(Knock on door)

2
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,898
- Come in.
- (Door opens)

3
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:31,943
And?

4
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,614
Nothing?

5
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,074
She won't eat.

6
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,414
We'll try again at supper.

7
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,251
I think they're watching me.

8
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,547
- Who?
- Her soldiers.

9
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,843
Of course they are. That's their job.

10
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,272
What have I told you, Martha?

11
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,652
The greater the risk,
the greater the reward.

12
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,073
Go on. They'll be missing you
in the kitchen.

13
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,500
(Door closes)

14
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,545
(Men speaking indistinctly)

15
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,390
Varys: The northern armies?

16
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,058
Jon: Just crossed the trident.

17
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,853
They'll be at the walls
of king's landing in two days.

18
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,522
How is she?

19
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,442
She hasn't seen anyone
since we returned.

20
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,445
Hasn't left her chambers,
hasn't accepted any food.

21
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,656
She shouldn't be alone.

22
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,743
You're worried for her.
I admire your empathy.

23
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,661
Aren't you worried for her?

24
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,997
I'm worried for all of us.

25
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,291
They say every time
a Targaryen is born,

26
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,544
the gods toss a coin
and the world holds its breath.

27
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,338
We're not much for riddles
where I'm from.

28
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,716
We both know what she's about to do.

29
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:23,972
(Sighs)

30
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,266
That's her decision to make.
She is our queen.

31
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,978
Men decide where power resides,
whether or not they know it.

32
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,733
What do you want?

33
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,651
All I've ever wanted.

34
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,945
The right ruler on the iron throne.

35
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,950
I still don't know
how her coin has landed.

36
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,287
But I'm quite certain about yours.

37
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,297
I don't want it.

38
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,673
Ineverhave.

39
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:00,884
(Sighs)

40
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,971
I have known more kings and queens
than any man living.

41
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:08,141
I've heard what they say to crowds,
and seen what they do in the shadows.

42
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:12,062
I have furthered their designs,
however horrible.

43
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,898
But what I tell you now is true:

44
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,068
You will rule wisely and well,
while she...

45
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,194
She...

46
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,238
Is my queen.

47
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,161
(Sighs)

48
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,052
Your grace?

49
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,621
There's something you need to know.

50
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,208
Someone has betrayed me.

51
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,924
Yes.

52
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,430
Jon snow.

53
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:35,729
Varys.

54
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,025
He knows the truth about Jon.

55
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,652
He does.

56
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,451
Because you told him.

57
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,830
You learned from sansa.

58
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,750
And she learned from Jon,

59
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,919
though I begged him not to tell her.

60
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,005
As I said...

61
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,424
He betrayed me.

62
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,259
I'm glad sansa told me.

63
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,719
I am your hand.

64
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,472
I need to be aware
of any threats you're facing.

65
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,475
And varys?

66
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,019
Your master of whisperers
needs to be aware too.

67
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,105
You spoke to him first.

68
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,191
Without coming to me.

69
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,609
Without asking my permission.

70
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,072
It was a mistake.

71
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,826
Why do you think sansa told you?

72
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,455
- What do you think she hoped to gain?
- She trusts me.

73
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,291
Yes, she trusts you.

74
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:43,588
She trusted you to spread secrets

75
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,216
that could destroy your own queen.

76
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,887
And you did not let her down.

77
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,644
If I have failed you, my queen,
forgive me.

78
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,856
Our intentions were good.

79
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,278
We wanted what you want.
A better world, all of us.

80
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,615
Varys as much as anyone.

81
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,127
But it doesn't matter now.

82
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,216
It doesn't matter now.

83
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,950
(Door opens)

84
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,039
(Footsteps approaching)

85
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:12,862
(Exhales heavily)

86
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,088
It was me.

87
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,679
I hope I deserve this.

88
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,430
Truly, I do.

89
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,015
I hope I'm wrong.

90
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,023
(Breathes deeply)

91
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,191
Goodbye, old friend.

92
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,817
Lord varys.

93
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,068
(Inhales sharply)

94
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:38,698
I, Daenerys of house Targaryen,
first of my name,

95
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,409
breaker of chains
and mother of dragons...

96
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,745
(Low growling)

97
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,371
Sentence you to die.

98
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,508
Dracarys.

99
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:01,221
(Drogon roars)

100
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,938
(Growls)

101
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,188
This was all she brought with her
when we crossed the narrow sea.

102
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,941
Her only possession.

103
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,028
(Speaks valyrian)

104
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,238
It's all right, torgo nudho.

105
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,324
Let me speak with him.

106
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,871
(In English) What did I say
would happen if you told your sister?

107
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,606
I don't want it,
and that's what I told him.

108
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,942
She betrayed your trust.

109
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,320
She killed varys as much as I did.

110
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,199
This was a victory for her.

111
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,120
Now she knows what happens
when people hear the truth about you.

112
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,418
Far more people in Westeros
love you than love me.

113
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,298
I don't have love here.

114
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,635
I only have fear.

115
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,306
I love you.

116
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,062
And you will always be my queen.

117
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,071
Is that all I am to you?

118
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,241
Your queen?

119
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,926
(Jon exhales heavily)

120
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,447
(Softly) All right, then.

121
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,581
Let it be fear.

122
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,464
Tyrion: The people who live there,
they're not your enemies.

123
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,175
They're innocents, like the ones
you liberated in meereen.

124
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,194
Daenerys: In meereen,
the slaves turned on the masters

125
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,096
and liberated the city themselves
the moment I arrived.

126
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,556
Tyrion: They're afraid.

127
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,142
Anyone who resists Cersei
will see his family butchered.

128
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,353
You can't expect them to be heroes.

129
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,647
- They're hostages.
- They are.

130
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,984
In a tyrant's grip.
Whose fault is that? Mine?

131
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,737
What does it matter whose fault it is?

132
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,656
Thousands of children will die
if the city burns.

133
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,076
Your sister knows how to use
her enemies' weaknesses against them.

134
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,704
That's what she thinks our mercy is:

135
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,830
Weakness.

136
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,707
- I beg you, my queen...
- But she's wrong.

137
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,627
Mercy is our strength.

138
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,339
Our mercy towards future generations

139
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,799
who will never again
be held hostage by a tyrant.

140
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,891
Ready the unsullied.

141
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,369
Tonight you sail for king's landing
to join the northern armies.

142
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,063
Cersei's followers will abandon her
if they know the war is lost.

143
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,314
Give them that chance.

144
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,732
(Inhales sharply)

145
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,652
If the city surrenders, they will
ring the bells and raise the gates.

146
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:11,113
Please, if you hear them ringing
the bells, call off the attack.

147
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,768
Daenerys: Wait for me
outside the city.

148
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,377
You'll know when it's time.

149
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:35,179
(Breathes deeply)

150
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,493
Daenerys: Your brother was stopped
trying to get past our lines.

151
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,585
It seems he hasn't abandoned
your sister after all.

152
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,050
The next time you fail me...

153
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,846
Will be the last time you fail me.

154
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:31,902
(Door opens, then closes)

155
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,738
(People chattering indistinctly)

156
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,114
Guard 1: Let them pass.

157
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,991
(Baby crying)

158
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,377
Guard 2: Through the gate.

159
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,962
Guard 3: Get going.

160
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,754
(People chattering indistinctly)

161
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,632
Davos: The rearguard
should be here by daybreak.

162
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,592
Tyrion: She wants to attack now.

163
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,346
Daybreak at the earliest.

164
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,724
Soldier 1: Careful with that.
Soldier 2: My lord.

165
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,020
Tyrion: Davos.

166
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,817
I need to ask you a favor.

167
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,613
You're the greatest smuggler alive,
aren't you?

168
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,409
I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?

169
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,246
Soldier 1: He's always better
when he's got some food in him.

170
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,249
Soldier 2: Problem is
when he's got drink in him.

171
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,261
- See what he did the other week?
- Soldier 1: Aye. Fighting as well.

172
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,923
Ay up. Where you going?

173
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,343
I'm Arya stark.

174
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,595
I'm going to kill queen Cersei.

175
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,312
Think about it.
She kills Cersei, the war's over.

176
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,607
There won't be a siege.
You might not even die tomorrow.

177
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:34,900
(Scoffs)

178
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,141
I need to go talk to my captain.

179
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,781
Go ahead, talk to him.

180
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,910
Soldier 1: Where's he going?

181
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,258
(Speaks valyrian)

182
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,677
I drink to eat the skull keeper.

183
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,099
I want to eat the skull keeper.

184
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,020
(Clears throat)

185
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:15,357
I want to see the...

186
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,241
Unsullied soldier:
We speak the common tongue.

187
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,154
(In English) Ah. Good.

188
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,864
I want to be alone with the prisoner.

189
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,492
Get some rest.
Tomorrow will be a long day.

190
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:26,595
Unsullied soldier:
We have orders to guard the prisoner.

191
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,287
Ordered by whom? The queen herself?

192
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:30,498
Unsullied soldier: No.

193
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,458
Well, in that case,
as hand of the queen,

194
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,418
I outrank whomever gave your order.

195
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,128
Probably by quite a lot.

196
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,695
How did they find you?

197
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,456
Did you consider taking it off?

198
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,378
Cersei once called me
"the stupidest Lannister."

199
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,174
You're going back to her,
to die with her.

200
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,802
You've underestimated her before.

201
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,387
She's going to die.

202
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,724
Unless you can convince her
to change her course of action.

203
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,768
Difficult to do from here.

204
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,064
(Exhales sharply)

205
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:41,402
When have I ever been able
to convince Cersei of anything?

206
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,573
If not for yourself, if not for her,

207
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:48,033
then for every one
of the million people in that city,

208
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,535
innocent or othennise.

209
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,538
To be honest,
I never really cared much for them.

210
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,331
Innocent or othennise.

211
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,668
You do care for one innocent.

212
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,170
I know you do.

213
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:01,755
And so does Cersei.

214
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,009
She has a reason now.

215
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:10,097
The child is the reason
she'll never give an inch.

216
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,934
All the worst things she's ever done,
she's done for her children.

217
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,770
It's not impossible that she'll win.

218
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,188
She won't.

219
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,609
Her enemy's forces have been depleted,
as she said they would be.

220
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,320
Two of the three dragons are dead.

221
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,572
- She's evened the odds.
- The city will fall tomorrow.

222
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,616
She has the Lannister army,
the golden company...

223
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,534
I defended the city
last time it was attacked.

224
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,995
I know it better than anyone.
It will fall tomorrow.

225
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,205
Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow,
if not before.

226
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,757
Escape.

227
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,842
The two of you, together.

228
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,636
Remember where we met,

229
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:51,013
where they keep the dragon skulls,
beneath the red keep?

230
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,058
Take her down there.

231
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,186
Keep following the stainnays down,
down as far as they'll go.

232
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,605
You'll come out onto a beach
at the foot of the keep.

233
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,106
A dinghy will be waiting for you.

234
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,318
Sail out of the bay.

235
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,071
If the winds are kind,
you'll make it to pentos.

236
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,032
Start a new life.

237
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:17,790
Sail right past the iron fleet
and into a new life?

238
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,084
Sounds a lot less likely
than Cersei winning this war.

239
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,628
There won't be an iron fleet
for much longer.

240
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,422
Do it.

241
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:28,300
If you don't,
you'll never see Cersei again.

242
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,599
Swear to me.

243
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,896
You have my word.

244
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,528
If it works,

245
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:51,407
give the order to ring all the bells
in king's landing and open the gates.

246
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,610
That will be our signal
that the city has surrendered.

247
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:59,415
I never thought
I'd get to repay the favor.

248
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,959
Remember, ring the bells
and open the gates.

249
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,586
Your queen will execute you for this.

250
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,150
If Daenerys can make it to the throne

251
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,298
without wading through
a river of blood,

252
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:11,260
maybe she'll show mercy
to the person who made that possible.

253
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,602
Tens of thousands of innocent lives...

254
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,690
One not particularly innocent dwarf...

255
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,652
It seems like a fair trade.

256
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,578
If it weren't for you,

257
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,663
I never would've survived
my childhood.

258
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,167
(Softly) You would have.

259
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,010
You were the only one

260
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,930
who didn't treat me like a monster.

261
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,310
You were all I had.

262
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:08,859
(Whimpers)

263
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,654
(Tyrion sobbing)

264
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,493
(Sniffles)

265
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,341
Soldier 1: Eyes on the horizon!

266
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:17,803
Soldier 2: Load the scorpion!

267
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,389
(Soldiers shouting indistinctly)

268
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,060
(Grunting)

269
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,026
Soldier 3: Archers, close up!

270
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:36,655
Soldier 4: Up to the espringal!

271
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,448
Soldier 5: To the back of it!

272
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,546
Soldier 6: Archers, line up!

273
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,344
(People clamoring)

274
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,306
Woman: This way! Come on!

275
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,807
Soldier 1: Clear the streets now!

276
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:06,185
- Woman: No!
- In, now.

277
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,437
- And you, come on.
- Soldier 2: Inside, now!

278
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,314
Man 1: Quickly.

279
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,233
Yes. Follow down there.
They're here. Get to the red keep.

280
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:15,117
- (Baby crying)
- (Mother speaks indistinctly)

281
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:16,862
Father: My son!
Soldier 1: Get inside!

282
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,243
Man 2: Just ahead of you,
I can see it!

283
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:24,828
Soldier 1: All right, move it!

284
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,663
Woman: Come on!
Soldier 2: Keep moving!

285
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,266
Soldier 3: Keep going!
Soldier 2: Keep moving!

286
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,375
Soldier 3: Quickly!
Soldier 2: All the way!

287
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,710
Man 3: Come on! Man 4: Come on!

288
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,643
Soldier 4: Keep moving!

289
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:51,021
Soldier 5: Make way
for the golden company!

290
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,365
Soldier 6: Close the gate!

291
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,098
If you hear the bells ring,
they've surrendered.

292
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,517
Call off your men.

293
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,115
Soldier: Move along now, lads.

294
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,438
Soldier 1: That's it.
Soldier 2: Go on, move it.

295
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,362
Come on, move, move. Faster, faster.
Come on, move it.

296
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,364
- Keep going.
- Soldier 2: Keep moving.

297
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,240
(People chattering indistinctly)

298
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,370
- Move.
- Soldier 1: Stay with him.

299
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,331
Man: Hold on.
Woman: Hold my hand.

300
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,499
Nora: Get behind her.

301
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,209
Soldier 3: Close the gate!

302
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:24,925
- No.
- No, mommy.

303
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,886
- Girl: -Let me in! Please!
- No, please, sir!

304
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,097
Man 1: Open the gate!
Soldier 1: Close the gate!

305
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,224
Man 2: Open it!
Man 3: Open the gate!

306
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:36,061
- Soldier 2: Get back.
- Look, go over there. Go. Go.

307
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,313
- (Soldiers grunting)
- (People clamoring)

308
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,860
Soldier 3: The gates are locked now!

309
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:47,531
Woman: Open! Open the gate!

310
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,992
Jaime: Soldier! Soldier!

311
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,370
- Man 4: Please open the gate!
- Go back to your homes!

312
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,955
Stay back! It's closed!

313
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,498
Soldier!

314
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,918
Soldier 1: Move away! Stop!

315
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,503
Man 5: Let us in!

316
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,091
Man 6: We're not leaving!

317
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,479
(People clamoring in distance)

318
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,408
(Wind whistling)

319
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,824
(Screeching)

320
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,369
Turn!

321
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:31,551
(Roars)

322
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,352
- Turn it around!
- Soldier: Turn it around!

323
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,730
Euron: Get back! Back!

324
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,237

Soldier 1: Ready!

330
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,345
Move!

331
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,682
Fire!

332
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,896
- Reload!
- Soldier 2: Reload!

333
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,648
Faster!

334
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,899
Hurry!

335
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,947
(Screaming)

336
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,075
(Screaming)

337
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,243

- (Sword rings)

471

They'll sing about you forever.

473

You're no king.

Oh, but I am.

Your grace, it isn't safe here
any longer.

492
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,790
The red keep is the safest place
in the city.

493
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:10,085
The unsullied have breached
the gates of the red keep.

494
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:23,182
Maegor's holdfast would be
a better place to wait out the storm.

- (Flesh squelching)
- (Euron yells)

506
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:50,602

508
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:06,827

(Drogon roars)

516
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:45,991
Go home, girl.

517
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:50,537
The fire will get her,
or one of the Dothraki.

518
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,665
Or maybe that dragon will eat her.

519
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,251
It doesn't matter. She's dead.

520
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:59,421
And you'll be dead too
if you don't get out of here.

521
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:01,882
I'm going to kill her.

522
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:06,345
You think you wanted revenge
a long time?

523
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,055
I've been after it all my life.

524
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,307
It's all I care about.

525
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,434
And look at me. Look at me!

526
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:14,019
(Breathing heavily)

527
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,480
You wanna be like me?

528
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:27,324
You come with me, you die here.

529
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:42,798
