1
00:00:22,444 --> 00:00:24,029
Good morning.

2
00:00:24,696 --> 00:00:26,114
Good morning, Mum.

3
00:00:27,824 --> 00:00:30,994
- Your cat bit me again.
- You stole my pencils.

4
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,788
- Why are you fighting?
- Because he stole my pencils!

5
00:00:32,913 --> 00:00:34,331
- She's making it up.
- Stop fighting.

6
00:00:34,456 --> 00:00:38,168
- Let's see.
- Let's go, sweetie. What time is it?

7
00:00:38,293 --> 00:00:41,046
- 6:40a.m.
- God, I'm late again.

8
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:44,299
Remember to ask your brother
what we talked about.

9
00:00:44,424 --> 00:00:48,136
- Tell him school starts next week.
- Yes. I'll ask him, all right?

10
00:00:48,262 --> 00:00:51,098
I still have to buy the books, everything.

11
00:00:51,223 --> 00:00:53,517
I told you I'll ask him, my love,
all right?

12
00:00:53,642 --> 00:00:58,355
And you still haven't tied your shoes.
80, like I taught you, right?

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,858
We have the rabbit ear,
we go around the tree, and...?

14
00:01:01,984 --> 00:01:03,318
And it goes in the hole.

15
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:10,534
That was a loud one.

16
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,747
LUIS LODOÑO WHITE,
SERVILE FRONT MAN

17
00:01:56,872 --> 00:01:58,206
AND INITIATOR OF KIDNAPPINGS
FOR PABLO ESCOBAR

18
00:02:05,964 --> 00:02:07,382
Sit him there.

19
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:10,344
Over here.

20
00:02:22,648 --> 00:02:24,483
Look at that ugly son of a bitch.

21
00:02:30,864 --> 00:02:33,909
One... two... and three.

22
00:04:09,921 --> 00:04:12,758
This family is the only thing
I care about.

23
00:04:12,883 --> 00:04:16,219
- You're the one that...
- Me? Me, ma'am? Me?

24
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:19,556
- We shouldn't leave, Tata.
- All of this is your fault.

25
00:04:20,015 --> 00:04:22,893
If you'd listened to Pablo,
my brother would still be alive.

26
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:28,482
Because you do that so well?
Do you listen to him?

27
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:34,821
When you're always criticising him,
doubting him, worrying.

28
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:47,250
I would never put this family in danger.

29
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,086
Tell her, Pablo.

30
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,298
Tell her it's not my fault, Pablo.

31
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:57,844
- I know, Mom.
- This isn't my fault. Tell her, Pablo.

32
00:04:57,969 --> 00:05:02,516
It's not your fault. I know.
It's not your fault.

33
00:05:05,435 --> 00:05:07,479
Everything's all right, Mum.

34
00:05:08,814 --> 00:05:10,398
It wasn't your fault.

35
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:20,677
Look at these smiling faces.

36
00:06:20,802 --> 00:06:23,013
We didn't want to make you
uncomfortable, Judy.

37
00:06:23,138 --> 00:06:28,143
How considerate of you.
So that's why no one called me?

38
00:06:29,394 --> 00:06:31,938
Because this lab belongs
to the Moncadas.

39
00:06:33,023 --> 00:06:36,735
So I was supposed to be notified
when it was taken back.

40
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,989
- That wasn't made clear to us.
- I'm making it clear now, Carlos.

41
00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:45,869
- What are we going to do with that?
- All the cocaine is going to Cali.

42
00:06:45,994 --> 00:06:48,163
That is my cocaine.

43
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:53,710
Look, Judy, we decided that not a single
kilo of cocaine will be moved in Medellin

44
00:06:53,835 --> 00:06:56,588
until Pablo Escobar is dead.

45
00:06:56,713 --> 00:07:00,050
That's our strategy. To asphyxiate him.

46
00:07:00,175 --> 00:07:04,012
That's the Cali cartel's strategy?

47
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:06,640
To keep making money
while the rest of us go hungry?

48
00:07:06,765 --> 00:07:11,770
- You know we can't trust them.
- No. Not them or any of you.

49
00:07:12,437 --> 00:07:16,399
We don't trust any drug trafficker.

50
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:23,782
Well, let's not get personal, Carlos.
All right?

51
00:07:24,407 --> 00:07:26,201
We all need friends.

52
00:07:36,461 --> 00:07:38,713
Sir, would you like some?

53
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,525
Go!

54
00:08:05,824 --> 00:08:07,158
Sir?

55
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:13,123
Are you all right?

56
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:44,029
Are you all right?

57
00:09:11,097 --> 00:09:14,309
- We're done working together.
- What's bothering you?

58
00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:18,271
The killing of innocent civilians,
for starters.

59
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,358
Whether they're innocent or guilty,
I don't decide.

60
00:09:22,484 --> 00:09:24,235
That's what priests are for, no?

61
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:35,205
The Castaños are crazier than ever,
and that wasn't part of the plan.

62
00:09:36,623 --> 00:09:38,291
But it's working.

63
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,669
Not if I stop providing you intel.

64
00:09:43,088 --> 00:09:49,344
For what it's worth, I'm on your side.
I don't like what's happening.

65
00:09:49,469 --> 00:09:51,930
Medellin is my home
and I love it very much.

66
00:09:53,932 --> 00:09:56,935
As far as the methods
of the Castaños go,

67
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:02,774
well, those are the methods that
have Pablo's people hiding like rats.

68
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:06,569
Including that gonorrhoea of a lawyer,
Fernando Duque.

69
00:10:06,694 --> 00:10:11,199
Our guys fired a whole fucking clip
at him, point blank.

70
00:10:11,324 --> 00:10:15,537
Can you believe that these sons of bitches
didn't hit him once?

71
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:18,164
I need you to help me find him.

72
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,670
He's Pablo's mouthpiece
and his connection to the government.

73
00:10:23,795 --> 00:10:27,674
What we want is
to exterminate this rat.

74
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:33,555
That way, we'll get to Pablo
and we can end this madness, Peña.

75
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,405
I've told you! You have to...

76
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,826
What are you doing?
You have to bring the passports.

77
00:10:54,951 --> 00:10:58,997
Juliana... they're trying to kill me.
We have to get out of here.

78
00:10:59,122 --> 00:11:02,083
I think you're the one
who needs to leave.

79
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:05,879
Can I see Simon, at least?

80
00:11:06,004 --> 00:11:08,715
- Where... Simon!
- Stop, Fernando!

81
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,758
Simon is at school.

82
00:11:11,885 --> 00:11:17,265
Besides, this isn't even your week.
So, please... leave.

83
00:11:53,384 --> 00:11:55,845
- Oh, what's going on?
- How are you?

84
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,388
- Bye, Anda!
- Bye!

85
00:11:57,513 --> 00:12:00,391
Where's Mum?
Why do you have her car?

86
00:12:01,184 --> 00:12:02,352
Get in.

87
00:12:21,955 --> 00:12:23,039
Come in.

88
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:29,003
Go on, son. Sit down.

89
00:12:30,672 --> 00:12:33,341
So, you're being reassigned.

90
00:12:34,384 --> 00:12:38,263
You will be moved into the intel unit
that was formed a couple of months ago.

91
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:42,892
You'll be all right there.

92
00:12:44,936 --> 00:12:48,439
You're sending me to an office
because I made a mistake?

93
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:51,985
Anything else?

94
00:12:59,534 --> 00:13:01,119
Yes, sir, Colonel.

95
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:23,349
How are you, Papa?

96
00:13:27,895 --> 00:13:29,355
And you?

97
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,484
- How long will we be there?
- Not long.

98
00:13:34,986 --> 00:13:38,740
Just long enough for me
to get some things figured out here.

99
00:13:43,786 --> 00:13:46,706
Do you remember when we went
to the United States?

100
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,918
It's going to be an adventure,
just like that.

101
00:13:51,044 --> 00:13:52,879
Do they have Disney World there?

102
00:13:56,507 --> 00:13:58,343
I don't think so.

103
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:18,237
Listen to your mother
and your grandmother. All right?

104
00:14:21,282 --> 00:14:24,827
I made more than one reservation
so no one will know what flight you're on.

105
00:14:25,703 --> 00:14:28,623
I spoke to Fernando
and he said it's perfectly legal.

106
00:14:28,748 --> 00:14:32,668
You have every right
to leave the country.

107
00:14:32,794 --> 00:14:36,297
- It's like a normal trip.
- A normal trip?

108
00:14:43,888 --> 00:14:47,975
Confess. Do you regret it?

109
00:14:48,101 --> 00:14:50,395
Marrying me, or what?

110
00:14:51,437 --> 00:14:52,730
Not for a second.

111
00:15:04,992 --> 00:15:06,994
They may separate us...

112
00:15:09,205 --> 00:15:12,542
...but they'll never be able
to destroy us.

113
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:22,969
Go.

114
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:36,899
The little bunny.

115
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:39,193
I'll take care of him, all right?

116
00:15:40,027 --> 00:15:41,487
Give me a kiss.

117
00:20:22,226 --> 00:20:25,229
Sergeant. Private Hugo Martinez Jr.
at your service, sir.

118
00:20:32,528 --> 00:20:33,863
The colonel's son.

119
00:20:36,907 --> 00:20:38,993
He said you have some
technical background.

120
00:20:40,995 --> 00:20:43,581
I took a couple
of engineering classes, sir.

121
00:20:44,123 --> 00:20:47,251
And I built a ham in my parents' house.

122
00:20:48,294 --> 00:20:52,381
Great. What do you know about RDF?

123
00:20:55,718 --> 00:20:57,344
The basic concept, sir.

124
00:20:58,763 --> 00:21:00,181
The basic concept.

125
00:21:04,018 --> 00:21:05,144
All right.

126
00:21:06,604 --> 00:21:09,982
Get acquainted.
We go out tomorrow afternoon.

127
00:21:10,107 --> 00:21:11,609
And don't worry.

128
00:21:11,734 --> 00:21:15,780
Unlike Carlos Castaño,
this won't hit back.

129
00:21:31,128 --> 00:21:33,756
What's going on?
I'm gonna freeze to death out here.

130
00:21:33,881 --> 00:21:35,424
That's Bogotà. What do you expect?

131
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:39,845
Hey! What the fuck is wrong with you?
Why are you not working?

132
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,181
Get to work.
I'm not paying you with candy.

133
00:21:42,306 --> 00:21:44,934
- Okay, okay.
- Pass me the phone, boy.

134
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:48,687
Make some fucking bombs.
You need an invitation to start working?

135
00:21:50,105 --> 00:21:53,609
Hurry, boy! You get to work too!

136
00:21:53,734 --> 00:21:55,653
And don't smoke near the gunpowder.

137
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:05,079
Hey, boss.
I just came back from the airport.

138
00:22:05,204 --> 00:22:08,958
<i>Miss Tata, the kids and your mother
are on the plane, boss.</i>

139
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,876
Thank the Virgin Mary.

140
00:22:12,378 --> 00:22:15,714
That's the most important thing.
They're flying now.

141
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,299
<i>One more thing.</i>

142
00:22:17,424 --> 00:22:20,302
We hit those fucking drugstores
pretty hard.

143
00:22:20,427 --> 00:22:23,013
You tell us.
Should we come home or...?

144
00:22:23,138 --> 00:22:26,976
<i>No. Stay put. We're not done yet.</i>

145
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:29,019
<i>I may need you again.</i>

146
00:22:29,603 --> 00:22:31,272
<i>Copy that, boss.</i>

147
00:22:31,397 --> 00:22:32,982
Thank you, Blackie.

148
00:22:45,953 --> 00:22:50,291
Figure out... what time it is in Germany.

149
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,294
On it, boss.

150
00:23:04,847 --> 00:23:06,307
Boss!

151
00:23:11,061 --> 00:23:12,396
Boss!

152
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:24,760
<i>Peña.</i>

153
00:24:25,386 --> 00:24:27,763
Any word on our friend?

154
00:24:27,888 --> 00:24:29,473
<i>Did you find him?</i>

155
00:24:32,685 --> 00:24:35,479
- <i>Peña?</i>
- Not yet.

156
00:25:33,829 --> 00:25:35,330
What's up, Peña?

157
00:25:36,457 --> 00:25:38,417
Are we getting a beer or what?

158
00:25:40,377 --> 00:25:41,920
Another day, brother.

159
00:25:43,464 --> 00:25:45,049
See you tomorrow.

160
00:25:59,146 --> 00:26:00,606
No. What are you doing, Simon?

161
00:26:00,731 --> 00:26:04,151
Leave it where it is.
I'm listening to the news.

162
00:26:05,277 --> 00:26:07,446
What are we doing here?

163
00:26:07,571 --> 00:26:10,032
I told you. We're going on a trip.

164
00:26:10,532 --> 00:26:12,576
And what's happening?
Where's my mum?

165
00:26:13,827 --> 00:26:17,039
Simon... calm down.
I already spoke to your mother.

166
00:26:17,164 --> 00:26:19,500
You got yourself into trouble,
didn't you?

167
00:26:21,335 --> 00:26:24,254
It's because you work for Pablo Escobar.

168
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:27,216
That's why this is happening.

169
00:26:32,137 --> 00:26:33,806
You're his lawyer.

170
00:26:36,391 --> 00:26:38,393
What are we going to do now?

171
00:26:40,062 --> 00:26:42,606
I have a plan. Calm down.

172
00:26:43,482 --> 00:26:47,820
You don't have a plan, Dad.
You're a son of a bitch. A fucking thief.

173
00:26:48,862 --> 00:26:52,241
Did you say "son of a bitch"? "Thief"?

174
00:26:53,283 --> 00:26:57,079
I'm a lawyer. I'm a good lawyer.

175
00:26:58,455 --> 00:27:02,417
All the money this family has,
we have because I've been a good lawyer.

176
00:27:02,543 --> 00:27:05,587
- I do my job.
- I want to call my mum.

177
00:27:05,712 --> 00:27:07,756
You want to call your mum?

178
00:27:07,881 --> 00:27:11,260
Do you want to call your mum,
or do you want to behave like a man?

179
00:27:11,385 --> 00:27:15,097
Are you going to be a pussy
and call your mum? That's a great idea.

180
00:27:15,222 --> 00:27:18,684
Let's call her so she can tell you where
all the money for your toys came from.

181
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:22,521
Your room full of toys.
Where do you think it came from?

182
00:27:24,273 --> 00:27:26,692
You didn't complain during the Christmases
or the birthdays

183
00:27:26,817 --> 00:27:29,027
or when I bought you a motorcycle.

184
00:27:29,153 --> 00:27:32,739
But now you're complaining. Very well!
Very well. It's over.

185
00:27:33,866 --> 00:27:37,578
It's over! Now that they're
going to kill me, it's over.

186
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:51,341
I'm sorry... Simon.

187
00:27:53,385 --> 00:27:55,304
I didn't mean to say that.

188
00:27:55,429 --> 00:27:56,638
Forgive me.

189
00:27:57,931 --> 00:28:00,893
Everything will be all right.
Forgive me.

190
00:28:17,284 --> 00:28:19,286
Was it a heart attack or what?

191
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:20,787
You fainted, Pablo.

192
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:26,835
How many of those are you taking?

193
00:28:28,879 --> 00:28:31,590
I've had a terrible headache.

194
00:28:31,715 --> 00:28:34,343
Those aren't any good, Pablo.

195
00:28:34,468 --> 00:28:37,137
You shouldn't put so much shit
in your body.

196
00:28:39,473 --> 00:28:44,645
You're better off... taking these drops.
They're homeopathic.

197
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:48,065
Three drops under your tongue
in the morning and two at night.

198
00:28:57,741 --> 00:28:59,785
Have you ever been to Disney World?

199
00:29:01,036 --> 00:29:02,329
I haven't.

200
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:06,250
It's beautiful.

201
00:29:08,126 --> 00:29:11,296
It's very organised. Very clean.

202
00:29:15,425 --> 00:29:17,427
What's wrong with me, Ricardo?

203
00:29:18,637 --> 00:29:19,972
Stress.

204
00:29:22,057 --> 00:29:23,600
Stress is dangerous.

205
00:29:24,268 --> 00:29:26,186
How's the weed working out?

206
00:29:27,562 --> 00:29:30,148
I haven't been smoking a lot.

207
00:29:31,733 --> 00:29:36,697
The first man who smoked marijuana
was a Chinese emperor.

208
00:29:36,822 --> 00:29:40,909
He burned the plant because
he was attracted to its smell.

209
00:29:41,034 --> 00:29:44,621
But when he inhaled the smoke,
he saw a blue jay.

210
00:29:46,748 --> 00:29:51,461
And the bird told him
to conquer his neighbouring empires.

211
00:29:51,586 --> 00:29:53,171
And that's what he did.

212
00:29:57,592 --> 00:29:58,635
All right.

213
00:30:00,595 --> 00:30:02,931
With you until death, Don Pablo.

214
00:30:04,057 --> 00:30:05,392
Thank you.

215
00:30:07,352 --> 00:30:10,689
I'd like to stay and stand guard.

216
00:30:15,193 --> 00:30:18,071
All right. Thank you.

217
00:30:33,211 --> 00:30:36,965
Let's see, darling.
Colour inside the lines.

218
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,968
There it is.

219
00:31:20,467 --> 00:31:22,719
This is our stop.

220
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:43,550
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

221
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:47,304
- What's going on?
- Can you give me back my passport?

222
00:32:53,935 --> 00:32:55,479
That money is ours.

223
00:33:01,026 --> 00:33:04,571
- <i>Pablo, they're not letting us in.</i>
- No, no! They can't do that.

224
00:33:04,696 --> 00:33:07,324
- <i>That's what they're doing.</i>
- They can't...

225
00:33:07,449 --> 00:33:11,578
Listen, Tata, that's illegal.
That's illegal. Don't worry.

226
00:33:11,703 --> 00:33:12,913
<i>Don't worry, because...</i>

227
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:17,042
Do what you need to do to get us
into Germany. I have to hang up.

228
00:33:17,918 --> 00:33:22,088
Don't touch me! I'm asking you
not to touch me. Let go!

229
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,387
No!

230
00:34:16,184 --> 00:34:17,936
Fernando Duque.

231
00:34:19,145 --> 00:34:20,438
Javier Peña.

232
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,317
It took me one day to find you.

233
00:34:24,442 --> 00:34:28,196
If you don't want them to kill you,
you need to start doing things better.

234
00:34:31,533 --> 00:34:34,911
Please... get me out of here.

235
00:34:35,537 --> 00:34:38,915
Please get me out of Colombia.
You know who I work for... worked for?

236
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:41,668
Well, our help isn't free.

237
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:46,423
We need full cooperation.

238
00:34:47,716 --> 00:34:48,967
Dad!

239
00:34:49,843 --> 00:34:52,304
Hey, Simon, it's all right.

240
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:56,266
It's all right. Go back inside.
I'll come up soon.

241
00:34:59,352 --> 00:35:04,024
It's my son. He's... He's scared.

242
00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:07,902
First, we'll get you to Holguin.
You'll be safe...

243
00:35:08,028 --> 00:35:11,656
No! No, we're staying here.

244
00:35:11,781 --> 00:35:15,952
There are cops working
for Los PEPES everywhere.

245
00:35:17,537 --> 00:35:21,541
It would be better if you get us
to the United States at once.

246
00:35:23,585 --> 00:35:26,379
I'll cooperate with you.
Anything you want.

247
00:35:26,504 --> 00:35:29,132
I'll cooperate with you.
Please get us out of Colombia.

248
00:35:30,008 --> 00:35:31,635
Is that a deal?

249
00:35:37,474 --> 00:35:39,225
Do as I say.

250
00:35:39,351 --> 00:35:43,313
Start by hiding your fucking wife's car.

251
00:36:05,835 --> 00:36:08,338
Hello, German embassy.

252
00:36:08,463 --> 00:36:13,843
First of all, I'll kill every last German
son of a bitch that lives in Colombia.

253
00:36:13,968 --> 00:36:18,098
Then I will bomb Frankfurt, Munich...

254
00:36:21,267 --> 00:36:26,064
<i>I'm going to shove bombs up your asses,
you bastard motherfuckers.</i>

255
00:36:26,189 --> 00:36:30,944
Nazi, racist gonorrhoeas.
I'm going to kill all of you. You hear?

256
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:32,946
I'm going to kill all of you!

257
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:07,147
I once heard you say that I had the same
rights as any other Colombian citizen.

258
00:37:08,857 --> 00:37:11,860
I imagine that also applies
to my family, correct?

259
00:37:12,569 --> 00:37:16,281
<i>The government hasn't done anything
to stop Los PEPES.</i>

260
00:37:16,406 --> 00:37:21,035
Those terrorists have attacked
my family and murdered my associates.

261
00:37:21,161 --> 00:37:26,332
Is that how the Colombian government
ensures the rights of all its citizens?

262
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:30,920
<i>The president is trying to prevent
my family from entering Germany</i>

263
00:37:31,045 --> 00:37:32,547
<i>and yet you do nothing about it.</i>

264
00:37:32,672 --> 00:37:38,011
That man wants to dangle my family before
Los PEPES and use my children as bait,

265
00:37:38,136 --> 00:37:41,973
and you, who call yourself a man
of principle, do nothing about it!

266
00:37:59,741 --> 00:38:02,035
There's a lot of interference.

267
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,413
Yes. Medellin has too many
electrical wires, phone wires, antennae.

268
00:38:05,538 --> 00:38:08,541
- That must be why.
- What's your success rate?

269
00:38:09,876 --> 00:38:11,920
To be honest,
we haven't located a signal yet.

270
00:38:12,587 --> 00:38:13,797
Not one?

271
00:38:14,631 --> 00:38:15,882
Not one.

272
00:38:23,014 --> 00:38:25,058
Here's what we're going to do, Morales.

273
00:38:25,183 --> 00:38:30,855
Let's both start here: L9.329.

274
00:38:32,398 --> 00:38:33,858
There it is.

275
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:46,871
I was talking to my police contact and
you won't guess who's hiding the lawyer.

276
00:38:48,957 --> 00:38:52,669
None other than that son of a bitch, Peña.
What do you think about that?

277
00:38:54,003 --> 00:38:55,880
Who's your contact?

278
00:38:56,005 --> 00:39:00,343
Who he is isn't important.
The important thing is that I trust him.

279
00:39:01,427 --> 00:39:03,930
Know what the worst part of this is?

280
00:39:04,055 --> 00:39:06,140
We can no longer trust Peña.

281
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:09,102
Then we'll have to put a bullet in him.

282
00:39:10,812 --> 00:39:12,355
No.

283
00:39:13,231 --> 00:39:16,067
We can't kill DEA agents.

284
00:39:16,192 --> 00:39:18,152
Oh, no? Why not?

285
00:39:21,197 --> 00:39:24,242
If it were up to me,
I'd feed him to the crocodiles.

286
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,787
Berna, look...

287
00:39:34,335 --> 00:39:39,632
Schedule a meeting with Peña,
just as you have been.

288
00:39:40,842 --> 00:39:42,468
We'll take care of the rest.

289
00:43:34,992 --> 00:43:37,578
COURTESY OF LOS PEPES

290
00:43:41,082 --> 00:43:44,544
Córdoba recovers,
we'll have a goalie in place.

291
00:43:44,669 --> 00:43:48,256
Leonel Alvarez can do his thing
and move the ball along.

292
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:57,473
Did you follow me to the hotel?
You told Berna?

293
00:43:58,766 --> 00:43:59,934
Let go.

294
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:01,853
Tell me, asshole.

295
00:44:02,562 --> 00:44:04,397
- Let go! It's all right.
- What's the problem?

296
00:44:04,522 --> 00:44:07,233
I'll catch up. Everything's fine.

297
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,528
What's going on, Peña?

298
00:44:12,738 --> 00:44:14,574
Playing the fucking American?

299
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,244
Did you see what they did to his son?

300
00:44:20,288 --> 00:44:24,125
How many families has Pablo Escobar
destroyed, Peña? Do you know?

301
00:44:26,711 --> 00:44:29,130
You don't decide who lives and who dies.

302
00:44:29,255 --> 00:44:33,384
Don't be fucking stupid.
This is how we do it.

303
00:45:00,369 --> 00:45:05,625
<i>I understand that you're trying
to prevent Escobar's family</i>

304
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,168
<i>from entering Germany.</i>

305
00:45:07,293 --> 00:45:09,003
Let's make something clear.

306
00:45:09,128 --> 00:45:13,674
If you've come to plead for them
as part of some deal, the only...

307
00:45:13,799 --> 00:45:15,551
No, Mr President.

308
00:45:16,469 --> 00:45:23,434
I haven't come to plead for them.
I've come to plead for you.

309
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:27,688
For me? How so?

310
00:45:27,813 --> 00:45:31,067
I know that you want Escobar dead.

311
00:45:32,068 --> 00:45:36,447
And while I don't agree with that,
I understand it.

312
00:45:37,448 --> 00:45:41,702
But this... this I can't understand.

313
00:45:42,578 --> 00:45:45,748
This isn't just wrong.

314
00:45:45,873 --> 00:45:52,672
It puts you, the president of Colombia,
in league with a death squad.

315
00:45:54,090 --> 00:46:00,304
Call the German chancellor.
Tell him to let the family in.

316
00:46:19,573 --> 00:46:23,869
Mrs Escobar, I'm sorry to inform you that
your entry into Germany has been denied.

317
00:46:26,914 --> 00:46:29,500
I know my rights, sir.
But you don't understand.

318
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:32,795
My children are in danger.
Send me any place other than Colombia.

319
00:46:33,879 --> 00:46:39,510
Tell him the children are under age.
We just want to live in peace...

320
00:46:40,678 --> 00:46:46,350
No.
Tell him that's all we want to do.

321
00:46:46,475 --> 00:46:48,644
To live in peace.

322
00:46:49,562 --> 00:46:52,064
Get the children and your belongs.

323
00:46:52,857 --> 00:46:54,275
Please.

324
00:46:58,988 --> 00:47:02,575
They kick us out of the country and
on top of everything, they keep the money.

325
00:47:03,534 --> 00:47:05,536
I know. I'm going.

326
00:47:05,661 --> 00:47:08,664
What's this?
Why are we being treated this way?

327
00:47:11,042 --> 00:47:12,293
Let's go.

328
00:48:54,228 --> 00:48:55,646
Pardon me.

329
00:48:56,981 --> 00:48:58,899
I hope you enjoyed Germany.

330
00:49:21,213 --> 00:49:23,466
- How much for this?
- Two thousand pesos.

331
00:49:25,843 --> 00:49:27,136
Thank you.

332
00:50:03,756 --> 00:50:05,466
Ladies.

333
00:50:11,222 --> 00:50:12,890
Stop! National police!

334
00:50:16,268 --> 00:50:19,021
It's all right, ma'am, we're with
the national police. Come with us.

335
00:50:19,146 --> 00:50:21,774
The attorney general asked us
to put you under protective custody.

336
00:50:21,899 --> 00:50:25,694
Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
Come with us. You'll be safe. Let's go.

337
00:50:25,819 --> 00:50:29,323
- Come with us.
- Let's go. Quickly. Let's go!

338
00:50:54,932 --> 00:50:56,350
How can I help you, boss?

339
00:50:58,686 --> 00:51:02,481
I want this faggot of a president
to know what happens

340
00:51:02,606 --> 00:51:06,402
when you're on the side
of those bastards, Los PEPES.

341
00:51:08,529 --> 00:51:12,700
I want to see blood.

342
00:51:14,493 --> 00:51:17,746
<i>I want the sky to burn with gunpowder.</i>

343
00:51:19,373 --> 00:51:22,751
I want you to put the biggest bomb
you can get your hands on

344
00:51:22,876 --> 00:51:26,297
as close as you can
to the Presidential Palace. Are we clear?

345
00:51:27,923 --> 00:51:29,800
As you wish, boss.

346
00:52:59,932 --> 00:53:02,559
My love, let's go. Let's go.

347
00:53:06,689 --> 00:53:10,275
Do you want one? Yes? How much?

348
00:53:10,401 --> 00:53:11,610
One hundred pesos.

349
00:53:13,362 --> 00:53:15,364
- Here.
- Thank you.

350
00:53:17,908 --> 00:53:20,244
- Are we going that way?
- That way, darling.

351
00:53:21,286 --> 00:53:25,082
You better be a doctor when you grow up.
This is very expensive.

352
00:53:25,207 --> 00:53:27,710
Elena! Elena, let's go!

353
00:54:32,566 --> 00:54:34,276
Lift him up carefully!
