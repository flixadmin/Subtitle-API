1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,130
THE ORIGIN

2
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:05,083
We're attracted to the
dark like moths to light.

3
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,914
We are born out of the darkness

4
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,926
and we return to it.

5
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,246
You've grown, Tronte.

6
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,431
Do we know each other?

7
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,810
I knew your mother.

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,030
But that was a long time ago.

9
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,040
You take after her.

10
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:48,081
Your eyes.

11
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:50,158
Who are you?

12
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,683
I don't have a name.

13
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,348
I was never given one.

14
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,625
But I chose your name back then.

15
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,383
It belonged to your mother.

16
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,928
I think it should belong to you now.

17
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,190
I have to go now.

18
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,191
I love you.

19
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,486
I don't know if you'll like it, but...

20
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,440
may I put it on you?

21
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,039
You don't like it?

22
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,341
No, I...

23
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,541
I do, it's very beautiful.

24
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,045
I don't know.

25
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,956
I haven't felt quite right all week.

26
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,578
You look pale.

27
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,648
Maybe you should see a doctor.

28
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,815
Will I see you later?

29
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,418
I... I don't know. It's...

30
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,173
I think it's best if
I stay home tonight.

31
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,533
Katharina...

32
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,625
I'm glad you decided to stay here.

33
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,650
In Winden.

34
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,295
You're beautiful.

35
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:04,914
24 SEPTEMBER 1954

36
00:07:05,116 --> 00:07:07,396
SENSATIONAL NUDE PHOTOS

37
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,620
Her facial expression...

38
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,550
KESS
THE EXHILARATING MAGAZINE

39
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,886
Where did you get it?

40
00:07:17,008 --> 00:07:18,605
I found it in my dad's stuff.

41
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:21,178
Ines, Claudia. We're already late.

42
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,873
My dad says you don't
learn anything in school.

43
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,675
You only learn from life.

44
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,039
Why don't they have these with men?

45
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:34,291
- I don't think it's fair at all.
- You're crazy.

46
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,676
Have you ever seen one?

47
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,956
- I mean, that's not your dad's?
- Ines!

48
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,738
Jana, don't be like that.

49
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,163
And what did it look like?

50
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,271
Peculiar.

51
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,426
As if it didn't belong
to the rest of him.

52
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:01,866
Tronte?

53
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,123
I think he's a strange boy.

54
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,735
Is his mother back?

55
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,914
It's odd. Don't you think?

56
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,926
To just disappear like that?

57
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:30,231
POLICE

58
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,700
Doris.

59
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,289
What are you doing here?

60
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:42,248
I want to talk to you.
Mr. Kahnwald let me in.

61
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,920
Where have you been? I thought
you left early to write reports.

62
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,200
It...

63
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,366
I...

64
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,101
Something came up.

65
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,076
This morning...

66
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,391
I did the laundry
and I found something.

67
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:09,789
Here.

68
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:13,001
It was between one of her blouses.
I thought it might help.

69
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,248
She said her husband
was a man of God.

70
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,373
And maybe it's just
a coincidence, but...

71
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,223
the minister who disappeared
at the same time...

72
00:09:40,325 --> 00:09:42,515
His name is Hanno Tauber.

73
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,039
H.T.

74
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,414
WINDEN WELCOMES ITS NEW MINISTER
HANNO TAUBER (42) FROM VECHTA

75
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:50,616
I...

76
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,100
I thought her husband was dead.

77
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,206
It's been 3 months.

78
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:00,628
You don't just leave your
child behind without a word.

79
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,789
You should go home.
We're taking care of it.

80
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,706
Egon! I know something happened.

81
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,348
Why would she leave all this behind?

82
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,266
Who knows what goes on
inside the heads of you women?

83
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,491
Doris!

84
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,414
MISSING SINCE 26 JUNE 1954
MRS. AGNES NIELSEN

85
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,016
HAS ANYONE SEEN THIS WOMAN?

86
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,628
You chose the right side.

87
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,155
Don't forget that.

88
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,164
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN'S BODY
FOUND IN WOODS

89
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,526
You have to give this to Claudia.

90
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,841
When it's time.

91
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,170
Life is a gift...

92
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,703
for those who know how to use it.

93
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,305
Are you going to tell Martha?

94
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,133
What the origin really is?

95
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,300
All of these years, I've wondered...

96
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,978
why you ditched us in 1888.

97
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,581
Why you helped us create the matter...

98
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,240
and then simply disappeared.

99
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,706
Who would've thought
that 33 years later

100
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,258
it would be us who gave you the order.

101
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,446
Magnus...

102
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,661
I'm sorry.

103
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,631
It doesn't matter anymore.

104
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,618
Adam is waiting for us.

105
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:25,825
6 NOVEMBER 2052

106
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,746
This is your future.

107
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,725
33 years away from your yesterday.

108
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,491
The door in the cave...

109
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,816
What is that?

110
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:55,478
It's a path that connects
past and future.

111
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,855
Why are these names crossed out?

112
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,681
It means they die.

113
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,566
All of them.

114
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,328
- What do you mean, they all die?
- In 2 days.

115
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:23,081
The apocalypse in his world

116
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,123
also happens in ours.

117
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,875
This isn't real.

118
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,360
You're not real.

119
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,414
This is your future.

120
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,664
If you...

121
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,956
if both of you fail
to stop the apocalypse.

122
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,838
So you haven't been in Winden long?

123
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,039
3 months.

124
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,711
I like it here.

125
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:08,331
It's much less complicated
than where I'm from.

126
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,813
Well, maybe that's about to change.

127
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,575
You're pregnant.

128
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,706
At your age, a pregnancy
is not without risks.

129
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,478
You should take care of yourself.
No hard work.

130
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,906
That's impossible.

131
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,325
Listen.

132
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,580
Some gifts come into
our lives unexpectedly.

133
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,325
Yet they're still gifts.

134
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,658
Mrs. Doppler.

135
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,831
How can I help you?

136
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,583
I'd like to know if there is any news.

137
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,831
I'm afraid...

138
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,473
I'm afraid not.

139
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:51,164
Unless Helge decides to
tell us where he was...

140
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,706
That is...

141
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,388
whom he was with...

142
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,748
I'm afraid we're stuck.

143
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,770
This isn't about Helge.

144
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,626
This is about the missing minister.

145
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,493
The congregation has been
without support for weeks.

146
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,248
It leaves the door open for the devil.

147
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,266
You knew the man?

148
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,408
The minister?

149
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,191
Did he...

150
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,958
did you ever see him in
the company of a woman?

151
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,540
What are you thinking?

152
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,808
I want you to find the man.

153
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,475
Hanno Tauber.

154
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,711
Sorry to disturb you.

155
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,706
Are you the new minister?

156
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,723
I once was.

157
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,165
But it's been a long time.

158
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,576
The thing is,
I'm looking for someone.

159
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,089
My husband and I,

160
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,907
our daughter is very talented,

161
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:50,623
and last winter we sublet
the guest room

162
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,701
so we could save up money for Claudia,

163
00:18:52,703 --> 00:18:54,164
for when she goes to college.

164
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,331
The woman who moved in with us,

165
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,803
she disappeared, 3 months ago.

166
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,000
Her husband was a man of God.

167
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,664
She said he died.

168
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:10,039
I don't know why, but I got
the impression that wasn't true.

169
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,431
And the man who was the minister here

170
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:14,581
disappeared at the same time, so...

171
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,331
What if he was her husband?

172
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,956
And she went back to him?

173
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,578
I don't think she liked him very much.

174
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,956
Not all human connections

175
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,418
are formed out of fondness.

176
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,373
Well, it's about the boy.

177
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,039
He's still with us, and...

178
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,121
a boy needs his mother.

179
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,888
With every lie

180
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:45,538
the human soul dies just a little bit.

181
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,170
I don't understand.

182
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,748
You're not interested in the boy.

183
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,980
You're interested in the woman.

184
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,373
I think you've
misunderstood me.

185
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,575
The ways of the heart
cannot be explained.

186
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,635
It does what it wants.

187
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,278
Just ask your husband.

188
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,881
He'll tell you the same thing.

189
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,108
My husband?

190
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:28,805
Haven't you wondered why he's been
leaving the house so early lately?

191
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,711
Why he's been working so late?

192
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,515
Couldn't the reason be another woman?

193
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,415
It's difficult for us to let go...

194
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:56,793
of what we desire deep within ourselves.

195
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,221
Hello, Tronte.

196
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:04,791
Hello.

197
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,089
What's that?

198
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:24,811
It's so beautiful.

199
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,000
Why weren't you at school today?

200
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,026
What are you doing here?

201
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,075
I like it here.

202
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,490
It's so...

203
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,406
desolate.

204
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,656
I like to write, you know.

205
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:03,058
Stories.

206
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,450
You have a nice smile.

207
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:21,981
POLICE

208
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,901
What are you doing here?

209
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,260
You can't just show up here.

210
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,208
What if someone sees you?

211
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:54,876
Is everything okay?

212
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,031
I'm pregnant.

213
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:31,741
I thought you were being careful.

214
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,411
Is it mine?

215
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:57,096
Is it yours?

216
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:02,738
What do you think I do
all day long? Fuck around?

217
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:05,498
Do you think I chose this?

218
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,520
Living in this shithole?

219
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:11,956
I thought you were harmless,
but you're all the same.

220
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:15,123
You all think you own the world.
That you can take what you want.

221
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:17,765
You eat and fuck and think you're God.

222
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:21,498
Everywhere you go, always the
same fucking smug arseholes.

223
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,130
Katharina, you don't
know what you're saying.

224
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:37,178
It's best if I drive you home now.

225
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:53,515
The coal industry has him
wrapped around its little finger.

226
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:56,748
I don't care how long it takes!

227
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,270
We'll submit another
building permit request.

228
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:05,706
Nuclear power is the future.
And the future cannot be stopped.

229
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:09,133
I don't care what the mayor says!

230
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:16,245
Oh, Claudia.

231
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:22,173
Look at you.

232
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,431
You're all grown up.

233
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:27,788
A real lady.

234
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,456
Pretty and smart as a whip.

235
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:34,718
Helge will be pleased to see you.

236
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,020
And, of course, you'll be
rewarded for your services.

237
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:47,413
But that's far too much.

238
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:53,503
Let me give you some
advice. A life lesson.

239
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:56,706
If you really want something,

240
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:58,258
then take it.

241
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,060
Things don't just happen by themselves.

242
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,200
Thank you.

243
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:17,748
NUCLEAR POWER AND PEACE

244
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:24,708
TOWN HALL

245
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:46,598
Is Heinz sick, or...

246
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,473
What do you want?

247
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:17,206
How much money did the
coal industry pay you

248
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:19,808
to block the plans for
the nuclear power plant?

249
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:25,233
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

250
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:28,516
So Doppler sent you, right?

251
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:33,331
Do you know what money can't buy?

252
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:35,736
The future.

253
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:39,458
More precisely, your future.

254
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:44,748
We think we're immortal,

255
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,920
but, in truth, often only one breath...

256
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:52,083
separates the now from the hereafter.

257
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:58,216
What do you want from me?

258
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:09,878
WINDEN BUILDING AUTHORITY

259
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,664
BUILDING PERMIT

260
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:16,466
The building permit for the
nuclear power plant, it's...

261
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:25,311
To the future.

262
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,664
You can change it.

263
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:32,414
Both of you can change it.

264
00:29:32,416 --> 00:29:36,289
The barrels at the nuclear plant,
they trigger the apocalypse.

265
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:38,911
You have to stop them
from being opened.

266
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,505
What do we do then?

267
00:29:43,291 --> 00:29:46,164
Eva said there's a
way to undo this knot.

268
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:48,826
That there's a way Martha
can live. My Martha!

269
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,530
She lied to you.

270
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:58,925
There is no way to save both worlds.

271
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:03,196
You have to choose one of them.

272
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:07,325
The apocalypse, in 2 days...

273
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:10,451
it can be stopped.

274
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:13,951
You two can stop it.

275
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:17,456
They can live. All of them.

276
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:18,658
Mikkel...

277
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,508
can live.

278
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,520
Isn't that what you wanted?

279
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:27,275
But, in return,
you have to let her go.

280
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:29,521
Your Martha.

281
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:31,533
Your world.

282
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,200
You've seen what becomes of you there.

283
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:37,431
What you'll do.

284
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,410
What Adam will do.

285
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,914
You're both out of your minds.

286
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:48,789
I'm going home now, and
I'll wake up in my bed

287
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:51,481
and all this will have been
just a crappy dream.

288
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,831
Jonas, this is exactly what you wanted.

289
00:30:57,833 --> 00:30:59,498
You and Martha.

290
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,630
In this world, the two
of you are not impossible.

291
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:14,458
Martha!

292
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:20,833
Wait!

293
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,039
Hey.

294
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:27,041
Hey.

295
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:41,275
You believe all this?

296
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:44,465
That they're all going to die?

297
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,950
That's crazy.

298
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,940
I'm crazy. This is...

299
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:23,278
Believe me, I know exactly how it feels.

300
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,260
It's all true?

301
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:36,243
Everything she said is true?

302
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:45,811
But I know there's a way.

303
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,030
A way to straighten all this out again.

304
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:53,248
And I'm not going to
stop looking for that way.

305
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,570
I think that's what she's doing too.

306
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:01,476
The Martha who brought me here.

307
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:26,263
It's time.

308
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,910
So you have no idea where your mum is?

309
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,830
And the man this morning...

310
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:27,498
You think that may have been your dad?

311
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,910
My mother didn't talk about him much.

312
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,220
She said...

313
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,690
he's a bad person.

314
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,526
I was in a home for a long time.

315
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:41,393
What's it like in a home?

316
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:56,165
Can you keep a secret?

317
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,939
That man this morning...

318
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:03,591
I don't even want to
know if he's my dad.

319
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:06,513
And I'm glad that my mother's gone.

320
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:10,488
You can have it if you want.

321
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:22,948
Jana?

322
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:25,526
What are you doing here?

323
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,680
Didn't you go home hours ago?

324
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:39,266
We're already late. I'm sure
Mum is waiting with dinner.

325
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,706
See you around.

326
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:47,628
Maybe see you tomorrow.

327
00:36:04,416 --> 00:36:06,076
What do we do now?

328
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:20,995
Don't worry. I don't want to keep it.

329
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,789
Why do some people have everything?

330
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:32,431
And others nothing?

331
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:34,766
Hm?

332
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:39,776
Why does destiny preordain all that's
good for some and not for others?

333
00:36:56,875 --> 00:37:00,475
All my life I've been trying to
hold onto things you can't hold onto.

334
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,820
But now I finally understand.

335
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:09,475
I don't need anyone.

336
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:14,178
None of you.

337
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,120
It's best you go now.

338
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,438
Last year...

339
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:53,966
Daniel told me about it.

340
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:57,348
She does it properly.

341
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:04,213
MRS. OBENDORF

342
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:14,083
I'm sorry.

343
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,846
You sent them off?

344
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,300
The beginning is the end.

345
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:55,133
And the end is the beginning.

346
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:58,125
We are all born of him.

347
00:39:59,916 --> 00:40:01,666
You gave him life.

348
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:05,215
And he will give us ours.

349
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:08,533
Him.

350
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:10,581
Agnes.

351
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:11,883
Tronte.

352
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:13,814
Jana.

353
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:15,216
Ulrich.

354
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,720
Katharina.

355
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:21,408
You.

356
00:40:24,708 --> 00:40:27,268
A line without a beginning or an end.

357
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:31,881
An infinite circle.

358
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,740
Doris?

359
00:40:57,541 --> 00:40:59,211
Is everything okay?

360
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:42,081
I...

361
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,843
I wanted to apologise.

362
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:47,471
For this morning.

363
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:52,888
I know you just wanted to help.

364
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:00,826
Lately, I...

365
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:07,411
I haven't really been myself.

366
00:42:08,833 --> 00:42:10,323
Work and...

367
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:15,783
I'm sorry.

368
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:23,065
I know what you've been up to.

369
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,930
With that woman.

370
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:31,091
What do you mean?

371
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:35,878
I want a divorce.

372
00:42:38,916 --> 00:42:40,936
What are you talking about?

373
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:49,710
We should have done it sooner,
but I... I thought...

374
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:54,085
I don't know what I thought.

375
00:42:55,666 --> 00:42:57,546
All these secrets.

376
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:01,311
I don't want to live like this.

377
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:04,033
I...

378
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,375
I can explain it to you.

379
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,100
The ways of the heart
cannot be explained.

380
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:16,698
It does what it wants.

381
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:42,041
Hello.

382
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:46,538
I... I'm here to see Mrs. Obendorf.

383
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:07,376
You have to wait.

384
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,590
My mother says...

385
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:33,005
they go to hell.

386
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:36,491
The...

387
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:39,314
the ones that are gotten rid of.

388
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:41,226
I don't believe in hell.

389
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:46,361
Hell is what we make
for ourselves on Earth.

390
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,130
I'm Helene.

391
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,830
Helene Albers.

392
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,865
Katharina.

393
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:17,243
That's a very beautiful name.

394
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,960
St. Christopher!

395
00:45:29,375 --> 00:45:31,095
A nice thought.

396
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:35,143
Someone carrying us on our journey.

397
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:39,830
Someone watching over us.

398
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,150
Come on now.

399
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:01,533
Hello, Dad.

400
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:12,316
Where's Mum?

401
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:22,683
The ways of the heart
cannot be explained.

402
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:30,895
It does what it wants.

403
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:44,158
Come on.

404
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:46,533
Leave him.

405
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:04,575
WINDEN BUILDING AUTHORITY

406
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:10,731
BUILDING PERMIT

407
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:57,538
You promised me something.

408
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:03,908
I kept my end of the agreement.

409
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:07,363
Now you have to keep yours.

410
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:18,789
You want to know where the origin is.

411
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:20,661
And how to destroy it.

412
00:49:26,416 --> 00:49:27,616
You will.

413
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:35,043
It took me over 66 years

414
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:39,428
to finally understand how
everything is connected.

415
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:52,168
You're right.

416
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:55,578
It's time you understood, too.

417
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:42,566
At school...

418
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:48,780
when you came through the door, I...

419
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:51,425
I had this feeling.

420
00:50:55,125 --> 00:50:56,825
As if we knew each other.

421
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:05,823
From a dream.

422
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,200
Or...

423
00:51:09,541 --> 00:51:10,791
I'm sorry.

424
00:51:12,291 --> 00:51:13,691
About it all.

425
00:51:28,541 --> 00:51:30,161
Where you're from...

426
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,610
what was I like there?

427
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:41,633
Was I different?

428
00:53:17,791 --> 00:53:22,601
I AM LEFT TO DIE ALONE,
AND I AM MY SOLE JUDGE. ME.

429
00:53:32,166 --> 00:53:37,576
THE BEGINNING IS THE END.
AND THE END IS THE BEGINNING.

430
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:29,591
Why are we here?

431
00:57:32,791 --> 00:57:34,414
Because this...

432
00:57:34,416 --> 00:57:36,876
is where everything began.

433
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:40,408
In your world.

434
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:42,733
What does that mean?

435
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:55,789
Your older self.

436
00:57:55,791 --> 00:57:58,831
She sent you and Jonas back

437
00:57:58,833 --> 00:58:00,673
for a single purpose.

438
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:16,098
You were never meant
to stop the apocalypse.

439
00:58:18,208 --> 00:58:21,418
You were to create the origin.

440
00:58:37,083 --> 00:58:39,333
This is the origin.

441
00:58:42,625 --> 00:58:44,706
What's growing inside you

442
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:46,789
is the bridge between both worlds.

443
00:58:46,791 --> 00:58:48,191
It can't be.

444
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:52,456
It is the beginning of the knot

445
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:54,628
and it will be its end.

446
00:58:58,958 --> 00:59:00,208
Your son.

447
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:04,603
He is the origin.
