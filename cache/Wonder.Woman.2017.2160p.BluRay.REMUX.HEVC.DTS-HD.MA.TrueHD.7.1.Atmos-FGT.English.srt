Long ago, when time was new

and all of history was still a dream,

69
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,469
<i>the Gods ruled the Earth,</i>

70
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,306
<i>Zeus king among them.</i>

71
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,020
<i>Zeus created beings
over which the Gods would rule.</i>

72

<i>fair and good,
strong and passionate.</i>

74
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,740
He called his creation "man."
And mankind was good.

75
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,911
But Zeus's son
grew envious of mankind

76
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,331
and sought to corrupt
his father's creation.

77
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:58,835
<i>This was Ares, the God of War.</i>

78
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:05,216
Ares poisoned men's hearts
with jealousy and suspicion.

79
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,510
<i>He turned them against one another</i>

80
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,680
<i>and war ravaged the Earth.</i>

81
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:15,727
<i>So, the Gods created us, the Amazons,</i>

82
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,521
<i>to influence men's hearts with love</i>

83

<i>and restore peace to the Earth.</i>

84
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,364
<i>And for a brief time, there was peace.</i>

ANTIOPE: <i>But it did not last.</i>

86
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,090
<i>Your mother, the Amazon Queen,
led a revolt</i>

87
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,218
<i>that freed us all from enslavement.</i>

88
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,478
<i>When Zeus led the Gods to our defense,</i>

89
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,898
<i>Ares killed them one by one,</i>

90
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,235
<i>until only Zeus himself remained.</i>

to stop Ares,</i>

92
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:16,579
<i>striking such a blow,
the God of War was forced to retreat.</i>

93
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:18,915
<i>But Zeus knew</i>

94
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:23,253
<i>that one day, Ares might return
to finish his mission.</i>

95
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,297
<i>An endless war,</i>

96
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,467
<i>where mankind would finally
destroy themselves,</i>

97
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,429
<i>and us with them.</i>

98
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,015
ANTIOPE: <i>So Zeus left us a weapon,</i>

99
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,268
<i>one powerful enough to kill a God.</i>

100
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:43,440
HIPPOLYTA: <i>With his dying breath,
Zeus created this island</i>

101
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,859
<i>to hide us from the outside world,</i>

102
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,361
<i>somewhere Ares could not find us.</i>

103
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,118
<i>And all has been quiet ever since.</i>

104
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:07,005
We give thanks to the Gods
for giving us this paradise.

The Godkiller?

107
