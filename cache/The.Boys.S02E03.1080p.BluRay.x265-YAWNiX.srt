All right, look.

So, um...

12
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:14,659
sorry?

00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,247

- Easy, easy, easy, kid.
- I'll fucking kill you!

17
00:01:35,597 --> 00:01:37,349
- Relax.
- Fucking hell. Kid's stark raving.

18
00:01:37,432 --> 00:01:39,184
No, no, no.

19
00:01:39,768 --> 00:01:40,936
Breathe. Breathe.

20
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,520

21
00:01:43,397 --> 00:01:44,690
- Fucking hell.
- Kid, breathe.

22
00:01:44,773 --> 00:01:46,066
- Just breathe.
- Okay.

23
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:47,150
- Okay?
- Okay.

24
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:48,277

I can't just push a button anymore.

00:01:58,954 --> 00:02:01,081
The target's secure? No one's seen him?

31
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:04,001
We're three fucking miles offshore, Grace.
What do you think?

32
00:02:04,084 --> 00:02:06,461
I think if there's a way to screw this up
you'll find it.

33
00:02:07,713 --> 00:02:12,301
Look, I just want me wife back.

<i>The fuck's that gotta do with anything?</i>

38
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:25,147
I'm not sure yet.

39
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:27,566
How's your crew holding up?

40
00:02:28,317 --> 00:02:29,318
Yeah, all good.

41
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:31,653
We are having a few laughs here,
I'll tell you that.

42
00:02:31,737 --> 00:02:34,156
The target is the girl's brother?

43
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,239
<i>Yeah, so?</i>

44
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:38,118
You don't think
it compromises her allegiances?

45
00:02:40,037 --> 00:02:41,037
Well...

46
00:02:42,164 --> 00:02:43,498
if it comes to that...

47
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,251
I'll neutralise her.

48
00:02:46,335 --> 00:02:48,879
<i>The compassion you show your team
is truly touching.</i>

49
00:02:56,636 --> 00:02:58,347
It's just a figure of speech, mate.

50
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:15,590
You remember in the camp...

51
00:04:15,674 --> 00:04:20,220
you were so hungry
you'd cry all the time

52
00:04:21,138 --> 00:04:24,766
and I snuck into the storage room
to steal you rice?

53
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,981
I took care of you.

54
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:37,404
I still will.

55
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:46,663
I also remember the time
they came after you for stealing.

56
00:04:47,747 --> 00:04:51,376
I said no, it was me,
and they broke my hands.

57
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:54,713
You might be my big sister.

58
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:58,425
But I protect you too.
We protect each other.

59
00:05:00,802 --> 00:05:01,887
You know...

60
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:04,806
the Americans will torture me.

61
00:05:05,724 --> 00:05:07,517
I won't let them.

62
00:05:09,728 --> 00:05:11,104
How will you stop them?

63
00:05:15,025 --> 00:05:17,652
You have to let me go.

64
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:22,574
I won't attack anyone.

65
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:24,659
I won't hurt anyone.

66
00:05:27,871 --> 00:05:30,081
I'm your brother...

67
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,836
we only have each other now.

68
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,714
Please.

69
00:05:51,645 --> 00:05:54,856
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:27,430
Thank you.

71
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,942
- I gotta go, man. I'm out.
- All right.

72
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:41,611
- Yo, yo.
- Later, man.

73
00:07:04,301 --> 00:07:06,678
- Breakfast is served.
- Mm.

74
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:08,096
Want one or two, buddy?

75
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:09,848
- Just one.
- Yeah, just one.

76
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,476
- You want maple syrup?
- Um...

77
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,811
Yes, please.

78
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,442
Little more.

79
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:24,654
Mm. Thank you. Love it.

80
00:07:40,587 --> 00:07:41,671
This is nice.

81
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:47,636

Hey, Ryan.

86
00:08:01,775 --> 00:08:03,860
You wanna stay in here and learn Spanish,

87
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:06,988
or do you wanna come outside
and have some fun with your old man, huh?

88
00:08:08,198 --> 00:08:10,825
- I think that he needs to...
- Is it okay if I go?

89
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:12,577
Yeah, of course it's okay. Right, Mom?

90
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,829
- Come on.
- Sure.

91
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,125
There you go, champ.

92
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:26,216
You guys fucking ready?

93
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:27,592
Okay, we pan up.

94
00:08:27,676 --> 00:08:30,762
We see Homelander
flying towards Martinez's Miami mansion.

95
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:32,430
And Martinez makes a run for it.

96
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:39,396
Octavio accelerates,
but Homelander laser-blasts out the tyres.

97
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,147
Bzzt! Unh!

98
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:44,359
Martinez gets out of the car,

99
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:45,610
dazed.

100
00:08:45,694 --> 00:08:46,694
Looks up.

101
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:50,240
Homelander: "You're under arrest."

102
00:08:50,323 --> 00:08:54,661
And he slaps the handcuffs
on Martinez. The cops take him away.

103
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:58,957
Homelander turns to the other heroes:
"We should work together more often."

104
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,959
"You mean like a team-up?"

105
00:09:02,335 --> 00:09:03,545
"Exactly.

106
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:05,880
All seven of us."

107
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:08,966
Holy shit.

108
00:09:11,428 --> 00:09:12,428
Holy shit.

109
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:17,100
That is the moment The Seven became...

110
00:09:18,852 --> 00:09:19,852

111
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:21,730

00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:35,243

00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:37,120
Wow, I am very impressed.

Thank you so much.

118
00:09:38,455 --> 00:09:40,832
And, gang, that's just the teaser.

119
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:43,460
Look, this is not just a superhero...

120
00:09:43,543 --> 00:09:44,669
You look like shit.

121
00:09:44,753 --> 00:09:46,671
- Yes!
- Had a big night.

122
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:50,759
And I wanna shoot
the whole thing handheld.

123
00:09:50,842 --> 00:09:52,177
Very Greengrass, very grounded.

124
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,344
I wanna take the audience

125
00:09:53,428 --> 00:09:55,764
and literally put them,
boom, right there in the action.

126
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:58,266
- What's the plan on Translucent?
- That's a great question.

127
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:01,269
We're gonna take a stuntman,
put him in a jumpsuit, and CG him out.

128
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:03,897
And... fuck, I don't wanna jinx this,

129
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,316
but Lin-Manuel Miranda
wants to do the voice.

130
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,400
I love <i>Hamilton!</i>

131
00:10:07,484 --> 00:10:08,860

132
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:10,445
- Think...?
- Excuse me.

133
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:12,781
- I'm sorry to interrupt this lovefest.
- No.

134
00:10:12,864 --> 00:10:14,657
- I just wanna be a part of it.
- Understood.

135
00:10:14,741 --> 00:10:16,117
This... Ugh!

136
00:10:16,326 --> 00:10:17,660
- Great work.
- Thank you so much.

137
00:10:17,744 --> 00:10:20,455
This script is a great start.

138
00:10:20,538 --> 00:10:21,915
Really good bones.

139
00:10:22,457 --> 00:10:24,584
I just have a few headlines.

140
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:27,879
Totally. Listen, we can tweak dialogue
right up to the day of production.

141
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:31,174
Yeah, it's not really tweaks.
It's more... global.

142
00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:35,053
Okay, yeah. What are we, um...?

143
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:37,180
What are we thinking?

144
00:10:37,472 --> 00:10:38,472
Oh, um...

145
00:10:38,515 --> 00:10:39,515
Like...

146
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:42,936
you write all women
as either unknowable Hitchcock bitches

147
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:44,145
or Michael Bay fuck dolls.

148
00:10:44,229 --> 00:10:46,815
I mean, I get that a lifetime
of jerking off to <i>Transformers</i>

149
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:48,900
didn't exactly make you popular
with the ladies,

150
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:51,861
but a little effort would be nice,
you know what I'm saying?

151
00:10:51,945 --> 00:10:54,739
Um, excuse me, but I do have two sisters,

152
00:10:54,823 --> 00:10:55,865
thank you very much.

153
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:58,034
- Of course you do.
- And excuse me,

154
00:10:58,117 --> 00:11:00,161
but Homelander really loves the script.

155
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:01,161
- Yes.
- So...

156
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:02,790
Oh, okay. Where is he?

157
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:09,169
Ashley?

158
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:13,049
Um, okay.

159
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:14,132
Fuck.

160
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:16,929
Okay. Just, you know,
continue doing what you're doing.

161
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:19,472
I just have to get to my...
I have to... I have a...

00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:28,815
Can someone open this, please?

165
00:11:31,985 --> 00:11:33,778
- Okay.
- Okay.

166
00:11:33,862 --> 00:11:35,488
I got a few more headlines.

167
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:39,617
Mr Edgar.

168
00:11:40,285 --> 00:11:42,161
Sir, if this is all true,

169
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:44,998
I will get a strategy together
with Crisis Management and PR.

170
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:46,249
We're fine for now, Ashley.

171
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:47,375
Sir, is it true?

172
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,252
- We're investigating.
- What they're saying?

173
00:11:50,003 --> 00:11:51,462
Sir, I have to tell you something.

174
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:54,507
We have to tell Homelander,
and I have to admit something to you. I...

175
00:11:54,591 --> 00:11:57,719
You don't have the faintest idea
where Homelander is.

176
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:01,264
He will know when I want him to know.

177
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:05,184

00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:39,260
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, come on.

187
00:12:39,344 --> 00:12:41,554
I saw you with the V in your hand.

188
00:12:41,638 --> 00:12:43,598
Yeah, and you let me walk away with it.

189
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:46,851
So... this is kind of on you too.

190

If I go down, you come with me.

191

You don't get it.

193
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,657
You don't fuck with the money.

194
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:04,827
You never fuck with the money.

195
00:13:04,911 --> 00:13:06,371
We're gonna lose everything.

196
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:10,458
I mean, cars, houses, bonuses.

197
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,252
There are more important things.

198

You know, the only people that say that...

199

We passed the pet store...

210
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:55,461
They were begging.

216

00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:07,064
Hey. Ryan, I need you to wake up.

Are you hurt?

307
00:19:19,328 --> 00:19:21,704
- Does anything feel broken? Let me see.
- For God's sake.

308
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:23,581
Come on, look at him.
Not a scratch on him.

309
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:26,500
You know why? 'Cause he's my son.

310
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:29,754
And you...
You're raising him to be a pussy.

311
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:31,714
You don't get to tell me
how to raise my son.

312

I'm his father.

You don't get to say that
after what you did.

314
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:36,552
What I did to you

315

that you are raising like a little girl.

316

He's mine.

318

Get your hands off of her!

319

I fucking hate you! Leave us alone!

323
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,796
Hey, it's okay. I'm not angry.

324
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,338
Ryan.

325
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:14,673
Go away!

326
00:20:14,757 --> 00:20:16,550
- Buddy, it's okay...
- Leave us alone!

327
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:19,053
Ryan, this is a good thing.

328
00:20:43,244 --> 00:20:46,705
These are horrible powdered cheese things,

329
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:48,958
but if you're hungry...

330
00:20:53,796 --> 00:20:54,796
Fuck you.

331
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,174
So you do speak English.

332
00:21:01,846 --> 00:21:02,846
Thirsty?

333
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:14,525
You know,
the way you talk with your sister

334
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:17,903
is no sign language I ever seen.

335
00:21:22,116 --> 00:21:23,534
I just wanna help her.

336
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:29,999
I can help her.

337
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:34,545
You understand?

338
00:21:41,427 --> 00:21:43,262
The night our parents were murdered,

339
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:47,433
Kimiko just stopped talking.

340
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:49,684
Can't talk.

341
00:21:50,436 --> 00:21:52,271
She's never made a sound since.

342
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:54,522
In the camp,

343
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:58,944
we were alone week after week,

344
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:01,780
just the two of us, for years.

345
00:22:06,494 --> 00:22:09,622
We came up with a language

346
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:12,333
so we could get through it.

347
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:16,879
It saved us.

348
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:19,839
Both of us.

349
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:26,472
Will you teach me?

350
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:39,901
Please.

351
00:22:43,489 --> 00:22:44,489
Fuck you.

352
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:56,627
I think your sister is very special.

353
00:22:59,255 --> 00:23:01,507
And she loves you very much.

354
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:58,731
<i>I don't know anything
about this Compound V monkey business.</i>

355
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:02,192
<i>If someone gave it to my little Maeve,
I sure as hell didn't know.</i>

356
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:04,194
Bullshit, he didn't know.

357
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:07,948
I remember this one weekend
where he made me do three mall appearances

358
00:24:08,032 --> 00:24:11,285
and a photo shoot for <i>Teen Vogue,</i>
all to get the cash for my braces,

359
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:15,581
which he then blew
at the five-dollar table at Circus Circus.

360
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:17,458
Maybe this is what we've been waiting for.

361
00:24:18,459 --> 00:24:19,460
What do you mean?

362
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:22,046
<i>They've lied to you,
from the beginning, all of them.</i>

363
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:23,964
You don't owe them anything.

364
00:24:24,465 --> 00:24:26,550
Maybe this is our chance
to leave while we can.

365
00:24:26,634 --> 00:24:30,429
Elena, if we do that,
you know what'll happen.

366
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:34,099
I'll call you back.

367
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:39,730
I'm not, uh, interrupting, am I?

368
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:40,898
No, of course not.

369
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,440
Great.

370
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,787
It's funny, you know, uh...

371
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:01,210
of all the people here,

372
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:05,005
I've known you the longest.

373
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:06,923
Yeah.

374
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:11,845
Sometimes...

375
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:15,974
it just seems
like you're the only person I can lean on.

376
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,478
Yeah, I... I feel the same way.

377
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:25,441
You do?

378
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,277
Of course.

379
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,790
You...

380
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:44,545
Oh, fuck.

381
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:45,713
Life, huh?

382
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:50,092
It's crazy.

383
00:25:54,513 --> 00:25:55,513
Who's Elena?

384
00:25:55,931 --> 00:25:57,683
Elena's an old friend.

385
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,647
Since when do you have friends?

386
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:08,610
I was just venting
about all this fucking bullshit.

387
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:10,571
What bullshit?

388
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:12,489
Wait, you haven't heard?

389
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,950
Where have you been?

390
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,836
What the fuck?

391
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:27,713
This is the NYPD.

392
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:30,716
This boat's been reported stolen.
You're all under arrest.

393
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,635
I repeat, this is the NYPD.
This boat's been reported stolen.

394
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:35,929
I thought you said
this boat belongs to a friend.

395
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:40,768
Well, a stranger is just a friend
you ain't met yet.

396
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:44,521
- Don't fuck this up.
- I ain't gonna fuck it up.

397
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:47,191
Vought's almost toast.
We're almost home free.

398
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:49,318
I said,
I ain't gonna fuck it up, all right?

399
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,153
Ahoy, gents.

400
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:53,781
I am the captain of <i>My Big Wet Dream.</i>

401
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:59,703
I'm holding papers signed by the owner
for the lease of this vessel.

402
00:26:59,787 --> 00:27:02,247
So there must be
some kind of misunderstanding.

403
00:27:02,748 --> 00:27:03,832
Look out!

404
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:07,293
Get his hands!

405
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:18,388
Mayday!

406
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,559
Time to go.

407
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:29,274
- What are you doing? We gotta help them.
- They're already dead.

408
00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:31,443
You don't know that.
They... We have to try.

409
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:33,654
Literally everyone
is on their way here right now.

410
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:35,531
We stay here, we die too.

411
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:42,787
Fuck.

412
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:54,298
What?

413
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,468
I wasn't the one who fucked that up.

414
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:15,696
I know how you feel. I'm a freak too.

415
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:18,156
Oh, you shoot a fucking bow and arrow.

416
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,324
I'm amphibious.

417
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:22,369
Okay, just give me the phone.

418
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:23,745
Cancel the call.

419
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:26,623
Postmating Papa John's isn't gonna help.

420
00:28:26,707 --> 00:28:29,626
How do you know what helps?
You don't know anything about me.

421
00:28:31,086 --> 00:28:33,630
Let's just recite the 15 Tenets together.

422
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:36,925
No. Fuck you and your creepy shit, Eagle.
I'm hungry.

423
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:41,430
Deep. It's time.

424
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:42,598
Time for what?

425
00:28:42,681 --> 00:28:45,684
For you.
It's your time to get back into The Seven.

426
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:48,770
- What?
- This came from Alastair himself.

427
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:51,732
Holy shit.

428
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:53,233
Who?

429
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:56,194
Alastair Adana. The leader of the Church.

430
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:58,155
He sits in the first chair.

431
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:00,197
Cool.

432
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:05,662
Guys, with everything going on, I just...
I don't think I can do it right now.

433
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:08,540
No, Deep. This is your journey.

434
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:10,000
You're ready.

435
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,960
You have been ready all along.

436
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:14,922
Now get out there and be a hero.

437
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:23,639
<i>My dad always used to say,
"Where there's smoke, there's fire."</i>

438
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:28,393
<i>Vought lied to us about Compound V.
What else are they lying to us about?</i>

439
00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:32,314
We're down 68 percent in morning trading,
20 percent in the last 15 minutes.

440
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:34,066
- It hits 19, start a buyback.
- Yes, sir.

441
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:35,901
Jesus. What about the pharmaceuticals?

442
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:37,736
Pfizer's dismayed at our lack of ethics.

443
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:40,322
Investor lawsuits,
breach of fiduciary duty, nondisclosure.

444
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:43,158
Exposure for fraud,
assault, infliction of bodily harm.

445
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:45,994
- All policy exclusions, no coverage.
- We have two options.

446
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:49,623
Option one, deny. High risk, high reward.

447
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:51,875
But if we deny and they nail us,

448
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:54,419
if there's a legit whistleblower,
there's no coming back.

449
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:57,547
That's bankruptcy, criminal charges,
ten to 15 for everyone in this room.

450
00:29:57,631 --> 00:29:59,466
Option two, mea culpa.

451
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,259
They've called it.

452
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:02,386
Trading's halted.

453
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:07,014
Stan.

454
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:12,145
We gotta put out a statement.
Which one is it?

455
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:15,648
Stan.

456
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:20,028
A power-drink can, Frenchie?

457
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:23,448
- You're a goddamn idiot.
- I was trying to help her.

458
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,743
Where the hell are your mates?

459
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:30,038
- New deal. You gotta bring him in.
<i>- Grace, we're three miles offshore.</i>

460
00:30:30,122 --> 00:30:34,167
You just crashed a police helicopter.
Not exactly keeping a low profile.

461
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:37,796
All right. Where do you want us to go?

462
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:40,590
CIA safe house, Hazlet. Be there in 30.

463
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:43,719
<i>- And, Butcher?</i>
- Yeah?

464
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:45,846
Please be careful.

465
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:48,347
I will.

466
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:52,978
Fuck me.

467
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:59,109
<i>Please leave your name
and number and a message after the beep.</i>

468
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:02,487
Hey. Hey, Annie, it's me again.

469
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:07,492
I was just wondering,
have you ever seen the music video

470
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:10,328
for that Billy Joel song
"You're Only Human"?

471
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:13,623
There's this kid,
and he's climbing up a bridge,

472
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:15,500
and he's gonna kill himself.

473
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:18,587
But then Billy Joel steps out
with his harmonica and tells him to stop.

474
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,547
"You just have to wait
for your second wind."

475
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:23,884
And now I feel like I'm that kid...

476
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:27,637
and I'm gonna drown and...

477
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:36,646
And thank God
I found my second wind, because it's you.

478
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:39,399
You're my second wind.

479
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,612
Um...

480
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,199
Look, I know it's exciting
taking down Vought

481
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:50,410
and being like James Bond and everything,

482
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:54,790
but you gotta be careful because
that stuff can go to shit really quick...

483
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:00,337
and you wind up
hurting the people that you love.

484
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:03,799
Like the way that I hurt you.

485
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:05,675
Um...

486
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:11,181
Anyhoo, that's all I wanted to say.

487
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:14,351
Second wind.

488
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:15,519
Fuck.

489
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:18,730
Okay, thanks. Bye.

490
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:45,048
I know I don't come up to 99 enough,

491
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:47,509
and I apologise for that.

492
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:53,598
But times like this tend
to give us clarity, don't they?

493
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:59,146
You and me are partners, after all.

494
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:02,399
A symbiotic part of a larger thing,

495
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:06,319
a living thing named Vought.

496
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:11,074
And that's how we'll get through this.
Together as Vought.

497
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:12,784
But, sir...

498
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:16,997
I gotta say...

499
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:24,754
we didn't know about this Compound V shit.

500
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:26,131
None of us.

501
00:33:26,214 --> 00:33:27,424
Is that so?

502
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:31,469
Well, we're all victims here, A-Train,
but we'll get to the bottom of it.

503
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:32,469
I promise.

504
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,598
Right now,
catching this super-terrorist is the...

505
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:35,724
Villain.

506
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:39,394
Super-villain.

507
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:42,022
Sure, whatever.

508
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:46,651
It must be our priority,
and it changes the conversation.

509
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:50,280
So you want us to go out there? Now?

510
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:55,452
I mean, we still need to be prepped
by Legal and PR.

511
00:33:55,994 --> 00:33:58,038
- We'll be eaten alive.
- There's no time for that.

512
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:03,627
Well, I'm sorry, but I don't think
we have to damage-control your fuckup.

513
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:05,337
Hey, guys.

514
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:07,589
Enough.

515
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:11,551
We gotta pull together here.

516
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:14,429
- Thank you, Homelander.
- Shh. Not you.

517
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:16,597
Us.

518
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:18,724
The Seven.

519
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:25,148
See, it doesn't matter
who made us or how we got here.

520
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:26,274
The point is...

521
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:29,110
we are here.

522
00:34:30,237 --> 00:34:31,237
Together.

523
00:34:32,697 --> 00:34:33,823
Family.

524
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:36,952
You guys...

525
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:41,039
you are my real family.

526
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:47,963
This guy? He doesn't care about us.

527
00:34:48,046 --> 00:34:50,507
We're not his partners. We're his product.

528
00:34:51,508 --> 00:34:54,010
So who gives a shit
if Vought burns to the fucking ground?

529
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:55,010
You should think

530
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:57,765
- before you say something you don't mean.
- Really? Should I?

531
00:34:57,847 --> 00:35:00,225
We are not Vought.

532
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:04,980
You see, companies,
they come and go, but talent...

533
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,316
talent is forever.

534
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:13,113
The world still needs superheroes.

535
00:35:13,196 --> 00:35:17,117
And that, family, that's what we are.

536
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,953
So let's get out there
and do what it is we do.

537
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:23,540
Let's take this cocksucker down.

538
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:30,046
Fuck Vought, huh?

539
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,215
I did not see that coming from you.

540
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:34,676
Maybe you don't know me that well.

541
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:36,261
Maybe I don't.

542
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,853
- How far?
- A mile. Right there.

543
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:56,281
- What the fuck was that?
- What the hell was that?

544
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:04,455
Take the wheel.

545
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:23,433
We lost power.

546
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:37,697
Everyone, off the boat. Now.

547
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,492
Frenchie, grab the winch.

548
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:47,540
Come on. Let's go, let's go. Get in.

549
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:50,293
- Come on, come on. Let's go, let's go.
- Fuck.

550
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:53,588
Come on.
Frenchie, start it up. Go, go, go.

551
00:36:53,671 --> 00:36:54,756
Go, go, go.

552
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,892
Look, there! Head for the storm drain!

553
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,993
Oh, shit.

554
00:37:36,214 --> 00:37:38,716
- Butcher! What are you doing?
- Butcher!

555
00:37:41,094 --> 00:37:43,012
Butcher!

556
00:38:16,087 --> 00:38:18,047
Fucking diabolical.

557
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:26,473
Where's Hughie?

558
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:29,141
Hughie!

559
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,020
Oh, jeez.

560
00:38:35,064 --> 00:38:36,064
You all right?

561
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:39,694
Come on, son. We've gotta leg it.

562
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:41,905
Deep's here,
and The Seven won't be far behind.

563
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:46,159
Um, you know what? Okay, you guys
go ahead. You guys go ahead. I'm good.

564
00:38:46,701 --> 00:38:47,785
Eh? What?

565
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:51,539
I'm just gonna sit here and wait,
if you don't mind.

566
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:53,124
What the fuck are you waiting for?

567
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,711
My second wind.

568
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:02,342
All right, listen. Come on.

569
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:06,054
- Come on.
- Get your fucking hands off of me!

570
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:09,098
Jeez.

571
00:39:09,807 --> 00:39:11,935
All right, fine. Suit yourself.

572
00:39:14,938 --> 00:39:16,940
All right. Come on, let's go.

573
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:24,197
We can't leave the kid, man.

574
00:39:25,156 --> 00:39:28,201
Pinocchio's staying put. Have at it.

575
00:39:39,504 --> 00:39:40,504
Hey, kid.

576
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:43,258
What are you doing here?

577
00:39:51,307 --> 00:39:52,600
You ain't going...

578
00:39:53,935 --> 00:39:54,935
I ain't going.

579
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:58,439
They're gonna be here any second.

580
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:00,816
Probably.

581
00:40:10,743 --> 00:40:13,246
- Asshole.
- Yep.

582
00:40:29,971 --> 00:40:30,971
This way.

583
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:33,724
Frenchie.

584
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:38,061
Hey, Butcher.

585
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:40,314
Petit Hughie.

586
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:44,569
Hey, the kid's falling apart.
You know that, right?

587
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:46,738
Well, what do you expect?
He's a fucking civilian.

588
00:40:46,821 --> 00:40:49,699
No, no, no.
It's not just him. It's all of us.

589
00:40:49,782 --> 00:40:52,994
Move the feet.
Just move the feet. Come on.

590
00:40:54,412 --> 00:40:55,412
Move.

591
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:58,875
We're at our breaking point,
at each other's throats,

592
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:00,752
and you keep pushing us and pushing.

593
00:41:00,835 --> 00:41:03,630
- It's like...
- Yeah. Right over the fucking finish line.

594
00:41:03,713 --> 00:41:09,052
We just need to keep our shit together
a little bit longer. Okay?

595
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:13,765
We hand that cunt over,
and I get Becca and you get your girls.

596
00:41:13,848 --> 00:41:16,059
- We're right fucking there.
- Butcher, Butcher.

597
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:18,561
Hughie's not gonna make it,

598
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:21,064
and you need that kid,

599
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:23,107
more than any one of us.

600
00:41:24,192 --> 00:41:25,485
He's your canary.

601
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:27,862
My canary?

602
00:41:28,446 --> 00:41:30,365
You let your canary die,

603
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:33,201
how you gonna know
when you've gone too far?

604
00:41:33,284 --> 00:41:37,872
Oh, fuck me. What a load of bollocks.

605
00:41:43,211 --> 00:41:44,796
Look, I tried, all right?

606
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:46,923
The kid doesn't want a part of me.

607
00:41:47,006 --> 00:41:48,006
So fuck him.

608
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:54,554
Come on.

609
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:05,525
Lucy. I promise
we'll harvest your blubber.

610
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:07,443
Jesus Christ.

611
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:10,445
Deep.

612
00:42:11,572 --> 00:42:12,573
- Homelander.
- Hey.

613
00:42:12,657 --> 00:42:13,615
- Hey.
- What happened?

614
00:42:13,616 --> 00:42:15,536
- They killed her. They killed her, man.
- What?

615
00:42:15,618 --> 00:42:17,912
I was trying to help out.
I got some intel on the boat.

616
00:42:17,995 --> 00:42:20,373
We started to cut them off,
and they ran right into her.

617
00:42:20,456 --> 00:42:22,917
I'm sorry. I tried to stop them.
I tried to cut them off.

618
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,003
Okay. You're saying
there's people with the terrorist?

619
00:42:26,087 --> 00:42:28,172
Look at me.
You're saying they're not alone.

620
00:42:28,256 --> 00:42:31,008
- I think so.
- Did you get a good look at them?

621
00:42:31,092 --> 00:42:33,803
Not really.
I was too busy worrying about Lucy.

622
00:42:33,886 --> 00:42:35,596
Oh, Jesus. Right. Lucy.

623
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,765
But I think they went off
in the storm drains.

624
00:42:37,849 --> 00:42:39,016
Can't be too far.

625
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:43,271
Uh, who invited you, exactly?

626
00:42:43,354 --> 00:42:44,354
Starlight.

627
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:47,066
Listen, what I did was unforgivable.

628
00:42:47,692 --> 00:42:50,236
I'm going to do everything
in my power to renew my light.

629
00:42:51,237 --> 00:42:53,906
Not just for you but for all
the female people I've offended.

630
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:57,535
Renew your light? Did you just fucking
join the Church of the Collective?

631
00:42:57,618 --> 00:42:59,662
- Maybe.
- You're an idiot.

632
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:03,124
Hey, easy on the religious persecution,
okay, new girl?

633
00:43:03,207 --> 00:43:06,335
Starlight, maybe one day
you can welcome me back into The Seven,

634
00:43:06,419 --> 00:43:08,421
but I know my road is long and hard.

635
00:43:08,504 --> 00:43:09,672
Are you serious?

636
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:16,012
There is no fucking way
you're coming back.

637
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:19,265
- There's no need for language.
- All right, enough.

638
00:43:19,348 --> 00:43:21,642
We do not have time for this.

639
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:28,316
Look, I am with you, sister, but first
we have to go get the terrorist, okay?

640
00:43:32,695 --> 00:43:33,946
Everyone in the tunnels.

641
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:35,907
- Yeah, everyone in the tunnels.
- Not you.

642
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,328
Anyone gets eyeballs on the target,
he's mine, understood?

643
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:42,329
Go get them.

644
00:43:43,164 --> 00:43:44,164
Noir.

645
00:43:44,582 --> 00:43:48,544
All right, you need to hang back a bit.

646
00:43:48,628 --> 00:43:49,754
- Okay?
- Okay.

647
00:43:49,837 --> 00:43:52,757
Still got some work to do with the ladies,
but it's gonna be okay.

648
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,634
- You'll be back in no time.
- Really?

649
00:43:54,717 --> 00:43:55,718
Sure.

650
00:43:56,302 --> 00:43:58,930
One other thing, you...
You ripped your vest.

651
00:44:00,223 --> 00:44:02,558
- What?
- Your gill is showing.

652
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:04,477
Cover it up.

653
00:44:05,061 --> 00:44:06,062
It's disgusting.

654
00:44:33,548 --> 00:44:36,384
Come on. Come on.

655
00:44:50,356 --> 00:44:51,440
You okay?

656
00:44:52,692 --> 00:44:55,236
Yep. I just need a little rehab.

657
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:56,445
I'll be fine.

658
00:44:59,156 --> 00:45:00,156
Yeah.

659
00:45:01,701 --> 00:45:03,244
I know you will, A-Train.

660
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:51,751
You got my message.

661
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:55,211
Annie, I...

662
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,782
Oh, come on.
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

663
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:26,535
This guy? Again?

664
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:28,162
- I did not know...
- Shut it.

665
00:46:28,788 --> 00:46:30,915
What, do you got rocks
in your fucking head?

666
00:46:31,999 --> 00:46:32,999
Come here.

667
00:46:34,585 --> 00:46:35,585
All right.

668
00:46:36,545 --> 00:46:39,048
I'd like you to do something for me, okay?

669
00:46:41,467 --> 00:46:42,467
Kill him.

670
00:46:45,513 --> 00:46:46,513
Wait...

671
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:50,184
No, he... He's wanted.

672
00:46:50,267 --> 00:46:52,395
Shouldn't we take him to the police?

673
00:46:52,478 --> 00:46:54,981
Yes, he is. Yes, we should.

674
00:46:56,857 --> 00:46:59,276
Kill him. Right now.

675
00:47:00,945 --> 00:47:02,530
Chicks. Right, Hughie?

676
00:47:02,613 --> 00:47:04,991
Oh, for God's sakes. Come on. It's easy.

677
00:47:06,075 --> 00:47:08,619
Hands in the air,
like you just don't care.

678
00:47:10,121 --> 00:47:11,121
Kill him.

679
00:47:13,791 --> 00:47:14,791
Do it.

680
00:47:21,382 --> 00:47:22,967
More incentive? Okay.

681
00:47:23,551 --> 00:47:26,554
You kill him,
or I'll fucking kill you both.

682
00:47:32,101 --> 00:47:33,101
Do it.

683
00:47:45,406 --> 00:47:46,824
Oi, cunt.

684
00:47:50,494 --> 00:47:51,494
William?

685
00:47:51,954 --> 00:47:54,040
What a surprise.

686
00:47:55,249 --> 00:47:59,879
Hey, you know, I had a great breakfast
with your wife this morning.

687
00:47:59,962 --> 00:48:01,380
Pancakes.

688
00:48:02,798 --> 00:48:04,550
Delicious.

689
00:48:05,926 --> 00:48:06,926
Yeah.

690
00:48:08,095 --> 00:48:10,056
Eat this, motherfucker.

691
00:48:30,701 --> 00:48:33,079
Please. Don't.

692
00:48:43,255 --> 00:48:45,883
Come on, Hughie.
Before that cunt gets out.

693
00:48:50,262 --> 00:48:51,305
Come on.

694
00:49:07,113 --> 00:49:09,198
Please.

695
00:49:09,657 --> 00:49:13,452
I love you.

696
00:49:15,454 --> 00:49:17,039
I love you, too.

697
00:49:17,123 --> 00:49:18,499
Hey, guys!

698
00:49:19,083 --> 00:49:20,251
Call the foul!

699
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:37,476
Dad...

700
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,566
Dad, are you okay? Dad?

701
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:26,335
Aw.

702
00:51:26,418 --> 00:51:29,755
Can't do your magic little hand thingy
anymore? How come?

703
00:51:50,192 --> 00:51:51,402
Open your eyes.

704
00:51:52,695 --> 00:51:53,904
Open your eyes.

705
00:51:55,864 --> 00:51:57,866
I like to see the light go out.

706
00:52:04,081 --> 00:52:06,125
Fucking yellow bastard.

707
00:52:07,876 --> 00:52:08,876
Ugh.

708
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,029
I said he was mine.

709
00:52:42,536 --> 00:52:44,788
You snooze, you lose, Gramps.

710
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:19,448
I know the news of Compound V
came as a shock to everyone.

711
00:53:19,531 --> 00:53:20,866
As you can imagine,

712
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:23,369
this has been a very difficult day
for the Vought family.

713
00:53:24,161 --> 00:53:27,831
Our focus now will be to learn the truth.

714
00:53:28,332 --> 00:53:32,753
As I said, we are conducting
a robust investigation into Compound V.

715
00:53:32,836 --> 00:53:37,925
But let me be clear.
I had no knowledge whatsoever.

716
00:53:38,008 --> 00:53:42,888
We believe it was the work
of a small disaffected group of scientists

717
00:53:42,971 --> 00:53:47,226
led by former Vought employee
Madelyn Stillwell.

718
00:53:47,851 --> 00:53:51,772
But sadly,
there are more important matters at hand.

719
00:53:51,855 --> 00:53:53,107
Everyone at Vought

720
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:55,526
<i>sends their thoughts and prayers</i>

721
00:53:55,609 --> 00:53:58,779
<i>to those families
that were affected today.</i>

722
00:53:59,446 --> 00:54:01,365
<i>Though it is important to acknowledge</i>

723
00:54:01,448 --> 00:54:04,368
<i>that this tragic event
could have been far worse.</i>

724
00:54:04,451 --> 00:54:06,036
<i>Today's attack underscores</i>

725
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,206
<i>just how dangerous the threat
of super-terrorists has become.</i>

726
00:54:09,289 --> 00:54:14,002
<i>And at a time like this,
America needs its heroes more than ever.</i>

727
00:54:14,503 --> 00:54:16,505
<i>We live in a dangerous world.</i>

728
00:54:16,588 --> 00:54:20,384
<i>Our brave heroes
were already fighting terrorists overseas,</i>

729
00:54:20,467 --> 00:54:25,889
<i>but now America faces this war
on a different front: right here at home.</i>

730
00:54:25,973 --> 00:54:27,808
<i>These enemies will stop at nothing</i>

731
00:54:27,891 --> 00:54:30,310
<i>to infiltrate our borders
and attack our citizens.</i>

732
00:54:30,394 --> 00:54:34,398
<i>Our superheroes
are the last line of defence.</i>

733
00:54:34,481 --> 00:54:37,276
<i>And today's death toll
would've been much higher</i>

734
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:42,281
<i>had it not been for the brave actions
of our newest hero, Stormfront,</i>

735
00:54:42,364 --> 00:54:46,076
<i>who stopped the terrorist
before he could take more innocent lives.</i>

736
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,580
<i>I don't want to imagine
what would've happened</i>

737
00:54:49,663 --> 00:54:51,790
<i>if Stormfront hadn't been there...</i>

738
00:55:08,682 --> 00:55:11,977
<i>America is truly blessed to have her.</i>

739
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,188
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Stormfront.</i>

740
00:55:27,951 --> 00:55:30,287
<i>Thank you, but we all know</i>

741
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:32,956
<i>who the real heroes
of this group are, right?</i>

742
00:55:33,957 --> 00:55:35,792
<i>The people you see behind you.</i>

743
00:55:35,876 --> 00:55:38,253
<i>The people who are struggling every day.</i>

744
00:55:38,337 --> 00:55:39,630
<i>Let's give them all a hand.</i>

745
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,487
<i>- How did you know what to do?
- Stormfront, here!</i>

746
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:06,114
<i>Stormfront, over here, please!</i>

747
00:56:06,198 --> 00:56:07,574
<i>Stormfront, look over here!</i>
