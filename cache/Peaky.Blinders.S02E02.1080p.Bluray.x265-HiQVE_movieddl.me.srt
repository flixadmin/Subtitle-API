494
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,080
Mrs Johnson?

495
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,320
Yes. Who are you?

496
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,120
I'm from Birmingham Council,
Bordesley parish.

497
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,520
No-one wrote to me. What do you want?

498
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,160
I would like to talk about your son,
about Henry.

499
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,720
Can I come in?

500
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,440
Oh, I'd rather you didn't,
he doesn't like to talk about this.

502
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,480
So what does Henry know
about his real identity, Mrs Johnson?

503
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,720
I only deal with Mr Ross from the agency
and he only ever writes, so...

504
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,360
Why are you here in person?

505
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,960
Well, the boy is approaching
his 18th birthday.

You're not from the council,

508
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,280
Hmm. What does he know, Mrs Johnson?

509
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,840
He knows his mother couldn't cope.

510
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,320
She drank too much, she used opium.

511
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,440
She used to beat him.

512
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,480
But that isn't the truth, is it?

513

Look, I think you should come back
when my husband's here.

514
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,400
Does he know what his real name is?

515
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,680
His real name is Johnson, Henry Johnson,

516
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,160
now I would like you to go away
and come back when my husband's here.

517
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,600
The truth is, he was taken
from his mother without her permission.

518
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,640
Henry, go back inside, please.

00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,440
Um... You do it, I can't read it.

649
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,960
After Anna was taken from you,
she was put with a...

650
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,360
With a family of a
railway station master in Stafford.

651
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,280
She never settled.

652
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,440
So she kept running away.

653
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,440
She got on a train to Birmingham once...

654
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,520
Eventually they sent her to Australia

655
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,760
where she died of something
called spring fever.

656
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,560
So my little Anna travel led
all the way back across the world

657
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,440
to be with me in my dreams?

658
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,440
She came all by herself.

659
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,120
Well...

660
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,640
That's one train
they couldn't get her off.

661

-And?

667

Okay, Polly, listen to me.

668

Just listen to me, please.

Pol!

670
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,400
The woman that he calls "mother"
will never let him come here.

671
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,760
Just tell me where he is, Tommy.

672

Polly, if you go there and you get mad

673
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,040
and she gets mad
and she calls the police,

674

they will never let you
anywhere near him

675

Pulling the gun is why I can't tell you.

Pol, I'm sorry, you're going
to have to wait till he's 18.

Till he's old enough
to make his own decision.
