1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,162
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,563
After five years in hell,
I have come home with only one goal:

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,609
To save my city.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,489
Now others have joined my crusade.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,963
To them, I'm Oliver Queen.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,964
To the rest of Starling City,
lam someone else.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,330
I am something else.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,686
Previously on Arrow:

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,649
I want you to take my place.

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,451
I want you to become the next Ra's al Ghul.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,886
- Maseo.
- My master sees something in you.

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,362
Don't let your recalcitrance
take any more lives.

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,807
Oliver.

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,161
Oliver, we have to stop this guy before
he puts arrows in any more criminals.

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,561
Or before he starts putting them
in innocent people.

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,566
I think you're letting personal feelings
towards the Arrow cloud your judgment.

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,200
Maybe I'm seeing things more clearly
than I have for the last few years.

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,448
Enough, both of you. I am tired of... Unh!

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,811
This is Captain Lance.
City Hall. Shots fired.

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,962
Suspect on the move.
I need ESU and an ambulance now.

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,889
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,086
We have confirmation that Mayor Castle...

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,242
...was pronounced dead at the scene.

24
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,889
Palmer Technology CEO Ray Palmer
was taken to Starling General Hospital...

25
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,247
...where he is listed
in critical condition.

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,641
I tried to call Felicity.
She's not answering.

27
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,168
S. C.P.D. Captain Quentin Lance
was present for the attack...

28
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,488
...and had this to say on the incident:

29
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,610
I just requested a first-degree
murder warrant for the Arrow...

30
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,491
...and re-instated
the anti-vigilante task force...

31
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,961
...with shoot-to-kill orders if necessary.

32
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,329
Why would the Arrow suddenly
decide to assassinate the mayor?

33
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,165
I don't know. But I should've
trusted my first instinct...

34
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,802
...that this man is a
killer and a criminal.

35
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,008
If I had, Mayor Castle
might still be alive.

36
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,969
- No more questions.
- He could be right.

37
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,770
Don't think like that.
We have to deal with the problem at hand.

38
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,810
The murders are being orchestrated
by one of Ra's' lieutenants.

39
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,325
Maseo Yamashiro.

40
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,450
- You sound like you know him.
- I thought I did. Lifetime ago.

41
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,806
The man is a stranger now.

42
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,531
Oliver, the question is,
where do we find this stranger?

43
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,001
I know someone who can help with that.

44
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,640
Who are those men?

45
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,006
I don't know.

46
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,527
Then why are we running away from them?

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,525
Shado?

48
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,927
What? How'd you know my sister?

49
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,169
Your, uh... Your sister?

50
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,130
- My twin. How do you know Shado?
- Oliver.

51
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,523
It's a long story. My friend and I
are in a little bit of trouble.

52
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,126
Uh, we're wondering if you could help us
get off the street.

53
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,721
- What's going on?
- That's also a long story.

54
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,002
Can you help us?

55
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,641
Okay, listen up.

56
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,883
Suspect is armed and dangerous.
No warning shots.

57
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,401
Whatever happened to innocent
until proven guilty?

58
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,927
He was on that rooftop.
I saw him with my own eyes.

59
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,730
- He's being framed.
- By a copycat.

60
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,924
Wouldn't be happening
if he wasn't dressed up like Robin Hood.

61
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,161
That's not fair.

62
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,164
You don't understand what's happening.
I need you to trust me.

63
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,967
I used to.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,243
- Who is he? Just tell me his name or I'll...
- What, Dad?

65
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,005
You'll charge me as an accessory?

66
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,606
I'll do what needs to be done.
This has to end.

67
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,686
And it has to end tonight.

68
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,807
I am the biggest idiot in the world
for breaking up with you.

69
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,842
Remember the last time we did this?

70
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,487
We were gonna run away together.

71
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,208
Why don't we?

72
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,364
Roy.

73
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,408
Things are complicated
with Oliver right now.

74
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,290
Ra's al Ghul complicated?

75
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,526
Oh, my God.

76
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,041
In the wake of the attacks, Captain Lance
has issued an arrest warrant...

77
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,368
...for the vigilante known as the Arrow...

78
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,491
...as the largest manhunt
in the city's history is underway.

79
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,008
Captain Lance confirmed that
arrest warrants have also been issued...

80
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,527
...for each of the Arrow's accomplices.

81
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,485
Ray?

82
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,325
H9)'-

83
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,165
Hi. How are you?

84
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,005
Well, you're here, so I'm great.

85
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,167
Mr. Palmer, how are you feeling?

86
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,687
You have a not-so-good look on your face.

87
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,285
You see his face?

88
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,811
I've got some bad news.

89
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,442
During the surgery to remove the arrow,
you developed a thrombus.

90
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,329
- A blood clot?
- If left untreated...

91
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,687
...it could cause an ischemic stroke.

92
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,525
- Then maybe we should treat it.
- It's not that simple.

93
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,523
Your injuries have left you very weak.

94
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,809
A craniotomy could end up
doing more harm than good.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,210
- And by harm you mean...?
- Brain damage at best.

96
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,491
At worst...

97
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,042
So you're saying basically that if we
have the surgery now, I could die.

98
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,568
And if we wait and the clot moves,
I could die.

99
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,527
What if I told you that I invented
a bunch of teeny-tiny robots...

100
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,321
...that were capable of entering
my bloodstream, traveling to the clot...

101
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,005
...and shrinking it?

102
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,403
All without damaging my brain
or any other organ in my body.

103
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,807
- I'd say you need a psych eval.
- Heh.

104
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,086
Okay.

105
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,245
But after, we go to my lab,
get the nanotech...

106
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,802
...inject it, and publish the results
in the New England Journal of Medicine.

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,890
Well, I'm sorry,
but that's simply not possible.

108
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,168
Uh, I invented the tech. It's possible.

109
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,689
Starling General has a very strict policy
against experimental procedures.

110
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,525
Wait, there is a procedure
that could save his life...

111
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,520
...and you're saying you won't perform it?
I'm saying I can't perform it.

112
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,720
The hospital won't permit the use
of an experimental or untested technology.

113
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,767
How do you know your invention
won't kill you?

114
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,410
- I don't. It's a risk.
- I'm very sorry.

115
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,603
But there's really nothing I can do.

116
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,250
We'll figure something out.

117
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,960
Ray Palmer.

118
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,883
Even in a hospital bed, you're the most
handsome man I've ever seen.

119
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,802
Can you give us a minute?

120
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,485
Hi.

121
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,650
I heard what happened,
so I caught the first flight out of Vegas.

122
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,041
So tell me, what are the doctors saying?

123
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,329
Absolutely nothing good.

124
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,131
Okay, okay. Hey.

125
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,404
At least you finally have a boyfriend.

126
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,207
Mom.

127
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,324
How did you know I was still in Starling?

128
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,806
- Laurel.
- I need your help, Nyssa.

129
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,320
Maseo is also in Starling.

130
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,524
He's behind the murders
the Arrow's suspected of.

131
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,082
Sarab does my father's bidding
in an effort to force you to do the same...

132
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,921
...and take your place as his heir.
And do you feel betrayed by that?

133
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,046
Not so much
that I'd betray him by helping you.

134
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,486
People are dying, Nyssa.

135
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,367
What makes you think
that's any concern of mine?

136
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,720
Sara.

137
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,808
What would she want you to do?

138
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,364
I have Maseo's location.

139
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,483
A building called Magnuson Plaza.

140
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,405
Yeah, the company that owns that building
went belly-up a few months back.

141
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,722
The League has been
using it as a safe house...

142
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,484
...and staging ground for its attacks.

143
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,880
How'd you find this out?

144
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,966
I am Daughter of the Demon.

145
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,842
Your primary concern
should be the League.

146
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,726
You can place Maseo in the same cage
you put me in but my father has an army.

147
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,564
- One step at a time.
- Oliver.

148
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,321
We have to spread out
if we're gonna cover that.

149
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,482
- Dig, I want you on overwatch.
- Copy that.

150
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,768
What about her?

151
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,968
Don't confuse information...

152
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,521
...with the willingness
to take up arms against the League.

153
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,327
We appreciate what you've done.
We'll take it from here.

154
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,285
Let's do this.

155
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,249
We scoped out every floor. Nothing.

156
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,765
Same with the parking garage.

157
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,927
- Diggle.
- North side is clear.

158
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,326
You think Nyssa played us?

159
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,881
Hang on, I got movement.

160
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,805
Upper level, southwest corner.

161
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,444
Clearly, I chose well
selecting you as my heir.

162
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,923
Killing me will only win you
the mantle you reject.

163
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,161
It will stop you.

164
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,842
I have legions who live
only to see my will done.

165
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,324
No, boy, you have but two choices.

166
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,966
You either ascend
to the calling of Ra's al Ghul...

167
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,283
...or you will spend the rest of your days
in a cage.

168
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,363
You're not gonna take me prisoner.

169
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,410
No, I'm not.

170
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,327
This is the Starling City police.

171
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,323
Put your weapons down and your hands up.

172
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,687
You're all under arrest.

173
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,722
On the ground. Get on the ground!

174
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,490
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

175
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,411
Lock down this entire area.
Three-block radius.

176
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,724
- Diggle?
- I got eyes on them. Blues everywhere.

177
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,770
Suspects
headed east on 8th. Keep them pinned.

178
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,651
Warehouse door. West side.
Get there, you're in the clear.

179
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,410
Go, move.
Four more headed your way.

180
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,210
You gotta move, move, move.

181
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,482
Put your hands in the air.

182
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,402
Go for the door. I'll draw their fire.

183
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,484
- We're not separating.
- They don't want you. They want me.

184
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,449
Now, go.

185
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,607
Cooper, Jones, box them in on 43rd.

186
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,201
Two masks in a warehouse,
west side of 43rd.

187
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,964
Proceeding to warehouse.

188
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,690
He's headed toward the east exit.

189
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,125
This way. Take him.

190
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,324
Laurel.

191
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,764
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna shoot your own daughter?

192
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,610
No, but I'm thinking about arresting you.

193
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,683
A night in jail would bring you
to your senses.

194
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,360
Daddy, please. Please don't do this.

195
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,444
- Leave her alone.
- Nyssa.

196
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,604
- Don't hurt him.
- Laurel, what are you doing?

197
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,290
We must go.

198
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,801
I'm sorry.

199
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,887
Did Arsenal and Canary get away?

200
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,849
Diggle.

201
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,486
Diggle.

202
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,927
Get back!

203
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,411
Get in.

204
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,165
I see a black, late model
vehicle in the area.

205
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,443
Get to the tunnel off 8th, we're good.
If we clear those squad cars.

206
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,051
On it.

207
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,245
H9)'-

208
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,930
Thank God. I got so worried.

209
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,287
It's okay. I'm okay.

210
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,327
Where's Roy?

211
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,247
He's still out there.

212
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,086
- It's like the whole city has lost their minds.
- It's not the whole city.

213
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,129
It's just one man.

214
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,129
- Yup.
- Hello, captain.

215
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,203
I got three men in the hospital
because of you.

216
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,601
I understand that you feel betrayed.

217
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,808
But you can't be so angry as to think...

218
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,123
...that I'm just running around
taking aim at innocent people.

219
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,443
I don't think anything.
I know this madness has to end.

220
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,803
You don't want any more people
getting hurt, you turn yourself in.

221
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,487
Yeah, that's what I thought.

222
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,648
I'm sorry. He's in a lot of pain.

223
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,811
I thought that if we stopped Maseo,
we'd stop the killings.

224
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,725
But Nyssa was right.
This extends way beyond him.

225
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,807
- Roy.
- I'm okay.

226
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,167
I got clear somewhere around Hudson.

227
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,209
I had to shoot a few officers.

228
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,330
But they're just flesh wounds.

229
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,170
I've underestimated Ra's.

230
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,051
And now we're all paying the price.

231
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,324
- I'm sorry.
- What are you talking about?

232
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,767
Ra's is after us because of Malcolm.

233
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,964
What don't I know?

234
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,484
You haven't told me your names. I'm Mei.

235
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,484
- I'm Akio. And this is...
- Tommy.

236
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,885
So, Tommy, who are you
and your little friend running from?

237
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,651
It's complicated.

238
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,691
But, Mei, the truth is that I don't know
why this person has sent men after us...

239
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,484
...but she did.

240
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,043
Is that your father?

241
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,126
His name is Yao Fei.
And how do you know my sister?

242
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,165
Oh, uh, medical school.

243
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,202
She never mentioned any American friends.

244
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,845
You are American, aren't you?

245
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,642
I dropped out. Of, uh, medical school,
not of America.

246
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,883
So when was the last time
you saw my sister?

247
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,281
It's been a while.

248
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,288
For me too.

249
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,686
Shado and my father disappeared
three years ago now.

250
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,361
Police think they were kidnapped,
but no ransom came.

251
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,285
I'm so sorry.

252
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,805
The police tell me they must be dead.

253
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,721
If they were, at least
I'd have some closure.

254
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,566
But each time the phone rings,
someone knocks at the door...

255
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,200
...or when I meet someone
who knew them...

256
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,249
I can't imagine.

257
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,891
You must be tired.

258
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,209
Dirty. I need a shower.

259
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,326
My bedroom's through that door.
There are fresh towels.

260
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,129
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

261
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,410
I'll entertain your friend.

262
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,121
Thank you.

263
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,805
Listen, I'm a cop, not a psychologist.

264
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,887
But in my experience, killers don't
discriminate between guilty and innocent.

265
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,482
They kill because they view themselves
as being above the law.

266
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,608
And the Arrow is no different.

267
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,527
He is a criminal, and I promise you,
we will find him and hold him accountable.

268
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,808
- It's real easy to look the other way when...
- Oh.

269
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,450
- You okay?
- Mm-hm.

270
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,806
Thanks for getting this.

271
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,970
I ran into Dr. Lockhart in the cafeteria.
I thought maybe...

272
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,647
...I don't know, I could talk him
into giving Ray those nano-thingies.

273
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,643
- Nanotech.
- He wouldn't even look at me.

274
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,928
Have you seen this dress? Hello.

275
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,764
Man's an idiot.

276
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,290
Iguessu.

277
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,126
...you're just gonna have to inject
those tiny robot things into Ray yourself.

278
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,931
Great plan, except I'm not a doctor.

279
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,841
Even Ray said that they could kill him.
I'm not gonna be the one to risk his life.

280
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,610
His life is already at risk.

281
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,650
You're saying you don't wanna
be the one to take the chance.

282
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,643
- If your father were here...
- He would be arrested.

283
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,444
Probably.

284
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,324
But right before that,
he would tell you that sometimes...

285
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,005
...we gotta take a chance.

286
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,845
Particularly for the people we care about.

287
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,401
I don't give a damn about budgets.
This is a manhunt.

288
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,485
Now, approve the extra personnel
and the overtime, and you do it now.

289
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,564
I apologize for the coarse treatment.

290
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,886
I didn't think I'd get you
to speak with me of your own accord.

291
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,689
- You're him.
- Ra's al Ghul.

292
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,043
It's an honor to meet you.
Sara spoke with such love about her father.

293
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,521
That's my daughter's name.

294
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,484
If she'd never met you,
she'd still be alive now.

295
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,007
If Sara had not met my daughter...

296
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,044
...she would've starved to death
on the shores of Lian Yu.

297
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,605
She was never on Lian Yu.

298
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,930
You suffer false perception.

299
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,125
One of many, I'm afraid.

300
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,091
Listen, what do you want?

301
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,089
To help the city as your daughter did.

302
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,202
- You hunt for the man they call the Arrow.
- Yeah.

303
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,445
Are you gonna help me find him?

304
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,771
You'll be able to find him easily...

305
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,927
...once I tell you his name.

306
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,962
And why would I believe
just any name that you throw at me?

307
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,600
Well, because with this revelation...

308
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,445
...everything will become clear.

309
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,962
And you will realize...

310
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,165
...that the man you've been looking for has
been right in front of you the entire time.

311
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,169
The same man who lied...

312
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,563
...telling you he wasn't with Sara
on Lian Yu.

313
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,124
Oliver Queen is the Arrow.

314
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,129
We need to talk.

315
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,326
Aren't you tired of these chats?
I know I am.

316
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,967
Then let's cut the crap. You don't think
the Arrow's behind the murders...

317
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,488
...you're just pissed off because he kept
Sara's death a secret from you.

318
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,326
That is not why. That is not why!

319
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,165
I mean, maybe at first. Yeah.

320
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,803
But then I realized,
he is the reason Sara got killed.

321
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,083
- Dad, that is ridiculous.
- No. You, Harper, Sara...

322
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,642
...the freak in Central City, Huntress.
I got a new guy flying around.

323
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,963
All these masks, they started with him.

324
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,481
And Sara died only because
she was part of it too.

325
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,331
You have no idea why Sara was killed.

326
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,928
She ended up in the League of Assassins...

327
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,845
...because she was marooned
on Lian Yu...

328
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,082
...because she got on that boat
with Queen.

329
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,805
So what?

330
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,571
Now Oliver's to blame?

331
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,367
Oliver, the Arrow. Either way, same guy.

332
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,964
On some level, I think I always knew.

333
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,369
When I thought he was doing good,
it didn't matter to me.

334
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,243
You know, when that boat went down
and we thought Sara was dead?

335
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,970
I blamed Queen.

336
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,724
It's funny how things
come full circle, right?

337
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,521
Well, I got things to do.

338
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,205
You calling him?

339
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,405
It's too late. I got officers headed
to his home, his sister's club, everywhere.

340
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,409
Uh, for what it's worth, I'm thinking
of starting a reality TV show, so...

341
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,364
...maybe I already have brain damage.

342
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,005
Don't joke, Mr. Palmer.

343
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,043
The next few hours are critical.

344
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,921
I'm going to want to keep you
under close observation.

345
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,366
1335"?

346
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,931
No, no, no. It's nothing... Ow!

347
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,363
I think my back is spasming.
Oh, it hurts... Oh.

348
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,723
Oh, gosh, you're so strong.

349
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,123
Ow. Oh, my God. I think I...
I think I'm gonna faint.

350
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,282
- Maybe we should get you on a gurney.
- Yeah.

351
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,410
Oh, yeah. I'll just get on a gurney. Ow.

352
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,281
Ow. I'm sorry.

353
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,368
Is your mom gonna be okay?

354
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,925
Oh...

355
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,802
I think she'll make a miraculous
recovery in about five minutes.

356
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,805
- Just like you.
- Is that my nanotech?

357
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,328
Assuming the organizational system
in your lab is accurate.

358
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,766
Uh...

359
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,241
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- Aren't you?

360
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,809
Yeah. I mean, my alternatives
are brain damage or death...

361
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,765
...but if the hospital finds out,
you could go to jail.

362
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,009
I'll take my chances.

363
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,491
Okay. All right.

364
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,723
- How do we feel?
- Uh, normal...

365
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,410
...but I wasn't expecting any side...

366
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,201
Ray? Ray? Ray?

367
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,771
Hey! He)'-

368
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,971
Hi.

369
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,001
Okay, well...

370
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,601
...maybe there are some side effects.

371
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,807
- I can't believe this is happening.
- Line forms behind me.

372
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,203
The citywide manhunt
for the Arrow continues this evening...

373
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,364
...as Captain Lance has made
capturing this dangerous vigilante...

374
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,728
...the S. C. P. D.'s top priority.

375
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,803
I'm sure those cops
that chased you are fine.

376
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,724
I shot them with arrows, Thea.

377
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,248
When it was happening,
there was a part of me that...

378
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,206
- That felt relieved.
- Relieved?

379
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,647
That I'd finally be going to jail.

380
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,882
That I'd get what I deserved.

381
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,562
Roy, listen to me.

382
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,370
The only thing that you deserve
is to be happy, okay?

383
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,325
You've got to find a way
to forgive yourself.

384
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,568
What happened with that cop last year...

385
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,564
...it's not your fault.

386
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,404
Sorry that you had to go through this.

387
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,371
Roy, I gave you that mask...

388
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,044
...so you could help the police,
not run from them.

389
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,320
What's going to happen?

390
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,970
- Oh.
- Run.

391
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,565
S.C.P.D.!

392
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,206
- Freeze!
- Put your hands in the air!

393
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,768
Thank you for the shower.

394
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,849
- You okay?
- I saw the tattoo on your back.

395
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,326
Why have you been lying to me?

396
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,451
- Oh. Mei...
- I need to know what happened to my family.

397
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,609
- I don't know.
- Another lie.

398
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,280
You knew my sister.
You were more than just friends.

399
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,967
Just believe me when I say the less
you know about me, the safer you'll be.

400
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,441
Fine, maybe you'll be more honest
with the police.

401
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,602
You're upset. Please don't call the police.

402
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,962
I already did. They'll be here any minute.

403
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,964
- Akio, we have to go.
- What's wrong?

404
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,841
Get down!

405
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,651
Why are the police shooting?

406
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,121
Because they're not the police!

407
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,489
I am so proud of you. I'm so proud...

408
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,483
Your father would be proud of you.

409
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,847
He's not exactly a role model, but...

410
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,327
Oh, Ms. Smoak.
Just the person I wanted to see.

411
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,371
Do you know what these are?
They're Mr. Palmer's latest MRI.

412
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,928
- The clot in his brain is gone.
- Really?

413
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,566
Not moved, not smaller, gone.

414
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,485
He's going to make a full recovery.

415
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,483
You wouldn't happen to know anything...

416
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,524
...about this unprecedented
medical development, would you?

417
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,767
Huh?

418
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,003
You accusing my daughter of something?
I work a table at Caesar's...

419
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,322
...frequented by no less
than three lawyers.

420
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,444
Thank you, please.
Thank you all for coming.

421
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,802
We've had a breakthrough
in our investigation...

422
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,691
...of the vigilante known as the Arrow.

423
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,164
The District Attorney's office
has just issued an arrest warrant...

424
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,167
...for the person responsible
for these acts of violence.

425
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,963
I had nowhere else to go.

426
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,525
It's okay.

427
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,520
Lyla took Sara to her mother's.

428
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,966
- Lance knows.
- The whole city knows, Oliver.

429
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,846
Mr. Queen should be considered
armed and highly dangerous.

430
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,691
But make no mistake, he will be found...

431
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,042
...and brought to justice.

432
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,644
A stunning development...

433
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,406
...as Oliver Queen has been outed
as the Arrow.

434
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,040
The accusation comes
as a particular surprise...

435
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,165
...considering that Queen was exonerated
of being the Arrow only two years ago.

436
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,566
News lady's right.

437
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,882
You put this genie back
in the bottle before.

438
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,082
Last time I had it all worked out.

439
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,644
Getting arrested was my plan.
This time it's Ra's al Ghul's.

440
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,731
Come in.

441
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,365
- How's Ray?
- So much better than you right now.

442
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,523
Please tell me you have a brilliant plan.

443
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,370
I don't even have a regular plan.

444
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,086
What about Dig going out as the Arrow?
Worked last time.

445
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,050
But this time Lance won't rest
until Oliver's in custody.

446
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,281
You have to leave.
You have to get out of town.

447
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,888
My father's posted men at every
bus station, train station and airport.

448
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,410
Also, he's frozen Thea's assets.

449
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,722
He's not giving you anything
you can use to run.

450
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,605
I can't believe this is happening.

451
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,886
- You think Ra's planned this the entire time?
- He's using this city as a weapon.

452
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,886
It's my city.

453
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,885
Where you going, Oliver?

454
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,642
Only place I can go.

455
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,122
- Akio, you okay?
- I'm okay.

456
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,527
- What's happening?
- Front door the only way in?

457
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,485
- Yes.
- Get low, take Akio to the bedroom.

458
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,927
Mei, they're coming to kill you too.

459
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,889
Go, go! Come on!

460
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,648
Akio? Akio?

461
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,569
We followed them.
They work for Amanda Waller.

462
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,880
Who is she?

463
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,326
How are you feeling?

464
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,721
For a guy who just avoided death
and/or brain damage? Pretty good.

465
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,886
Good.

466
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,208
But are you okay?

467
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,164
It's, uh...

468
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,531
It's a long story. I'm just glad...

469
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,326
...that you're all right.
Thanks to you.

470
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,729
Oh, I think your nanotech
deserves some of the credit.

471
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,245
All I did was stick something in you.
You think there will ever come a time...

472
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,085
...when everything I say
isn't some weird double entendre?

473
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,130
I hope not.
It's one of your more charming traits.

474
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,484
That and the fact
that you had the courage to save my life...

475
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,365
...are just two
of the many reasons that I love you.

476
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,084
Wow.

477
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,206
That's a really nice thing to hear.

478
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,768
Especially after everything
that's going on.

479
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,084
With the blood clot, and the nanotech,
and the nearly dying.

480
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:16,205
Speaking of,
you must be starving after all that drama.

481
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,200
I'm gonna go find a hospital nurse
and get you some of that hospital Jell-O.

482
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,768
Oh, my God. What just happened?

483
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,841
- Nothing.
- Felicity. Uh-uh-uh.

484
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,048
You look the way you did
when you were 7...

485
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,124
...and stole your father's electronics
to make a super computer.

486
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,970
Oh, my God. Did you and Ray
just do it in this hospital?

487
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,202
- Did you just have hospital sex?
- No... Ugh.

488
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,210
- I've always wanted to have hospital sex.
- Way TMI. Gross.

489
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,447
What?

490
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,250
He told me he loved me.

491
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,562
You didn't say it back?

492
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,450
Oh.

493
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,450
What is wrong with me?

494
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,404
He's brilliant.

495
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,444
He knows the plot to every
Doctor Who episode, all 34 seasons.

496
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,564
He looks like a Disney prince.
I mean, he's...

497
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,324
...practically the perfect man.

498
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,322
You don't love Ray...

499
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,524
...because you're in love with Oliver.

500
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,844
You don't even know Oliver.
You met him for, like, 10 seconds.

501
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,331
I knew it in five.

502
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,605
Honey, you lit up like Christmas
when he walked in the room.

503
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,807
He's...

504
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,203
...terminally unavailable.

505
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,601
And that was before.

506
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,649
- You haven't been watching the news.
- No, I don't. It depresses me.

507
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,246
But here's what doesn't.
My daughter has two men...

508
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,525
...who are both amazing,
which just means...

509
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,008
...she has to make a choice.

510
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,283
I want pictures of Queen
distributed to every officer, okay?

511
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,841
No, a current one.
One with the scruff he's wearing.

512
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,687
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

513
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,722
Captain Lance...

514
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,410
...I'm here to turn myself in.

515
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,130
Cuff him.

516
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,163
I got you 1O minutes with Oliver,
but let's make it five, all right?

517
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:39,001
It would not look good if these reporters
caught wind of you meeting with him.

518
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,287
Him and the three of you.

519
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,771
Makes sense.

520
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,125
You shouldn't be here.

521
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,129
Oliver, neither should you.

522
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,765
What were you thinking?

523
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,247
- Were you thinking?
- I was thinking clearly.

524
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,125
I asked Laurel to make a deal.

525
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,443
I turn myself in,
and all of you receive full immunity.

526
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,126
You know, Oliver,
you are out of your mind...

527
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,449
...if you think we're just gonna
let you take the fall for all of us.

528
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,245
I started all of this.

529
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,930
It's my fall to take.

530
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:30,648
And this is the best way to save lives,
including yours.

531
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,804
So stop worrying.

532
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,611
- I've been through worse than prison.
- This is insane.

533
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,888
How could we live with ourselves?

534
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,407
Roy, I'm just gonna need you to.

535
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:48,163
The only move that Ra's has left me
is telling the truth.

536
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,882
You have no idea...

537
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,129
...how powerful the truth can be.

538
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,890
Oliver, this is the wrong move.

539
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,445
John...

540
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,650
...you've followed me this far.

541
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,803
All of you have followed me this far...

542
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,847
...but I need you to follow me
just a little further...

543
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,128
...until it's over.

544
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,205
The bodies are taken care of.

545
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,125
- We should go.
- Just give us a minute.

546
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,445
I'm sorry about this.

547
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,723
They tried to kill us.

548
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,965
They weren't the cops.

549
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,210
They must've intercepted the call.

550
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,010
They're after you and the boy?

551
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,929
- You knew my sister. ls there any chance...
- Mei, it's...

552
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,405
This had nothing to do with Shado.

553
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,160
You have no idea
what it's like to live like this...

554
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,684
...looking for any kind of answer.

555
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,323
You were right that I knew your sister.

556
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,528
I loved her.

557
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,688
I knew your father too.

558
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,769
And your family...

559
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,611
...they saved my life more than once.

560
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,603
I don't understand.

561
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,001
The people that are after me...

562
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,287
They'll kill anyone
who knows too much about who I am.

563
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,046
- But Shado and my father...
- Mei.

564
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,203
They're gone.

565
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,240
I'm so sorry.

566
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,891
Thank you for telling me.

567
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,965
For three years now,
all I've wanted is to know the truth.

568
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,966
You have no idea
how powerful the truth can be.

569
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,405
We shouldn't stay here.

570
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,451
Thank you.

571
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,165
This isn't fair. This isn't right.

572
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,325
All Oliver has ever done
was protect people, help people.

573
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,324
We can't stay here.

574
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,166
This place isn't secure anymore.

575
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,848
And then what?
We just bug out and allow this to happen?

576
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,042
- Enjoy our new immunity?
- Roy, I don't know.

577
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,163
I have no idea.

578
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,607
If I did, you'd be
listening to it right now.

579
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,441
If any one of us were in there and Oliver
was here, he'd think of something.

580
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,927
And it wouldn't matter
what the consequences were.

581
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,328
Lian Yu.

582
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,644
What about it?

583
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,523
This, uh, Ra's character...

584
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:36,203
He told me that Sara
made it to the island with you.

585
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,811
You didn't feel like
sharing that with me? Huh?

586
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,650
I mean, I'm only her father.

587
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,166
I was.

588
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,966
When did you decide
you knew what was best for my family?

589
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,245
I love your family.

590
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,484
You got the right to remain silent.
Take it.

591
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,128
Just ask me what you want to know.

592
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,928
What do I want to know?

593
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,722
Well, was it worth it?

594
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,924
All the pain and misery
you brought back from that island.

595
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,401
Merlyn, Slade Wilson.

596
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,883
Wouldn't it be better if you died there?

597
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,369
The reason I came back was to try
and save the people of this city.

598
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,241
I hate to break it to you,
but saving people isn't your specialty.

599
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:29,209
Tommy, Hilton, your mother...

600
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,926
...my daughter.

601
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,648
And now you're set on killing Laurel too.

602
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,931
I didn't want her to be involved in this.

603
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,407
I didn't want anyone to
be involved in this.

604
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,204
But you involved me.

605
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,402
You spent a year
making me look like a fool.

606
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,126
You spent a year
making me your accomplice.

607
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,248
You have any idea what you've done, huh?

608
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,967
What you've done to all of us,
to the people you claim to care about?

609
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,443
You've made us criminals.
You've made us liars and victims.

610
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,243
You, Mr. Queen, are not a hero.

611
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,570
You're a villain.

612
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,128
But you know that, don't you?

613
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,884
- What the hell are your people doing?
- I told them to stand down.

614
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,283
I guess your word carries as much weight
with them as it does with me.

615
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,401
Get down on the ground!

616
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,606
Get down on the ground!

617
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,729
You've got the wrong guy.

618
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,485
Oliver Queen isn't the Arrow.

619
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,490
I am.

620
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,725
Behind your head!
