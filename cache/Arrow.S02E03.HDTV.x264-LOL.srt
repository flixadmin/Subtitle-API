1
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:03,185
My name
is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,058 --> 00:00:07,059
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,794
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:10,262 --> 00:00:12,896
to save my city.

5
00:00:12,898 --> 00:00:17,134
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:17,136 --> 00:00:19,937
To honor my friend's memory,

7
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:22,906
I must be someone else.

8
00:00:22,908 --> 00:00:26,493
I must be...something else.

9
00:00:27,797 --> 00:00:30,548
Previously on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:32,051 --> 00:00:36,421
Where the hell
did you come from?

11
00:00:36,423 --> 00:00:39,591
What do you think
you're doing, Officer Lance?

12
00:00:39,593 --> 00:00:42,093
This is my daughter.
She was nearly killed tonight.

13
00:00:42,095 --> 00:00:43,515
Well, as a parent,
you're welcome to stay.

14
00:00:43,516 --> 00:00:45,816
But as a beat cop, your more
than free to go.

15
00:00:45,818 --> 00:00:49,236
Let me help you.
Ok, you can help me.

16
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:50,988
To do what I do,
I need intel.

17
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,190
You can be my eyes
and ears in the Glades.

18
00:00:53,192 --> 00:00:55,909
That's how you
can save the city.

19
00:00:55,911 --> 00:00:57,695
How do I contact you?

20
00:00:57,697 --> 00:00:59,029
Leave that in
the alley wall,

21
00:00:59,031 --> 00:01:01,582
and I'll know
to contact you.

22
00:01:01,584 --> 00:01:03,367
I told you
to stay away from me.

23
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:04,918
The copycats are still alive.

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,620
Tommy Merlyn isn't.

25
00:01:06,622 --> 00:01:08,188
I lost a friend that day, too.

26
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,925
And I would gladly
have given my life for his.

27
00:01:11,927 --> 00:01:13,994
Well, don't worry,
your life is over.

28
00:01:13,996 --> 00:01:16,013
Your life
as a free man.

29
00:01:24,222 --> 00:01:25,556
Put your weapon down.

30
00:01:25,558 --> 00:01:29,176
I'm not your enemy.

31
00:01:29,178 --> 00:01:32,896
Then put
your weapon down.

32
00:01:55,804 --> 00:01:58,305
Don't move!

33
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,928
Nice mask.

34
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,231
Why'd you help me?

35
00:02:15,071 --> 00:02:19,071

Oh, thank God.

38
00:02:25,132 --> 00:02:27,215
Police scanner's been blowing up
for the past hour.

39
00:02:27,217 --> 00:02:29,601
Laurel called in half the force
with that silent alarm.

40
00:02:29,603 --> 00:02:31,970
Yeah, because going after
actual bad guys is so last year.

41
00:02:31,972 --> 00:02:34,589
To her, I am the bad guy.
Since when?

42
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:37,726
Since I didn't make it
to Tommy in time.

43
00:02:37,728 --> 00:02:39,644
How did you get out of there?

44
00:02:39,646 --> 00:02:42,781
I had help from a masked
blonde woman in black.

45
00:02:42,783 --> 00:02:44,866
Another copycat
vigilante?

46
00:02:44,868 --> 00:02:46,367
No. She was different.

47
00:02:46,369 --> 00:02:49,904
Trained, and she used
a sonic...thing.

48
00:02:49,906 --> 00:02:51,990
Wait, sonic thing?
Could you be a bit more specific?

49
00:02:51,992 --> 00:02:53,792
She turned it on
and the glass shattered.

50
00:02:53,794 --> 00:02:55,443
Ok, well, who was she
and why would she help you?

51
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:56,911
And how did she know
to help you?

52
00:02:56,913 --> 00:02:58,713
All good questions.

53
00:02:58,715 --> 00:02:59,798
I don't like the idea
of another player in town.

54
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,466
I'll see
what I can find.

55
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:03,301
Oliver, what I would
like to know is what

56
00:03:03,303 --> 00:03:04,552
you're doing at Laurel's office
in the first place.

57
00:03:04,554 --> 00:03:05,953
She makes you
public enemy number one

58
00:03:05,955 --> 00:03:07,789
and you figure this is
a good time to chat?

59
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,791
Because I thought
that I could talk to her

60
00:03:09,793 --> 00:03:12,093
and make her understand that
I'm doing things differently this time.

61
00:03:12,095 --> 00:03:14,145
That I'm not the bad guy.

62
00:03:14,147 --> 00:03:16,181
I was wrong.

63
00:03:16,183 --> 00:03:18,483
Wonderful.

64
00:03:18,485 --> 00:03:21,302
Now we have a dead Japanese
soldier in our home.

65
00:03:21,304 --> 00:03:24,022
Those men on the island were
looking for these corpses.

66
00:03:24,024 --> 00:03:25,824
Aren't you the least bit
interested in why?

67
00:03:25,826 --> 00:03:27,859
I'm more interested in how
many more there are of them

68
00:03:27,861 --> 00:03:29,861
and where
they're operating from.

69
00:03:29,863 --> 00:03:31,863
They'll be coming for that,
which means they'll be coming for us.

70
00:03:31,865 --> 00:03:34,866
And as we've already seen,
they're not the friendliest bunch.

71
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:36,868
So...

72
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,671
It kind of looks like
you've done that before.

73
00:03:39,673 --> 00:03:42,173
Back in Xingjian,
I was pre-med.

74
00:03:42,175 --> 00:03:44,342
She's a woman
of many talents.

75
00:03:44,344 --> 00:03:47,128
Come on.

76
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,347
"Come on" where?

77
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:51,833
To higher ground.
We need to get to a vantage point

78
00:03:51,835 --> 00:03:54,302
where we can establish
the enemy's position.

79
00:03:54,304 --> 00:03:57,472
What about Shado?

80
00:03:57,474 --> 00:04:00,341
I'll be fine here.

81
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:02,110
We shouldn't
split up.

82
00:04:02,112 --> 00:04:04,279
Let her play
with her corpse.

83
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:05,897
We'll be back
before she knows it.

84
00:04:13,906 --> 00:04:15,990
Here you go, Bud.

85
00:04:15,992 --> 00:04:17,575
On the house, Officer Lance.

86
00:04:17,577 --> 00:04:19,961
Hey, no, no, no, here you go,
a dog this delicious?

87
00:04:19,963 --> 00:04:22,029
I'd have to book myself
for robbery. Take it.

88
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:25,366
All right.
Take care.

89
00:04:25,368 --> 00:04:27,802
All units,
1078 at Second and Fletcher.

90
00:04:27,804 --> 00:04:29,587
Please respond.

91
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:32,557
Lance, patrol Delta Charlie 52,
10-60, officer responding.

92
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:34,876
Over.
Negative, DC-52.

93
00:04:34,878 --> 00:04:37,812
Disregard 10-78
and resume patrol.

94
00:04:37,814 --> 00:04:39,981
According
to whose orders?

95
00:04:39,983 --> 00:04:42,517
Lieutenant Pike.

96
00:04:48,691 --> 00:04:51,826
Excuse me.

97
00:04:51,828 --> 00:04:54,061
Bill, what is
going on here, huh?

98
00:04:54,063 --> 00:04:56,030
This is my beat.
Why did Pike wave me off of this?

99
00:04:56,032 --> 00:04:57,565
Quentin, it's under control.

100
00:04:57,567 --> 00:05:00,034
Excuse me,
what is under control?

101
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:05,123
That's Barton Mathis.

102
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,959
That seems to be
what the M.O. indicates.

103
00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:10,762
He's doing consecutive
life sentences in Iron Heights.

104
00:05:10,764 --> 00:05:12,413
Not anymore.

105
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:14,048
The quake split open
a section of Iron Heights.

106
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,865
Mathis was among the escapees.

107
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:19,201
The brass want to avoid
a panic, so they're keeping it quiet.

108
00:05:19,203 --> 00:05:20,771
Are they keeping it
quiet from me, too?

109
00:05:20,772 --> 00:05:21,938
Come on, man. Pike knows

110
00:05:21,963 --> 00:05:23,619
what happened to you last time.
The man got in your head.

111
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,588
Yeah, and I caught him.
And no one knows  Mathis better.

112
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,624
And I've got all your notes
and your files. Pike's order.

113
00:05:29,626 --> 00:05:31,636
If you go anywhere near this,

114
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:33,546
he's going to have you
arrested for obstruction.

115
00:05:49,595 --> 00:05:51,596
I found a number
of police reports

116
00:05:51,598 --> 00:05:53,764
from the last few months
that may involve our mystery girl.

117
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:58,069
They describe a masked woman
in black attacking attackers.

118
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:00,204
She put five would-be rapists
in the hospital so far.

119
00:06:00,206 --> 00:06:01,789
Are you sure
it's her?

120
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,708
Broken limbs, ruptured ear drums...
Your sonic thing.

121
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,127
That's her. She's
targeting criminals.

122
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:08,129
Misogynist criminals.

123
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:10,448
First the hoods, now her.
Looks like you started a movement.

124
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,151
I don't want to start a movement,
so we catch her.

125
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:15,336
I'm not letting the city get overrun
with vigilantes.

126
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:20,758
Hi, Detective.

127
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,723
So...

128
00:06:35,725 --> 00:06:39,243
Miss Smoak gives you
a way to call me now.

129
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:43,114
She vouches for you.

130
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:45,733
And you told me that you're trying
to help the city without dropping bodies.

131
00:06:45,735 --> 00:06:48,102
That true?

132
00:06:48,104 --> 00:06:51,039
What do you think?

133
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:54,876
Let's just say
I'm willing to be convinced.

134
00:06:54,878 --> 00:06:58,546
This city is hurting.

135
00:06:58,548 --> 00:07:00,264
And the police?

136
00:07:02,502 --> 00:07:04,218
I always thought
we didn't need to go

137
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,354
outside of law
to find justice.

138
00:07:06,356 --> 00:07:08,973
But in light
of recent events,

139
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:11,893
I'm not so sure anymore.

140
00:07:13,862 --> 00:07:16,514
Barton Mathis.

141
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:20,151
The media calls him
the Doll Maker.

142
00:07:20,153 --> 00:07:24,205
'Cause he suffocates
his victims with a flexible polymer

143
00:07:24,207 --> 00:07:27,959
that he pours down their throats
and then he dresses them up like dolls.

144
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:29,661
I put him away.

145
00:07:29,663 --> 00:07:31,879
Because of the quake...

146
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:35,583
He's out and he's killing again.

147
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:38,720
These are from
six years ago.

148
00:07:38,722 --> 00:07:40,722
That's my personal file.

149
00:07:40,724 --> 00:07:44,709
Maybe it's not just
the file that's personal.

150
00:07:44,711 --> 00:07:47,762
Mathis killed eight girls
before I got him last time.

151
00:07:47,764 --> 00:07:49,931
I don't want any more
on my conscience.

152
00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:55,820
So why don't you let
the police do their job?

153
00:07:55,822 --> 00:07:58,940
I could say
the same thing to you.

154
00:08:00,492 --> 00:08:02,827
They're spread so thin,
they can't even risk

155
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:05,229
letting the public know
that Mathis is out.

156
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:07,749
You said you're trying
another way?

157
00:08:07,751 --> 00:08:10,702
Maybe I am, too.

158
00:08:38,364 --> 00:08:41,349
You have such beautiful skin.

159
00:08:55,897 --> 00:08:58,232
Lance's file
give you anything?

160
00:08:58,234 --> 00:09:00,785
Last time the Doll Maker
was active in Starling City,

161
00:09:00,787 --> 00:09:03,070
he ramped up to one kill
every three days.

162
00:09:03,072 --> 00:09:04,905
That gives us
two to catch him.

163
00:09:04,907 --> 00:09:06,937
Can we connect the victims?

164
00:09:06,938 --> 00:09:09,071
Young. Pretty.

165
00:09:09,073 --> 00:09:10,388
According to Lance's file,

166
00:09:10,413 --> 00:09:12,014
he couldn't figure
out how he chose them.

167
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,161
As if porcelain dolls weren't
creepy enough

168
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:16,946
all on their own.

169
00:09:16,948 --> 00:09:19,115
Barton Mathis doesn't have
any family or known acquaintances.

170
00:09:19,117 --> 00:09:22,368
Lone wolves
are harder to catch.

171
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,204
But they do have the right
to an attorney.

172
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:27,340
Call Lance.

173
00:09:27,342 --> 00:09:28,758
Tell him to set up
a meeting for tonight.

174
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,209
Where?
At the office

175
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:32,578
of whoever represented
Barton Mathis.

176
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,747
So I'm assuming
this takes priority

177
00:09:34,749 --> 00:09:37,466
over finding out the identity of
your secret admirer.

178
00:09:37,468 --> 00:09:40,770
I got that covered.

179
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,145
Hey.

180
00:09:49,147 --> 00:09:51,447
I was wondering when I was going
to see you again.

181
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:54,116
There's someone new
in town--a woman.

182
00:09:54,118 --> 00:09:56,535
She's targeting men
who target women.

183
00:09:56,537 --> 00:09:59,655
I know.
I've seen her.

184
00:09:59,657 --> 00:10:02,625
Find her, but don't engage.

185
00:10:02,627 --> 00:10:05,244
Leave that to me.

186
00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:09,948
The archer
makes quite a mess.

187
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,501
I'll add that charge
to the indictment.

188
00:10:12,503 --> 00:10:14,804
Well, you called it
right. He showed.

189
00:10:14,806 --> 00:10:18,391
I know him pretty well.
At least better than others.

190
00:10:18,393 --> 00:10:19,842
This place is a mess.

191
00:10:19,844 --> 00:10:21,644
Twice in three weeks,
you're ducking bullets.

192
00:10:21,646 --> 00:10:23,062
I'm fine.
You don't look fine.

193
00:10:23,064 --> 00:10:24,630
You look tired.

194
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:27,650
I think I'll give
you two a moment.

195
00:10:27,652 --> 00:10:31,237
Did you just come here
to tell me how tired I look?

196
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:33,239
No, I came here
to check up on you

197
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:36,025
and check up
on some court records.

198
00:10:36,027 --> 00:10:40,362
Barton Mathis is out.
I'm looking for his attorney.

199
00:10:40,364 --> 00:10:42,648
Why? You're no longer
a detective.

200
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,284
Yeah, well, I'm just doing a little
digging off the books.

201
00:10:45,286 --> 00:10:47,837
Dad, this case...

202
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,489
It took you to such
a dark place last time.

203
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:55,511
Yeah, well, I think we both know
that it wasn't Mathis who did that.

204
00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:58,681
Look, nobody knows
this guy better than me,

205
00:10:58,683 --> 00:11:00,850
which means nobody's got a
better chance of stopping him, ok?

206
00:11:00,852 --> 00:11:03,803
And that means every girl that he kills
is like another one on my conscience.

207
00:11:03,805 --> 00:11:05,604
No.

208
00:11:05,606 --> 00:11:08,524
No, dad, it's not.

209
00:11:08,526 --> 00:11:11,844
Whatever guilt
you're feeling...

210
00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:15,448
You're just using it
to justify a vendetta.

211
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,067
Well, maybe I'm not
the only one.

212
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:31,747
Are you ok?

213
00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:34,383
Oh, Thea, you have to stop asking me
that every time you come to visit.

214
00:11:34,385 --> 00:11:36,085
Ah, don't count on it.

215
00:11:36,087 --> 00:11:38,036
Well, then, I'm afraid
you'll be asking me that

216
00:11:38,038 --> 00:11:40,055
for the next
25 years to life.

217
00:11:40,057 --> 00:11:42,174
Please don't talk like that.

218
00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:45,227
Thea, there's not a lot of value
in the power of positive thinking

219
00:11:45,229 --> 00:11:47,713
when you're being put on
trial for mass murder.

220
00:11:47,715 --> 00:11:52,401
Let's just try to take things
one step at a time, ok?

221
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:54,820
Well, I'd have to check
with my lawyer,

222
00:11:54,822 --> 00:11:56,572
but I don't think
retail therapy

223
00:11:56,574 --> 00:11:58,357
is a viable legal strategy.

224
00:11:58,359 --> 00:12:00,442
Well, I spoke with her,

225
00:12:00,444 --> 00:12:01,267
and she said that you can

226
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:03,322
wear regular clothes
to your pre-trial hearing.

227
00:12:03,998 --> 00:12:06,248
So I picked these.

228
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,334
Hmm.

229
00:12:08,336 --> 00:12:12,505
I wish the fashion police
was all I had to worry about.

230
00:12:12,507 --> 00:12:15,624
Please don't joke.
Thea, listen to me.

231
00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:19,211
I need you to understand
what's happening here.

232
00:12:19,213 --> 00:12:21,181
503 people are dead

233
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:23,519
and there is a measure
of guilt that is owed me.

234
00:12:25,253 --> 00:12:27,720
I'm ready to accept
my punishment.

235
00:12:28,222 --> 00:12:31,640
Even if that means spending
the rest of your life in here?

236
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,528
Yes.

237
00:12:45,989 --> 00:12:48,324
Tony Daniel?

238
00:12:48,326 --> 00:12:50,543
Help you with
something, Officer?

239
00:12:50,545 --> 00:12:53,412
Barton Mathis.
According to the D.A.'s office,

240
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:56,131
you handled his post-trial appeals,
and I'd like to know where he is.

241
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:59,101
So you can give him
a parking ticket or something?

242
00:12:59,103 --> 00:13:02,805
If you want to talk to me
about one of my clients,

243
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:05,758
come back
with a detective shield.

244
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,760
Or a court order.

245
00:13:07,762 --> 00:13:10,396
What, you find that funny?

246
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:13,148
Well, a little bit.

247
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,487
Where do we
find him?

248
00:13:18,489 --> 00:13:20,055
Iron Heights prison.

249
00:13:20,057 --> 00:13:22,157
He got out.
What?

250
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,409
How?

251
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:25,110
You spent hours
with him!

252
00:13:25,112 --> 00:13:27,580
Where would he run?
Where?!

253
00:13:27,582 --> 00:13:29,365
I don't know, I--I swear!

254
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:35,504
What the hell are you doing?!
I thought you were done killing people!

255
00:13:35,506 --> 00:13:37,006
He'll live.

256
00:13:37,008 --> 00:13:38,674
Yeah, but he'll report me
to my lieutenant!

257
00:13:38,676 --> 00:13:40,259
He won't talk
to anyone.

258
00:13:40,261 --> 00:13:41,427
What makes you so sure?

259
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:43,212
Because he has
another shoulder.

260
00:13:43,214 --> 00:13:46,048
Aah! Oh, ok, ok, ok!

261
00:13:48,386 --> 00:13:51,136
There--there is another place.

262
00:13:51,138 --> 00:13:53,055
He was always drawing it.

263
00:13:53,057 --> 00:13:54,390
Sketching.

264
00:13:54,392 --> 00:13:56,141
His cell walls were covered
with the place.

265
00:13:56,143 --> 00:13:58,143
Yeah, well, what's the place?
Was it in Starling City?

266
00:13:58,145 --> 00:13:59,528
Yeah.

267
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,864
The Bisque Museum.

268
00:14:01,866 --> 00:14:04,400
He said the building
reminded him of Germany.

269
00:14:04,402 --> 00:14:06,986
Where porcelain dolls
were invented.

270
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,043
I'm sorry. I guess he just gets
enthusiastic sometimes.

271
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:24,553
The lady at the desk said a guy
matching Mathis' description

272
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:27,006
checked in last week,
room 52.

273
00:14:27,008 --> 00:14:29,475
And he paid in cash.

274
00:14:31,144 --> 00:14:33,228
Now listen,
just we're so clear,

275
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,047
when we go through that door,
we're here to arrest Mathis, ok,

276
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:37,599
not to torture him.
You asked for my help.

277
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:39,551
Yeah, and that wasn't either,
and neither is aiding and abetting.

278
00:14:39,553 --> 00:14:41,904
And I am still
a police officer.

279
00:14:41,906 --> 00:14:44,106
Do you want
to catch him or not?

280
00:14:45,776 --> 00:14:48,277
Let's go.

281
00:15:07,213 --> 00:15:09,598
Detective.

282
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,517
It's been too long.

283
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,635
Felicity,
I need a trace.

284
00:15:13,637 --> 00:15:15,804
On it.

285
00:15:15,806 --> 00:15:18,057
You sick son of a bitch.

286
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:20,442
Sick? I've never felt better.

287
00:15:20,444 --> 00:15:22,361
Fresh air agrees with me.

288
00:15:22,363 --> 00:15:24,396
Yeah, well, don't
get too used to it.

289
00:15:24,398 --> 00:15:25,246
I caught you before.

290
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:27,513
It's just a matter of time
before I do it again.

291
00:15:28,035 --> 00:15:30,452
Fair enough.
In the meantime, however,

292
00:15:30,454 --> 00:15:33,122
I have someone who'd like
to say hello to you.

293
00:15:33,124 --> 00:15:34,940
Say hello, dear.

294
00:15:39,746 --> 00:15:42,047
She's a little inarticulate.

295
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:43,966
She's done nothing to you.

296
00:15:43,968 --> 00:15:46,051
Please, don't hurt her,
just let her go.

297
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:47,669
And allow her to wither away

298
00:15:47,671 --> 00:15:49,722
in a mediocre
and forgettable life.

299
00:15:49,724 --> 00:15:51,974
No. No, no, no, no, no.

300
00:15:51,976 --> 00:15:55,293
She deserves so much better.

301
00:15:55,295 --> 00:15:58,981
She deserves to see
her beauty preserved.

302
00:15:58,983 --> 00:16:01,850
Pristine.

303
00:16:01,852 --> 00:16:03,936
Forever.

304
00:16:03,938 --> 00:16:05,470
Don't worry.

305
00:16:05,472 --> 00:16:08,690
I will turn her into
something special.

306
00:16:08,692 --> 00:16:10,826
Pay attention,
Detective.

307
00:16:10,828 --> 00:16:13,946
What comes next
is really quite exquisite.

308
00:16:13,948 --> 00:16:18,000
The sound of an esophagus
slowly hardening.

309
00:16:20,621 --> 00:16:22,621
Like a symphony.

310
00:16:23,924 --> 00:16:25,507
Felicity...

311
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:27,342
We're trying, but he's
blocked the skip trace.

312
00:16:27,344 --> 00:16:29,327
Barton, don't do it.
I'm begging you, ok?

313
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:31,847
Is that what you want?
I am begging you. Please, just stop!

314
00:16:33,349 --> 00:16:36,435
It's for the world to enjoy.

315
00:16:36,437 --> 00:16:39,021
After all...

316
00:16:40,273 --> 00:16:43,609
Everyone loves
a pretty doll.

317
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:12,247
The police
found her body an hour ago.

318
00:17:12,249 --> 00:17:14,466
Does the new victim
give us any forensics we can use?

319
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:16,367
CSI did a complete
forensics work-up,

320
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,803
but they sent everything out
to a private lab.

321
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,588
Can you get in?

322
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:23,174
No. They took
their system offline.

323
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:24,692
It seems like someone hacked

324
00:17:24,717 --> 00:17:26,813
into a lot of police-related
systems last year.

325
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:30,682
Then we do it like
we did the Merlyn job.

326
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,660
So glad you invited me
to tag along.

327
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:46,264
Tranq dart. He'll be
out for 36 minutes.

328
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,667
Yeah, I remember.

329
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,253
You're up, Felicity.

330
00:17:52,255 --> 00:17:54,255
So, this is what a typical
night's like for you, huh?

331
00:17:54,257 --> 00:17:56,124
Just a little breaking
and entering.

332
00:17:56,126 --> 00:17:59,794
All right, I got
toxicology first.

333
00:18:01,764 --> 00:18:03,431
What are all these?

334
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:05,850
Chemical ingredients of all
the make-up found on the victims--

335
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:07,635
skin cream,
nail polish, lipstick.

336
00:18:07,637 --> 00:18:10,021
Wait, wait,
wait, stop.

337
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:11,923
Scroll back.
Scroll back.

338
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:16,144
This one. Ethyl paraben.
Sodium laureth sulphate.

339
00:18:16,146 --> 00:18:18,730
I've seen this before.

340
00:18:18,732 --> 00:18:20,448
It's skin cream.

341
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,283
Forensics found traces
of it on her fingers.

342
00:18:22,285 --> 00:18:24,319
Probably something
she used before he grabbed her.

343
00:18:24,321 --> 00:18:25,987
Skin cream.

344
00:18:25,989 --> 00:18:28,073
Mermaid something.
One of the victims from his last run,

345
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:29,958
she had this in her purse and
I had the lab analyze it,

346
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,544
and it's the same formula.

347
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:34,579
Felicity...
Already on it.

348
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:39,834
How the hell
could she do that?

349
00:18:39,836 --> 00:18:42,721
Ethyl paraben
and sodium laureth sulphate

350
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:44,973
is Mermaiden's
proprietary formula.

351
00:18:44,975 --> 00:18:46,891
Two victims with the same taste
in skin cream.

352
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:48,676
That can't be a coincidence.

353
00:18:48,678 --> 00:18:51,346
I could never figure out how
he chose his victims.

354
00:18:51,348 --> 00:18:53,398
I think you just did.

355
00:18:55,484 --> 00:18:58,236
We shouldn't have left Shado.

356
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:02,323
Well, it's her life.
It's her choice.

357
00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:04,159
You listen
to my advice.

358
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:06,578
What advice?
To avoid attachment.

359
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,830
Yeah. That was bad advice.

360
00:19:08,832 --> 00:19:10,331
But it will
save your life.

361
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,534
Maybe I don't want
to live under those terms.

362
00:19:12,536 --> 00:19:14,202
Yeah, well, maybe
you're an idiot.

363
00:19:14,204 --> 00:19:16,988
Hey, you think that carrying
about people gets you killed.

364
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,257
I think it's what
keeps people alive.

365
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:22,210
I was wrong about you.

366
00:19:22,212 --> 00:19:25,096
You're definitely
an idiot.

367
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:27,682
Then that's who I am.

368
00:19:27,684 --> 00:19:30,802
I'm not changing.
Ohh!

369
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,731
You should be happy I haven't
avoided attachment to you.

370
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,406
Harper.

371
00:19:51,408 --> 00:19:53,575
It's been a while, hoss.

372
00:19:53,577 --> 00:19:54,993
I've been busy.

373
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:56,744
I can see that.

374
00:19:56,746 --> 00:19:58,079
I'll give you a hundred.

375
00:19:58,081 --> 00:20:00,965
Four.
Two-five.

376
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,967
Done.

377
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:05,336
If you throw in
some information.

378
00:20:07,057 --> 00:20:09,007
Come on, man, you've got
your finger on the pulse.

379
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:10,258
I'm looking for someone.

380
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,393
A blonde, likes black leather.

381
00:20:12,395 --> 00:20:13,978
Sounds like your type.

382
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,264
And beats the crap
out of guys with a bow staff.

383
00:20:16,266 --> 00:20:18,066
That still sounds
like your type.

384
00:20:18,068 --> 00:20:20,485
But I want to put eyes on her.
What do you know?

385
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:22,237
Not much.

386
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:23,438
You know Cindy?

387
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,657
Folks call her "Sin."

388
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:27,909
She's got short,
spiky hair.

389
00:20:27,911 --> 00:20:29,611
Yeah, I've seen her
a couple times

390
00:20:29,613 --> 00:20:32,447
hanging around with your black
leather girlfriend.

391
00:20:32,449 --> 00:20:33,948
So where can I find sin?

392
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,901
Well, she hangs out
over at Fifth and Boyton.

393
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:40,588
And that
is what I know.

394
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:47,045
So this is it.

395
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:48,880
Skin cream, that's our lead?

396
00:20:48,882 --> 00:20:50,665
It's something.

397
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,750
What do we know
about the product?

398
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,470
It's made from crushed mother of pearl
and it's super high-end.

399
00:20:55,472 --> 00:20:57,555
Only carried
in a handful of boutiques

400
00:20:57,557 --> 00:21:00,024
and it's marketed for women
with extremely delicate complexions.

401
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:02,360
He picks his victims
for their skin.

402
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:04,863
The cream is how
he finds them.

403
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:06,514
Only four stores
in the city carry it

404
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:08,783
and three have
surveillance systems.

405
00:21:08,785 --> 00:21:10,401
I've ran facial recognition
through all of them looking for Mathis,

406
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:12,036
but come up empty.

407
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:13,705
He must be staking out
the stores from the outside.

408
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:15,156
Fine. So we'll
do the same.

409
00:21:15,158 --> 00:21:17,508
That could take days
we don't have.

410
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,327
He's probably out there
right now looking for another girl.

411
00:21:19,329 --> 00:21:20,962
So that's what
we give him.

412
00:21:20,964 --> 00:21:23,715
I'll go to the stores
that carry Mermaiden,

413
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:25,466
and buy it in each one
to cover our bases.

414
00:21:25,468 --> 00:21:27,118
It's too dangerous.

415
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,754
More dangerous than going
undercover in a mob casino

416
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:31,923
or jumping out of a plane?

417
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:33,591
It's my life.

418
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:35,643
It's my choice.

419
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,765
There are only two ways
onto this island--

420
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:43,685
by sea, and by air.

421
00:21:43,687 --> 00:21:46,241
So what, you're going

422
00:21:46,266 --> 00:21:48,226
to steal whatever they use
to get onto the island?

423
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:52,694
Well, I'm tired
of living here, aren't you?

424
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,336
Oh, my God.

425
00:22:01,338 --> 00:22:04,255
It appears to be
two or three clicks offshore.

426
00:22:05,926 --> 00:22:07,842
What the hell?

427
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,132
It's firing off
its location.

428
00:22:14,134 --> 00:22:16,000
The plane!

429
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,269
They must have found it.
Shado!

430
00:22:18,271 --> 00:22:21,022
Kid!

431
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,510
Left the last store.

432
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,896
You're going to reimburse me
for these, right?

433
00:22:28,898 --> 00:22:30,949
I saved my receipts.

434
00:22:30,951 --> 00:22:34,902
Go to
the rendezvous point.

435
00:22:34,904 --> 00:22:37,572
Stay in public.

436
00:22:40,242 --> 00:22:42,994
Just for the record,
I'm not a huge fan

437
00:22:42,996 --> 00:22:46,080
of dangling helpless girls
in front of psychopaths like meat.

438
00:22:46,082 --> 00:22:47,799
She volunteered.

439
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:50,001
Well, she must really
believe in you.

440
00:22:50,003 --> 00:22:52,503
So did your daughter.

441
00:22:54,724 --> 00:22:57,425
She suffered a loss.

442
00:22:57,427 --> 00:23:00,544
Grief's got a way of shifting
a person's beliefs.

443
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,847
But then you know
all about that.

444
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,983
You've lost people, too, right?

445
00:23:04,985 --> 00:23:07,902
Why would you say that?

446
00:23:07,904 --> 00:23:10,605
Why else would you be
doing this?

447
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:13,741
My youngest, she died.

448
00:23:13,743 --> 00:23:16,461
I'm sorry.

449
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:19,063
Less than a month
after it happened,

450
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:23,751
I--I ended up catching
the Doll Maker case.

451
00:23:23,753 --> 00:23:25,586
Threw myself into it.

452
00:23:25,588 --> 00:23:30,174
I think on some level,
with each girl I was trying to save...

453
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:32,410
Sara.

454
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:34,796
And just like with Sara,
I couldn't.

455
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,353
He killed eight girls
Sara's age before I caught him.

456
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:46,057
Someone's coming.

457
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,594
I got him.

458
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:56,284
Ok, I'm going to admit to being
seriously wigged out right now.

459
00:23:56,286 --> 00:23:59,987
False alarm, but next time
I offer to be bait for your serial killer,

460
00:23:59,989 --> 00:24:02,373
please turn me down.

461
00:24:05,462 --> 00:24:08,880
Delta Charlie 52
to Central.

462
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:11,082
Code 99, possible 207
in progress,

463
00:24:11,084 --> 00:24:14,335
immediate back-up required!

464
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:25,480
You're all right, you're all right.
Don't move.

465
00:24:26,849 --> 00:24:28,483
She hit her head.

466
00:24:28,485 --> 00:24:29,901
Go, go, go.

467
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:48,503
I thought there'd be more
ceremony to this moment.

468
00:24:48,505 --> 00:24:51,038
I'm a little disappointed,
to be honest.

469
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,713
Get out of here!

470
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:04,168
Officer Lance, SCPD.

471
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,053
It's Mathis.
I almost had him.

472
00:25:06,055 --> 00:25:08,523
Search the area.
Whole building.

473
00:25:08,525 --> 00:25:10,674
Sorry.
For what?

474
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,194
Pike's orders. He wants you collared
for obstruction.

475
00:25:13,196 --> 00:25:15,396
What, he--

476
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:19,700
Quentin Larry Lance,
you have the right to remain silent.

477
00:25:19,702 --> 00:25:22,770
If you give up that right to remain silent,
anything you say can...

478
00:25:28,676 --> 00:25:30,716
They're charging
Lance with obstruction.

479
00:25:30,757 --> 00:25:32,991
He's in custody.
Mathis isn't.

480
00:25:32,993 --> 00:25:34,676
He'll be looking
for another target.

481
00:25:34,678 --> 00:25:36,378
I hacked Mermaiden
and sent out an email blast

482
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,763
from their servers telling stores
the product was defective.

483
00:25:38,765 --> 00:25:41,016
That will slow them down.
Smart.

484
00:25:41,018 --> 00:25:42,434
What about Lance?

485
00:25:42,436 --> 00:25:44,436
One legal problem
at a time.

486
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:53,011
Docket ending 4587,
State versus Queen.

487
00:25:53,013 --> 00:25:57,649
All right, I'll hear your motions,
ladies first.

488
00:25:57,651 --> 00:26:00,035
Your Honor, we would like to be
heard once again

489
00:26:00,037 --> 00:26:01,569
on the issue of bail.

490
00:26:01,571 --> 00:26:04,089
Ms. Queen has languished
in the Iron Heights prison

491
00:26:04,091 --> 00:26:05,690
now for five months.
And in those five months,

492
00:26:05,692 --> 00:26:08,576
did the 503 people
she's charged with killing

493
00:26:08,578 --> 00:26:10,361
miraculously return
from the dead?

494
00:26:10,363 --> 00:26:11,663
If not, I'm a little unclear

495
00:26:11,665 --> 00:26:13,181
on how the passage
of time is relevant.

496
00:26:13,183 --> 00:26:15,050
Might I remind the court
that the defendant

497
00:26:15,052 --> 00:26:16,651
is presumed innocent?

498
00:26:16,653 --> 00:26:18,520
No need.
I want to law school.

499
00:26:18,522 --> 00:26:19,888
It's where
I learned that bail,

500
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,090
once denied, cannot be set
in the absence

501
00:26:22,092 --> 00:26:24,375
of change of circumstance.
Mr. Donner,

502
00:26:24,377 --> 00:26:26,061
what do you have for me?

503
00:26:26,063 --> 00:26:28,713
Your Honor, the State
has no pre-trial motions

504
00:26:28,715 --> 00:26:30,682
to make at this time.

505
00:26:30,684 --> 00:26:33,601
But we would like
to serve notice to the defense

506
00:26:33,603 --> 00:26:36,855
pursuant to rule of
criminal procedure 15.

507
00:26:36,857 --> 00:26:39,774
Your Honor, I would like
to conference with the district attorney.

508
00:26:39,776 --> 00:26:42,444
There's really no need,
nor any obligation.

509
00:26:42,446 --> 00:26:44,279
What about
professional courtesy?

510
00:26:44,281 --> 00:26:45,730
I would like to have
a conversation with you

511
00:26:45,732 --> 00:26:48,232
before you seek
the death penalty.

512
00:26:52,922 --> 00:26:57,241
Your client aided and abetted
an act of mass murder.

513
00:26:57,243 --> 00:27:00,078
503 conversations
wouldn't convince me

514
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,932
that Moira Queen
shouldn't be the 504th fatality.

515
00:27:03,934 --> 00:27:06,384
Mom, we are going
to fight this.

516
00:27:06,386 --> 00:27:09,688
No one is going
to take you from us.

517
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:12,440
We won't let it happen.

518
00:27:12,442 --> 00:27:15,777
Oliver!

519
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:28,606
Oliver!

520
00:27:29,793 --> 00:27:31,459
Shado!

521
00:28:03,744 --> 00:28:06,828
I had to call in
a lot of favors to get those.

522
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,997
The only problem is that I've been
at the D.A.'s office

523
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:12,984
for less than a month,
and no one owes me any favors.

524
00:28:12,986 --> 00:28:15,503
So how did you get
the charges dropped?

525
00:28:15,505 --> 00:28:17,239
Your friend Pike and
I have been working together

526
00:28:17,264 --> 00:28:18,323
on the anti-vigilante taskforce.

527
00:28:18,324 --> 00:28:19,874
Do you remember?

528
00:28:19,876 --> 00:28:21,676
Hmm. Last year you were
working with the Arrow.

529
00:28:21,678 --> 00:28:23,344
What a difference
a few months makes.

530
00:28:23,346 --> 00:28:24,679
The Arrow?

531
00:28:24,681 --> 00:28:27,265
Yeah. Seems more
appropriate than the Hood.

532
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:29,017
And now you're working with him.

533
00:28:29,019 --> 00:28:31,603
Guess I'm not the only one
in the Lance family that's done a 180.

534
00:28:31,605 --> 00:28:33,671
This city needs help.
I just became less particular

535
00:28:33,673 --> 00:28:36,357
about where it
comes from.

536
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:38,359
What's your excuse?

537
00:28:38,361 --> 00:28:40,061
Still Tommy?

538
00:28:40,063 --> 00:28:43,615
What would you tell me
if I said it is?

539
00:28:45,518 --> 00:28:47,652
That a guy with a bow and arrow
can't save a guy

540
00:28:47,654 --> 00:28:50,188
whose had a building
fall on top of him.

541
00:28:51,791 --> 00:28:54,459
What's going on with you
is not about the Arrow.

542
00:28:54,461 --> 00:28:58,129
Then what is it, Dad? Hmm?

543
00:28:58,131 --> 00:29:00,348
I mean, why don't you tell me?

544
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,383
You seem to have
all the answers.

545
00:29:02,385 --> 00:29:04,803
That crack that you made about me
feeling guilty about something.

546
00:29:04,805 --> 00:29:07,505
Tommy's death.

547
00:29:07,507 --> 00:29:10,558
Why would I feel guilty
about that?

548
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,093
I don't know.
I wish I did.

549
00:29:12,095 --> 00:29:13,878
'Cause it's
eating you up.

550
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,563
Your psychoanalysis

551
00:29:15,565 --> 00:29:17,182
would probably have
a bit more credibility

552
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,101
if it wasn't being offered
under police custody.

553
00:29:21,237 --> 00:29:23,855
Laurel, I'm worried
about you--

554
00:29:23,857 --> 00:29:25,156
I'd stay away from Pike
if I were you,

555
00:29:25,158 --> 00:29:26,941
and the Doll Maker case.

556
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:45,793
Excuse me.

557
00:29:45,795 --> 00:29:49,264
Step off,
Abercrombie.

558
00:29:49,266 --> 00:29:51,850
Cindy?

559
00:29:51,852 --> 00:29:53,268
Sin?

560
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:56,387
What do you want?
Can't you see I'm busy?

561
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:58,589
I'm looking
for a friend of yours.

562
00:29:58,591 --> 00:30:01,592
Blonde.
Black leather, head to toe.

563
00:30:04,763 --> 00:30:07,282
So I guess
that's a yes.

564
00:31:11,131 --> 00:31:14,465
He said he would
go inside...

565
00:31:14,467 --> 00:31:18,169
That's what he said.
He said he would go inside.

566
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:20,004
You all right, pal?

567
00:31:20,006 --> 00:31:23,942
Need a doctor
or something?

568
00:31:23,944 --> 00:31:25,693
No.

569
00:31:25,695 --> 00:31:27,895
I'm fine, thanks.

570
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,631
I checked the order
and you shorted us

571
00:31:45,632 --> 00:31:47,415
half a case
of champagne.

572
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:50,552
I'm not paying for
booze I didn't get.

573
00:31:57,476 --> 00:32:00,228
That won't help.

574
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:04,265
Yeah, well, neither
is yelling at my vendors, but...

575
00:32:04,267 --> 00:32:06,150
I want to yell at
someone right now.

576
00:32:06,152 --> 00:32:07,819
Mom's going to be ok.

577
00:32:07,821 --> 00:32:10,889
Because we are going
to help her fight this.

578
00:32:10,891 --> 00:32:12,357
As a family.

579
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:14,409
They want
to kill her.

580
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:16,644
I won't let them.

581
00:32:19,832 --> 00:32:23,651
Thea, can you turn
to channel 52, please?

582
00:32:25,254 --> 00:32:28,506
Officer Quentin Lance
and his daughter Laurel

583
00:32:28,508 --> 00:32:30,542
were abducted earlier today.

584
00:32:30,544 --> 00:32:32,794
No ransom has been demanded.

585
00:32:32,796 --> 00:32:36,531
SCPD are urging anyone with information
regarding their whereabouts...

586
00:32:36,533 --> 00:32:38,049
How did he get them?

587
00:32:38,051 --> 00:32:39,968
I don't know
about Laurel.

588
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,769
Detective Lance was abducted from
the precinct parking lot.

589
00:32:41,771 --> 00:32:43,538
Mathis shot a guard on the way out,
which sounded the alarm.

590
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,007
I pulled up the department's
security camera footage,

591
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:48,175
and a van from Metamorpho
Chemical caught my eye.

592
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:50,194
Metamorpho was condemned
after the quake.

593
00:32:50,196 --> 00:32:52,046
Perfect place
to make some dolls.

594
00:32:52,048 --> 00:32:53,531
Not tonight.

595
00:32:53,533 --> 00:32:54,899
Cops will use tracers,
Oliver, same as we did.

596
00:32:54,901 --> 00:32:56,684
They won't make it in time.

597
00:32:58,737 --> 00:33:00,321
Hey.

598
00:33:00,323 --> 00:33:03,708
- Wake up, Abercrombie.
- What?

599
00:33:09,965 --> 00:33:12,533
Did they send you?

600
00:33:12,535 --> 00:33:14,752
Did who what?

601
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:23,044
Not my face!

602
00:33:23,046 --> 00:33:26,931
I have a disapproving
girlfriend.

603
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:28,650
Are you one of them?

604
00:33:28,652 --> 00:33:30,568
One of who?

605
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:35,773
That's mine.

606
00:33:37,576 --> 00:33:39,744
Let him go.

607
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:55,793
Isn't this nice?

608
00:33:55,795 --> 00:33:57,795
All of us here together.

609
00:33:57,797 --> 00:33:59,380
It's like Thanksgiving.

610
00:33:59,382 --> 00:34:02,083
Laurel, just stay calm.
Stay calm.

611
00:34:02,085 --> 00:34:04,969
Barton, I'm sorry.
I know you hate me.

612
00:34:04,971 --> 00:34:06,888
I know you hate me, ok,
and I understand that.

613
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:11,109
But you hate me.
So please let my daughter go.

614
00:34:11,111 --> 00:34:14,445
Now why would I do that?

615
00:34:14,447 --> 00:34:16,430
Look at her.

616
00:34:16,432 --> 00:34:18,783
She's so lovely.

617
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:24,372
Maybe a little too much melanin
in the skin,

618
00:34:24,374 --> 00:34:28,109
but...it's the imperfections
that make art sublime.

619
00:34:28,111 --> 00:34:31,329
I am the one who put you away.
She had nothing to do with it!

620
00:34:31,331 --> 00:34:33,614
She had everything
to do with it!

621
00:34:33,616 --> 00:34:35,133
She's your world,
she's your very soul.

622
00:34:35,135 --> 00:34:36,951
You know,
I could kill you,

623
00:34:36,953 --> 00:34:39,921
I could maim you, I could slice you up
into a thousand pieces,

624
00:34:39,923 --> 00:34:41,455
but if your soul
remains intact,

625
00:34:41,457 --> 00:34:44,625
what have I done? Huh?

626
00:34:44,627 --> 00:34:46,293
Nothing.

627
00:34:46,295 --> 00:34:48,796
I will kill you, you son of a bitch!
I will kill you!

628
00:34:48,798 --> 00:34:50,965
You son of a bitch!

629
00:34:57,656 --> 00:34:59,824
Laurel...Sweetheart...

630
00:34:59,826 --> 00:35:01,976
Close your eyes.

631
00:35:01,978 --> 00:35:04,696
I'm here.

632
00:35:04,698 --> 00:35:07,615
I'm here, honey.

633
00:35:07,617 --> 00:35:11,002
If you struggle,
it will take longer.

634
00:35:20,462 --> 00:35:24,498
Do whatever you need to do,
just get him. Get him!

635
00:35:55,664 --> 00:35:58,027
Let's take a better look
at this face of yours.

636
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,215
You have such lovely skin.

637
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:07,258
You're going back to prison.

638
00:36:08,727 --> 00:36:12,430
No, he's not.

639
00:36:13,482 --> 00:36:15,600
It's ok, sweetheart.

640
00:36:15,602 --> 00:36:17,985
It's ok,
he saved us.

641
00:36:17,987 --> 00:36:19,937
I know.

642
00:36:19,939 --> 00:36:23,224
I know he did,
and after I hunted him.

643
00:36:23,226 --> 00:36:24,992
It's ok,
it's all right.

644
00:36:24,994 --> 00:36:26,894
No. He came.

645
00:36:26,896 --> 00:36:29,113
He came to save me.

646
00:36:29,115 --> 00:36:30,948
Yeah, I know,
he saved us both.

647
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,733
No.

648
00:36:32,735 --> 00:36:35,086
Not him.

649
00:36:35,088 --> 00:36:37,738
Not the Arrow.

650
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,841
Tommy.

651
00:36:39,843 --> 00:36:41,092
What?

652
00:36:41,094 --> 00:36:42,593
Oliver, he--

653
00:36:42,595 --> 00:36:44,545
he told me to stay
out of the Glades,

654
00:36:44,547 --> 00:36:47,882
and he--he told me
to get out of CNRI,

655
00:36:47,884 --> 00:36:51,919
and I didn't.
Tommy was only there

656
00:36:51,921 --> 00:36:53,604
because I was too stubborn!

657
00:36:53,606 --> 00:36:56,307
To stubborn to get out
when I had the chance.

658
00:36:56,309 --> 00:36:58,476
You were right.

659
00:36:58,478 --> 00:37:01,362
I was blaming
the Arrow because...

660
00:37:01,364 --> 00:37:03,931
Oh, my God.

661
00:37:03,933 --> 00:37:06,767
It's all my fault, Dad.

662
00:37:06,769 --> 00:37:10,955
It's all my fault
that Tommy died.

663
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:18,496
It's all right, honey.

664
00:37:53,866 --> 00:37:55,685
How is she?

665
00:37:55,686 --> 00:37:57,686
She'll be all right.

666
00:37:57,688 --> 00:37:59,554
In time.

667
00:37:59,556 --> 00:38:02,107
I might not always agree
with your methods,

668
00:38:02,109 --> 00:38:04,743
but I can't argue
with your results.

669
00:38:04,745 --> 00:38:07,913
You saved my daughter.

670
00:38:07,915 --> 00:38:10,098
Again.

671
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,768
She needed help.

672
00:38:14,404 --> 00:38:17,372
And she wasn't the only one.

673
00:38:20,277 --> 00:38:22,327
Thanks.

674
00:38:26,617 --> 00:38:29,567
Moira.

675
00:38:29,569 --> 00:38:32,343
I know how hard
this day has been for you.

676
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:33,257
Yes.

677
00:38:33,258 --> 00:38:34,724
And believe it
or not,

678
00:38:34,726 --> 00:38:36,726
I've actually been
in worse situations.

679
00:38:36,728 --> 00:38:40,363
Listen to me. Donner knows
how strong our defense is.

680
00:38:40,365 --> 00:38:43,433
Don't let him scare you with that
little death penalty stunt of his.

681
00:38:43,435 --> 00:38:45,435
Oh, I'm not afraid
of dying, Jean.

682
00:38:45,437 --> 00:38:49,406
I've made my peace
with this world a long time ago.

683
00:38:49,408 --> 00:38:51,291
Then it's win the case
in the courtroom.

684
00:38:51,293 --> 00:38:53,393
The trial is going to reveal
that you were living

685
00:38:53,395 --> 00:38:55,795
under Malcolm Merlyn's thumb.
It's going to reveal everything.

686
00:38:55,797 --> 00:38:57,164
Yes.

687
00:38:57,166 --> 00:39:01,501
And that's what
I'm afraid of.

688
00:39:01,503 --> 00:39:04,638
Moira, what don't I know?

689
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,339
Don't you do this.

690
00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:08,008
You need to tell me.
I am your lawyer,

691
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:10,060
and I am also your friend.

692
00:39:10,062 --> 00:39:11,628
Thea and Oliver.

693
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,464
I'm finally in a good place with
my children, Jean.

694
00:39:14,466 --> 00:39:18,652
I have my family back.

695
00:39:18,654 --> 00:39:22,956
But there are
some things...

696
00:39:24,141 --> 00:39:27,646
that must never
be spoken of.

697
00:39:48,248 --> 00:39:50,333
You shouldn't
have come here.

698
00:39:51,785 --> 00:39:54,120
I had no choice.

699
00:39:54,122 --> 00:39:57,640
Ra's Al ghul
has ordered your return.

700
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,149
I'm not going back.
I can't.

701
00:40:06,816 --> 00:40:10,150
That is not your decision.

702
00:40:10,152 --> 00:40:13,987
Tell them that you
couldn't find me.

703
00:40:13,989 --> 00:40:16,573
Tell them I ran.

704
00:40:19,244 --> 00:40:22,363
I won't lie for you.

705
00:40:22,365 --> 00:40:24,915
Fine.

706
00:40:27,001 --> 00:40:30,204
Don't tell them
anything.

707
00:40:34,126 --> 00:40:35,659
Something's going on
with this woman.

708
00:40:35,661 --> 00:40:37,661
She keeps following you
around, helping you out.

709
00:40:37,663 --> 00:40:39,213
We've got to find her.
To stop her,

710
00:40:39,215 --> 00:40:40,681
or to send her
a thank you note?

711
00:40:40,683 --> 00:40:42,683
That depends.
On what?

712
00:40:42,685 --> 00:40:45,353
What side she's on.

713
