1
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,900
Tomorrow marks
the one year anniversary

2
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,800
since Velez Air Flight 180
exploded and crashed

3
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,100
shortly after takeoff
from JFK Airport.

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,300
It's a disaster
that's affected many.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,100
None more so than
Mt Abraham High School,

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,200
which lost 40 students and four
faculty members in the crash.

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,700
But it was the events
after the crash

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,900
that has turned this tragic story
into something even stranger.

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,700
The survivors who managed
to get off the plane before it crashed

10
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,900
died soon thereafter
in a series

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,400
of mysterious
and bizarre accidents.

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,800
Now, to some, these deaths
are just tragic coincidences,

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,000
but to others,
they're an indication

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,600
that there are more
sinister events taking place.

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,600
That's the contention
of tonight's guest.

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,600
Thank you for joining us
this evening.

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,200
Thank you for having me.

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,400
And I appreciate you using
the word sinister.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,000
Most people say supernatural
because they think I'm talking

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,400
about ghosts and witches
and stuff like that.

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,000
Here's your chance
to set the record straight.

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,500
Great. Okay.

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,200
I believe that there's
a sort of force,

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,200
an unseen malevolent
presence...

25
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,300
that's all around us
every day.

26
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,700
And it determines
when we live and die.

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,200
And some people call
this force the devil,

28
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,900
but I think that
whole religious thing is...

29
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,300
so I prefer to call it
Death itself.

30
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,900
So I'm surrounded by Death?

31
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,100
Absolutely. Absolutely.

32
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,600
Every day, everywhere,
all the time.

33
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,300
And that's what I want people
to understand...

34
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,300
that Death
has this grand design

35
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
that we all fit into.

36
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,200
So when Alex Browning
got off that plane

37
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,500
and took the other
survivors with him,

38
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,000
he basically screwed up
Death's plan.

39
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,900
And that's what I'm trying
to warn people about.

40
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,100
And the fact that all
of the survivors have died

41
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,300
is your evidence of this?

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,900
Well, it's not so much
that the survivors died,

43
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,100
but it's the way
that they died.

44
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,600
I mean, there were
so many weird,

45
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,400
seemingly random things
about the way they died.

46
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,100
It just didn't
make sense.

47
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,200
And that's the proof
there's something out there...

48
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,900
Wait, that's not proof.
That is your interpretation

49
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,100
of events that can't be proven
in order to support your ideas.

50
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,300
Kimberly.

51
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,600
You should be more
open-minded...

52
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,500
What happened after that
was just coincidence.

53
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,600
May I finish?

54
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,600
Mere coincidence would have
one or two of these kids die.

55
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,900
But not all of them
including their teachers.

56
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,400
Yes, but people die
all the time,

57
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,900
so why should this be
any different?

58
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,400
It forced people
to question

59
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,000
these so-called
everyday coincidences.

60
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,000
What if they
were something more?

61
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
What if you could do
something about it?

62
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,000
Please, are you listening
to yourself? This is crazy.

63
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,400
You're saying we should be on guard
every morning when we leave the house?

64
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,200
That's exactly what
I'm saying.

65
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,500
Exactly it.

66
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,400
And in order
to survive...

67
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,900
the only way to survive

68
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,200
is to look beneath
the visible world.

69
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,200
Because in the end no one
can escape death.

70
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,900
And today may be
your day to die.

71
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,300
Okay, I'll call you.

72
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
Kimberly, are you sure
you've got everything?

73
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Credit card,
cell phone, Triple-A card?

74
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,100
Dad, it's Daytona,
not Somalia.

75
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,900
Alright. Fix-a-flat, road flares,
sunblock, mace?

76
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,400
Condoms,
whips, chains.

77
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,200
Just kidding,
Mr Corman.

78
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,000
Don't worry,
I'll keep an eye on her.

79
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,700
That makes me feel
a lot better, thanks.

80
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,200
- Okay.
- Alrighty.

81
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Can we go get the guys?
I'm getting horny.

82
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,600
Go on.

83
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,800
Okay, I'll call you.

84
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,700
Whips and chains.
That's nice.

85
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,100
Whatever,
your dad's cool.

86
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,200
Buckle up!

87
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Watch it!

88
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,500
- Oh, easy, Kimmy. First year of driving?
- Sorry.

89
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,800
- Oh my God.
- Fucking freak.

90
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,100
Yo, Dano,
shouldn't we help your mum?

91
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,100
Good one, man.
You're hilarious.

92
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,800
You're not getting any of my weed.
Nothing.

93
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,000
Whatever.

94
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,400
What are we going to do
in Daytona?

95
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,700
We're going to see lots
of honeys there.

96
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,600
We're gonna get drunk, we're gonna smoke
this big 'El Gagerero,'

97
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,500
We're gonna have this
awesome party...

98
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,200
Pileup! Pileup!

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,300
A candlelight vigil to mark
the one year anniversary

100
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,500
of the crash of Flight 180
will be held at 8:00 P.M. Tonight

101
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,700
at the Mt Abraham
high school auditorium.

102
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,100
.' Highway to hell... .'

103
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,900
Oh my God.

104
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,000
- Hello?
- Hey, Kimberly, it's Dad.

105
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,300
- Hey, what's up?
- Your car's leaking transmission fluid.

106
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,900
- So I want you to get it checked right away.
- Okay, yeah.

107
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,600
I'll do that.

108
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,600
I mean it. Take care of it.

109
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,200
- Is that someone coughing?
- Yeah, okay.

110
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,500
I'll take care of it.
I'll talk to you later.

111
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,400
- I love you.
- Bye, honey.

112
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,100
- What did you do?
- Look at those titties!

113
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,700
- Shut up.
- You missed that?!

114
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,100
That's too bad.
That's too bad.

115
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,200
Oh, shit!

116
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,200
Fuck man, there's a cop behind us!
Pull in the right lane now!

117
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,800
Shit.

118
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,000
Seriously, put it out.

119
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,100
- Put that thing out.
- Alright.

120
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,800
Wait, wait, wait!

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,600
- Get rid of it.
- Shit.

122
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,600
Hey, it's Kat.

123
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,600
Listen...
what the hell?!

124
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,500
Just wait. Not you.

125
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,300
I think we better pull over
and check the car, because...

126
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,900
Kimberly, the car
is going to be fine.

127
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,200
Your dad's going to be fine,
you're going to be fine.

128
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,100
Okay?

129
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,500
Look at that guy.

130
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,700
He's drinking a beer.

131
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,200
Oh, yeah,
that's real responsible.

132
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,800
You ever hear
of the ozone layer, arsehole?!

133
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,500
.' When it comes to this drug shit
I was made to play.'

134
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,800
.' Don't come around if
you ain't got no cocaine to bring... '

135
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,000
What? I'm wearing
my seatbelt.

136
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,700
You're gonna bust me,
bitch?!

137
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,600
Aaah!

138
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,100
Son of a...

139
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,600
bitch.

140
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,300
Fuck!

141
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,000
- Oh my God!
- Watch out!

142
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,000
- Stop!
- Oh my God!

143
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,900
Watch out!
Aaah!

144
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,700
Shaina?

145
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,600
I can't get out of here!

146
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,000
Help me!

147
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,800
Oh, easy, Kimmy.
First year of driving?

148
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,100
Yo, Dano,
shouldn't we help your mum?

149
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,300
Good one, man.
You're hilarious.

150
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,600
Pileup! Pileup!

151
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,400
- Oh my God.
- What?

152
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,400
There's going to be
a huge accident.

153
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,300
We're all gonna die!
I just saw it.

154
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,900
That's it.
My turn to drive.

155
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,400
- No, I'm serious.
- Kim, what's wrong?

156
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,400
- What are you doing?
- Oh my God.

157

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,400
'Highway to hell.'
'Highway to hell... '

160
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,000
'Highway to hell'?

161
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,500
.' I'm on a highway to hell... '

162
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,200
Okay, Kimberly,
you're scaring me.

163
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,700
- Green means go, Kimmy.
- Yeah.

164
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,000
Are you out of your friggin' mind?
What the hell are you doing?

165
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,600
What the fuck, Kimberly?

166
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,700
What's this?

167
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,700
Kimberly, you just got
to breathe.

168
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,600
Oh, shit, shit.
Five-O's coming. Let's fucking roll.

169
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,500
- What?
- Oh my God.

170
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,400
Do you know how much
fucking weed I have on me? Huh?

171
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,900
Okay, Dano, just shut up!
Just stay cool.

172
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,400
Oh, fuck. I'm going to jail.
I'm fucking going to jail.

173
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,700
What's going on here?

174
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,100
I think there's going
to be a huge pileup.

175
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,200
I saw it.

176
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,200
There were bodies
everywhere.

177
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,200
There were logs...
I saw it.

178
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,900
It just happened.

179
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,200
Alright, miss, I'd like you to please
step out of the vehicle.

180
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Just pull over!

181
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,800
I know,
Mummy's hungry, too.

182
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,500
Come on.

183
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,800
Come on!

184
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,900
Oh, fuck this.

185
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,200
I'm going to get this
and we're going to go.

186
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,900
Fuck.

187
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,200
What the hell
is going on up there?

188
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,800
Excuse me!

189
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,500
Is there any way
that we could drive around?

190
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,500
- I have a delivery...
- You need to get back into your vehicles.

191
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,400
- Just move it...
- Now!

192
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,400
That's it!

193
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,900
That's the truck
that's going to kill everybody.

194
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,800
You need to stop
that truck!

195
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,700
I told you again,
you have to calm down!

196
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,400
Why won't you listen to me?!

197
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,200
- Fuck!
- Oh my God.

198
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,800
This is unit 13 requesting
medical assistance

199
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,600
and backup for a major
traffic accident...

200
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,900
Kimberly, what's going on?

201
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,100
No!

202
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,000
No!

203
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,300
Listen, sir,
this girl is really freaked out.

204
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,700
In fact, all of them are...

205
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,900
- scared as you can imagine.
- Scared?!

206
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,200
These people are the luckiest
sons of bitches on the planet.

207
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,700
Get this guy,
Evan Lewis...

208
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,500
yesterday the kid
wins the lotto.

209
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,600
Today, some loony bitch
blocks traffic

210
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,600
and he avoids the worst
pileup in years.

211
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,300
I should be
so damn 'unlucky.'

212
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,900
Go babysit the rest of them.

213
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,700
I'll be done with Lewis
in a minute.

214
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,800
Hey, excuse me...

215
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,700
We're trying to do
the best we can.

216
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,400
We're going to get you
out of here as soon as possible.

217
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,100
I just think it's a bunch
of bullshit.

218
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,800
Listen, I know
you've gone over all this

219
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,800
with Detective Suby...

220
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,200
but would you mind
telling me what happened?

221
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,900
It was like I was there.

222
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,000
I knew something bad was going
to happen even before it did.

223
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,600
- I just felt wrong, just like...
- Just like what?

224
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,900
Look, I know
this sounds crazy but...

225
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,300
you guys all heard
about Flight 180, right?

226
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
The kid who got off
the plane?

227
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,700
Well, it happened
a year ago, today.

228
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,900
My premonition
was just like his.

229
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,700
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.

230
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,600
You must have read
about the kid

231
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,500
who had a dream
about a plane blowing up,

232
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,600
so he got all his buddies
off the plane

233
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,300
and then the thing blew up
just like in his dream?

234
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,900
- Yeah.
- But did you hear what happened after?

235
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,300
So a month goes by, right?

236
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
Everything seems cool.

237
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,400
But then all the survivors
start to die one by one.

238
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,100
'Cause when your number's up,
your number's up, right?

239
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,000
You know, some people even say that
Death itself was stalking them,

240
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,400
hunting each one down

241
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,000
until they were all...
dead.

242
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,700
Please.

243
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,500
There was one survivor.

244
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,300
Clear Rivers is
in a padded room

245
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,100
at the Stonybrook Institution.

246
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,800
Well, that's encouraging.

247
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,300
Okay, you want me
to believe that this is true,

248
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,100
that this is happening
all over again?

249
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,300
I don't know why
we're even here.

250
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,500
What do you want from me?

251
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,200
But if I was never meant
to pull over,

252
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,800
we all should have died
in that pileup.

253
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,800
Which means Death
could be coming for us.

254
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,800
Yeah, like, what if

255
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,400
we're all getting that 'Different Strokes'
curse or something?

256
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,300
I think you're all
are certifiable.

257
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
I can't believe I've been listening
to this crap.

258
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,300
Let's go.
Let's go, Tim.

259
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,200
Mrs Carpenter, please.

260
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,800
Kimberly!

261
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,100
Oh baby!

262
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,800
- Are you okay?
- I'm so sorry.

263
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,500
Shh, shh.

264
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,900
You can all go now.
Thank you for your patience.

265
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,400
Could I ask you something?

266
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,800
Anything.

267
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,600
Did Mum ever have any...

268
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,300
I don't know,
weird feelings about anything?

269
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,200
What do you mean?

270
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,300
Like visions or premonitions.

271
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Sweetie, are you sure
you're okay?

272
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,600
Dad, I know
this sounds crazy,

273
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,000
but I'm really scared
for the others.

274
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,800
I don't know,
I have this really bad feeling.

275
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,700
What?

276
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,400
It's not over yet.

277
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,500
Jesus Christ!

278
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,500
Shit!

279
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,800
Hey, Evan, it's Tawny.

280
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,800
Sorry I haven't called.

281
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,600
Hey, listen, I heard
about your lottery win.

282
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,300
Let's hook up.
Call me.

283
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,800
Yeah.

284
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,600
Hi, Evan, it's Nikki.

285
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,900
We met at Tucker's party
last year?

286
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,500
I know it's been awhile,
but I've been thinking about you.

287
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,300
I just wanted to say
congratulations.

288
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,400
So give me a call.

289
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,700
555-0123. Bye.

290
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,200
You little bastard.

291
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,900
Shit.

292
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,700
Come on.
Come on.

293
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,100
Fuck. Fuck.

294
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,200
Come on!

295
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,900
Come on.

296
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,800
Fuck!

297
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,300
Jesus!

298
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
Oh!

299
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,200
Hey, this is Evan.
Leave a message.

300
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,800
If you're looking for Rick,
I don't know where he is,

301
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,600
and I don't know
when he's coming back. Thanks.

302
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,600
Evan, call me when you
get in, you lucky fuck!

303
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,300
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

304
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,100
Aah!

305
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,100
Jesus!

306
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,400
Come on.

307
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,100
Aah!

308
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,700
Shit, I'm lucky.

309
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,900
Aah!

310
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,000
Jesus Christ!

311
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,900
No, Mother,

312
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,600
just turn on any station.

313
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,900
Well, I don't know how you missed it,
it's been on all day.

314
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,600
Yes, Mother,
Channel 4 is fine.

315
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,800
Okay... here it is!
I got to go, okay?

316
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,800
I got to go!

317
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,600
To recap our top story,

318
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,200
Route 23 was backed up
for almost nine hours today.

319
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,500
A record-breaking pileup
killed an estimated 18 people.

320
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,500
Emergency crews spent hours
sifting through the wreckage

321
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,700
hoping to recover any survivors
from this tragic collision.

322
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,800
So far police are refusing
to release the names of the victims

323
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,600
until the families
are notified.

324
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,600
The camera
of a highway patrol car

325
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,500
managed to catch
this shocking footage.

326
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,600
- A semi comes...
- Oh my God.

327
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,600
And smashes
into a red SUV.

328
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,200
- The driver of the SUV...
- No, um...

329
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,800
leave it.

330
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,300
...may have
saved her life.

331
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,200
He pulled her back
at the last second

332
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,300
just as the semi ploughed
into the vehicle.

333
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,100
The passengers inside
the SUV...

334
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,100
Oh, oh, oh! You guys see that?!
Shit, I was there, baby!

335
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,100
In other news, a freak accident took
the life of a lotto winner.

336
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,100
- Friends say Evan Lewis...
- Hey, shh.

337
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,900
Was on top of the world after
recently winning $250,000.

338
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,600
But in tragic turn of events,
Lewis died today

339
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,300
while trying to escape a fire
in his apartment.

340
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,100
He managed to make it out
of the building,

341
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,400
but somehow the ladder
on the fire escape

342
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,400
slipped and impaled him.

343
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,000
Investigators believe Lewis
died instantly.

344
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,200
Come in.

345
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,600
Hey, buddy.

346
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,900
I want you to take this
so you can get some sleep.

347
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,000
And then tomorrow it's off to the dentist,
which I know you love.

348
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,600
Now, get some rest.

349
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,700
- Mum.
- Yeah?

350
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,900
You think those guys
were BSing us today?

351
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,700
Yeah.

352
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,100
Some people just need
some rewiring, that's all.

353
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,100
Lights out.

354
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,600
At the request
of the patient,

355
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,700
you'll relinquish
any sharp objects

356
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,100
such as: 'nail files,
pencils, pens,

357
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,100
safety pins, bobby pins,
your necklace,

358
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,800
matches, lighters,
belts, belt buckles,

359
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,900
earrings, hair clips,
glasses, shoelaces,

360
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,000
paper clips, watches, money clip,
pocket knives,

361
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,800
food, drinks, keys,
cell phone... '

362
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,100
You have a cell phone
on you?

363
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,100
'... poisons, pills,
medications.'

364
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,700
Great. And let me see
your nails.

365
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,400
Good. Then I think
we're all done.

366
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,400
Wait.

367
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,400
Is she dangerous
or something?

368
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,500
No, honey,
she expects you are.

369
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,200
No, no, no.

370
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,500
Get him off me.
Get him off me!

371
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,600
How long are they gonna keep
her locked up like this?

372
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,200
Depends on her, I guess.
She's voluntary.

373
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,900
- Clear Rivers?
- Don't come any closer.

374
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,600
They told me you had something to do
with the crash on Route 23.

375
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,700
Look, I don't know how
to explain it,

376
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:28,000
but I saw the pileup
before it happened.

377
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,700
And I saved some people.

378
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,100
And now you think Death
is after you.

379
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Nice work.

380
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,300
Maybe if you're real lucky,
you'll wind up in here with me.

381
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,600
Anything else?

382
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,000
One of the people died
in a freak accident last night.

383
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
What if the other people
are in danger, too?

384
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,700
If you put them on the list,
they're already dead.

385
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,100
List? What list?

386
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,300
Death's list.

387
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,000
The survivors of Flight 180

388
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,400
died in the exact order

389
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,200
they were originally meant
to die in the plane crash.

390
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,500
That was Death's original design.

391
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,500
The list.

392
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,000
I was supposed to die
in that crash with my friends.

393
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,800
So you're telling me
that I'm next?

394
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,900
You said someone else died
last night.

395
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,100
That means someone must
have intervened.

396
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:25,300
Officer Burke pulled me away
from the crash that killed my friends.

397
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,400
Congratulations.

398
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,100
You'll be the last to go.

399
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,700
But don't worry,
once the others are dead,

400
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,500
it'll come back for you.

401
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,800
It always does.

402
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,900
This doesn't make sense.

403
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,200
You said that you die in
the order you're originally meant to.

404
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,100
But my friends died last
in my premonition, not first.

405
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,200
Wait.

406
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,600
Died last?

407
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,600
Backwards.

408
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,700
Are you sure?

409
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,400
In my premonition

410
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,400
that Nora woman
and her kid died.

411
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,500
Then Evan,
then me and my friends.

412
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,700
Why is this even
happening to me?

413
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,600
That's what Alex used
to ask himself.

414
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,600
So, what am I
supposed to do?

415
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,600
Clear.

416
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,100
Watch out for the signs.

417
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,900
What?

418
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,300
Have you ever seen anything
creepy or ominous?

419
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,100
An in-your-face irony
kind of thing?

420
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,900
The songs on the radio.

421
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,900
Yeah, the guy in the beer truck,
everything on the road.

422
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,200
Well, don't ignore it.

423
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,900
Recognising those signs usually means
the difference between life and death.

424
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,600
You got to help me.

425
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,300
I don't have
to do anything.

426
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,000
But you beat it.

427
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,900
Take a look around.

428
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,900
What did I beat, Kimberly?

429
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,500
If you were smart, you'd save yourself
and just forget about the others.

430
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,100
How can you say that?
You have a responsibility.

431
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,400
My friends are dead.

432
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,400
That's how I can say that.

433
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,600
This is what happened to Alex
when I was responsible for him.

434
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,700
Get out.

435
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,200
Before you hurt me or yourself.

436
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,900
- Alright, you know what?
- What?

437
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,400
I think you're a coward.

438
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,200
You hide out in here
because you're

439
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,300
too damn bitter and selfish
to help any other person.

440
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,400
In my opinion,
you're already dead.

441
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
I tried calling you
last night,

442
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,500
but your father said
you were sleeping.

443
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,400
- Evan Lewis is dead.
- Yeah.

444
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,700
I've been getting calls all morning from
everyone who was on the on-ramp.

445
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,900
We're meeting tonight
at my apartment.

446
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,200
Wait, so...
you believe all this Death stuff?

447
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,100
Well, at first,
no, I didn't.

448
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,200
Until last year
when I was dispatched

449
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,600
to clean up one
of the Flight 180 survivors.

450
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,500
Clean up, I don't...

451
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,400
- Did you see that?
- See what?

452
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,000
- Pigeons.
- Pigeons?

453
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,000
- It's a sign.
- A sign of what?

454
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,900
If Clear's right
about the order,

455
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:03,100
then Nora and Tim are going
to be attacked by pigeons.

456
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,800
I'm not following you.

457
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,500
They're next
on Death's list.

458
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,100
If we don't find them,
they're going to die.

459
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,700
The doctor's ready
for you, now.

460
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,700
If he gives me the gas

461
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,900
and I wake up
with my pants unbuttoned...

462
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:06,400
- we ain't paying.
- Tim.

463
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,800
There you are.
What happened to you yesterday, Tim?

464
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:18,800
We missed you in here.

465
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,300
We got hung up by that accident on
Route 23.

466
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,000
Good Lord.
How lucky that you're okay.

467
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,900
Your mum says you've been
having some pain lately.

468
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,200
Not really.

469
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,400
I'm disappointed, Tim.

470
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,900
Does your mum know
you've been smoking?

471
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,100
Uh-huh.
Ow.

472
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,300
Yeah, that one's going
to have to be filled.

473
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,500
Damn those pigeons.

474
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,900
How many times am I going to have to
replace those goddamn windows?

475
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,300
We can't do it, boss,
we can't do it!

476
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,000
This will only sting for a moment.

477
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,300
Open big.

478
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,000
Little bit wider.

479
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,000
Wider.

480
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,400
Okay.

481
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,800
Oh God.

482
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,700
How do they
expect me to...

483
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,300
Would you rather just have
the laughing gas?

484
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,700
- Yeah.
- Okay.

485
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,700
Jean, I'm going
to need you in here.

486
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,400
You'll have to speak up,
there's too much noise.

487
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,400
What?!
I can't hear you!

488
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,600
Excuse me, what?!

489
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,700
Yes, the sixth at 2:00 P.M.

490
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,500
Jean! Let me
get this started.

491
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,400
Tim, you'll be awake,
a little groggy,

492
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,600
but you're not going
to be able to move much.

493
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,200
Okay, great, thanks.
Alright, turn around.

494
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,500
The cleaning lady said they're at
the Ellis Medical Complex off of 14th.

495
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,200
God damn it anyway.

496
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,700
- Okay, I got it.
- I can't find a box!

497
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,600
Not again. Careful.

498
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,500
There we go.

499
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,900
Jean,
how's Tim doing in there?

500
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,800
What did he say
about your tooth?

501
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,000
- Did he say...
- I can't remember.

502
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,800
- Nora!
- The pigeons!

503
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,100
What? Pigeons?

504
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,000
Hey, whoa, whoa!
Kid, kid!

505
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,800
- No-oo!
- Tim!

506
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,100
Look out!

507
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,200
- Stay back, stay back!
- No! Please, no!

508
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,800
Nora's not coming.
She won't leave her son.

509
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,800
- No, but she's next...
- Right now I don't think she cares.

510
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,100
This is really
happening again, isn't it?

511
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,400
I hoped we'd get there

512
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,400
and they'd be fine,

513
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,800
and Clear Rivers
was just full of shit,

514
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,600
and Evan Lewis' death
was just some freak accident.

515
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,800
But we're all going to die,
aren't we?

516
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,200
I'm so scared.

517
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,100
I know you didn't ask
for any of this...

518
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,900
but I don't think you have it
in you to quit either.

519
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,100
A second one just died.

520
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,000
A 15-year-old kid.

521
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,200
I hope you're ready for this.

522
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,300
It's this way.

523
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,100
How is this guy going
to help us anyway?

524
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,600
He seemed to know
a hell of a lot more

525
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,700
about Death
than he ever told us.

526
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,800
Shouldn't we knock first?

527
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,200
He probably already knows
we're coming.

528
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,500
Hello, Clear.

529
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,300
I've been expecting you.

530
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,300
Oh my God.

531
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,600
- That's Evan Lewis.
- Come to pick my brain?

532
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,800
Just a simple question and we'll leave you
alone with your new friend.

533
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,500
Dead...

534
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,300
yet still fresh.

535
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,800
Look, we drove
a long way to get here,

536
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
so if you happen to know
how to stop Death,

537
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,800
it would be really great
if you told us.

538
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,500
You can't cheat Death.

539
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,300
- There are no escapes.
- Bullshit.

540
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,300
You told me Death
has a distinct design.

541
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,600
But Alex and I cheated Death,
not once but dozens of times.

542
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,200
The design is flawed,
it can be beaten.

543
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,000
Such fire in you now.

544
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,600
People are always
most alive

545
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,400
just before they die.

546
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,300
Don't you think?

547
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,500
Look, please...

548
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,100
if you know of anything
that could help us,

549
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,200
what harm could it do?

550
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,700
Only new life
can defeat Death.

551
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,000
What the hell
does that mean?

552
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,400
Some people say there's a balance
to everything.

553
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,300
For every life
there's a death,

554
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,700
and for every death
there is a life.

555
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:53,500
But the introduction of life
that was not meant to be,

556
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,000
that can
invalidate the list,

557
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:59,300
force Death
to start anew.

558
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,800
You have to follow
the signs...

559
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,700
Kimberly.

560
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,900
How do you know my name?

561
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,200
- Whoa!
- Wait a second.

562
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,300
'New life defeats death'?
'Follow the signs'?

563
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,300
Where did you
find that guy?

564
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,100
I thought he was supposed
to help us,

565
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,700
not freak us out.

566
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,500
What the fuck
are you thinking?!

567
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,800
I'm thinking suck on my junk,
bee-atch.

568
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,700
Little punk.

569
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,600
What is it?

570
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,100
What did you see?

571
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,700
You have to tell us,
what did you see?

572
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,900
Kimberly, look at me!
You have to tell us.

573
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,100
What did you see?!

574
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,100
I was driving a white van.

575
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,500
I don't know,
I must have lost control,

576
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,400
because I crashed
into a lake.

577
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,700
- And I drowned.
- You were there?

578
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,700
I can practically taste
the water in my mouth.

579
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,600
Wait, remember, the on-ramp?

580
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,400
There was a pregnant woman
in a white delivery van.

581
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,700
He said only new life
can defeat death.

582
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,900
If she gives birth
to a baby

583
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,900
that would've died
in that car crash...

584
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,600
a brand new soul that was never part
of Death's design...

585
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,300
It throws the whole list
out of whack

586
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,500
and we start over
with a clean slate.

587
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,600
- It seems like a reach, don't you think?
- What else could it mean?

588
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,800
We have to find
the pregnant lady's number.

589
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,400
I don't have it.
She never came to the station.

590
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,400
We have to warn her about the lake
so she can stay alive to have the baby.

591
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,700
- That'll be an easy conversation to have.
- How are we gonna find her?

592
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,400
There could be thousands
of white vans in the state.

593
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,800
Hey!

594
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,700
I'm a cop, remember?

595
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,700
Wait, that's it.

596
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,500
Got it.

597
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,100
With the plate number
I can put out an APB.

598
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,200
Here we go.

599
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,100
The vehicle
is a delivery van

600
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,600
registered to Marcus
and Isabella Hudson.

601
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,100
We should pick them up
pretty quickly.

602
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,000
Come on, let's get
to the meeting.

603
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,500
Hey, hold the door!

604
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,900
Hey, let go of my shoe!

605
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,800
Give me my shoe!

606
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,700
I wrote to management two weeks ago
about these friggin' bumpers.

607
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,900
Is that dogshit, dude?

608
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,800
Eww.

609
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,200
Oh, you got something
on your...

610
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,500
It's still there, bro'.
Here, I can get it for you.

611
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,600
No, it's alright.

612
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,700
I'll do it
if you want me to do it.

613
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,000
Just let... I'll...
Let me do it.

614
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,800
What?

615
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,000
Hey, man,
how you doing?

616
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,200
Listen, any word
on that white van yet?

617
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,900
Okay, keep checking.

618
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,900
Does anybody have a Valium?

619
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,900
Oh, yeah.

620
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,600
Here.

621
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,100
You're just going to want to take
half of that.

622
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,800
Keep 'em coming.

623
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,200
If what you're saying is true,

624
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,900
that means I'm next.

625
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,400
This is crazy, people, come on.

626
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,600
First Death
is stalking us,

627
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,100
and now premonitions?
What?

628
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,900
You're not next, Nora.

629
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:52,200
Nobody has to be next.
That's the point.

630
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,400
We need to help each other
in order to get through this.

631
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,200
This cannot be happening.

632
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,000
See, because my career
is at a peak

633
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,100
and I finally met
a quality guy.

634
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,800
I just bought a house.

635
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Maybe if you shut the fuck up,
you'll live.

636
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,300
Like I'm going
to take advice from you.

637
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,100
Okay, look,
if you know what to look for,

638
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,800
you have a fighting chance.

639
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,300
If I call and say,
I don't know... subway...

640
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,700
Get to a high-rise fast.

641
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,800
A place where no subway
could ever possibly go.

642
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,900
Get it?

643
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,300
Okay, you guys, listen...

644
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,500
just because Kimberly
has these visions,

645
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,300
it doesn't mean
we're not all capable

646
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,200
of seeing signs
to some extent.

647
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,000
Okay, okay, look.

648
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,600
I gotta call bullshit.

649
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,300
I mean, I've sat here
and listened

650
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,400
to all your theories
and all your stories,

651
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,500
and I think it's just
all bullshit.

652
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,300
Call it what you want!

653
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,100
- It'll keep your arse alive.
- Darlin', my arse is alive!

654
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,200
Has been all day.

655
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,700
There is nobody after us
but you,

656
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,000
trying to make us all crazy.

657
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,000
I should have seen that coming.

658
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,500
Yeah.

659
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,800
If Death is out to get you,

660
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
why don't you get
the hell away from us?

661
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,200
She's the only one that's
dealt with this before.

662
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,400
We need to look out
for each other from now on.

663
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,000
Sleep in shifts.

664
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,400
We need to safe-proof
this death-trap.

665
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Get you to step out
of the van, miss?

666
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,100
Are you kidding me?

667
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:46,300
- What did I do?
- This vehicle's been reported stolen.

668
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,500
Ohh!

669
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,800
Screw this.
I'm going for a smoke.

670
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,500
No, no, no,
it's not safe out there.

671
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:58,200
So, Nora's got
to bite it before me anyhow, huh?

672
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,200
Oh, you people have
no sense of humour.

673
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,300
Nora, you okay?

674
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,600
Four years ago
my husband died.

675
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,800
Now Tim.
There's nothing left for me.

676
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,800
Don't say that, okay?

677
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,400
If it is my time to go
and be in heaven...

678
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,100
with my family,
I can accept that.

679
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:28,900
You got to trust me.
We can fight this.

680
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,000
If we just stick
together long enough

681
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,600
for her
to have her baby...

682
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,200
If you'll excuse me,
I have a funeral to plan.

683
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,100
Nora.

684
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,700
What do you think
you're doing?

685
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,300
- I'm finished. I'm out.
- Don't leave, Eugene.

686
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,300
Look, look.

687
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,400
I control my life, alright?

688
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,400
Not some crazy list that
Death has put together.

689
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,900
I'll be sure to carve
that into your tombstone.

690
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,500
Whatever. You may be able
to scare these people,

691
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:01,000
- I'm not buying that shit.
- Be careful, man.

692
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,700
- Hey.
- What?

693
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,700
Even if you don't believe,
give this to Nora.

694
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,700
I'm just going
to put this in the...

695
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,500
closet.

696
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,800
Sorry.

697
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,100
Whoa.

698
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,100
Man with hooks?

699
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,100
Man with hooks.

700
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,600
Hey, I think I see
a man with hooks.

701
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,900
Is that...

702
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,400
- a sign?
- Oh my God.

703
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,000
- Do you guys see that?
- He's right.

704
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,600
- The phone.
- Shit.

705
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,600
What the fuck?

706
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,700
- Hello?
- Nora!

707
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,700
- Who is this?
- Can you hear me?!

708
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,400
Officer Burke,
I can't...

709
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,200
I can't hear you!
What?!

710
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,500
What does he...
What?!

711
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,700
A man with hooks
is going to kill you.

712
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,300
- What, what?
- Oh...

713
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,000
What is it, Nora?

714
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:32,100
No!

715
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,500
- Wait, wait!
- Let go!

716
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,400
Wait, wait, Nora!

717
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,400
- Get me out of here!
- Will you stop it?!

718
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,900
Let me help!

719
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,400
Let me go!

720
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,900
Let go of me!

721
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,700
Kat!

722
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,900
Help me!

723
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,400
- Wait!
- I don't want to die!

724
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,300
Aah!
Let me out of here.

725
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,400
I got it, thanks.
They found the van.

726
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,400
Isabella's being held at
the Greenwood Lake sheriff's station.

727
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,700
I'm in control of my life!

728
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,000
- Kiss my arse!
- Eugene, what is it?

729
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,100
- I control my life!
- What happened, Eugene?

730
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,900
- You hear me, you Reaper cocksucker?!
- Calm down.

731
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:49,300
- What happened? Where's Nora?
- Back the fuck up!

732
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:52,200
- Whoa, whoa, okay!
- Back the fuck up!

733
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,900
Eugene, what's wrong?
Just tell us what happened.

734
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:57,000
Alright, give me
the gun, Eugene.

735
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,200
- Give me the gun.
- No! Fuck no!

736
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,400
Eugene, you just got
to relax, bro', okay?

737
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,600
You just got
to calm down, man.

738
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,500
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun, Eugene!

739
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,400
- No, no, no, no!
- Don't do it! Don't do it!

740
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,700
- I ain't going out like that.
- Hey, Eugene, no!

741
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,400
- On my terms!
- Oh my God!

742
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,400
You hear me!

743
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:19,300
God!

744
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,200
Oh!

745
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,700
You don't keep it loaded?

746
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,800
- Maybe they're all duds.
- Six in a row?

747
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,200
Never.
That's impossible.

748
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:41,500
It wasn't his turn to die.

749
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:45,600
Can we find
the pregnant woman, now, please?

750
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,900
Is this safe, guys?

751
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,400
I mean, someone in this car
is about to get whacked.

752
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,000
Do the rest of us really feel
like sitting next to him?

753
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,900
Or her?

754
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,000
Hopefully her.

755
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,100
Okay, guys,
let's not panic.

756
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:10,800
- Isabella's safe.
- How do you know?

757
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,200
You said she was going
to drive into a lake.

758
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,100
How can she if she's
in protective custody?

759
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,400
Look at me.

760
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,500
Come on.

761
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,600
Does it look like
I'm in the condition

762
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,100
to commit grand theft auto?
This is insane.

763
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,100
Look, hopefully
the district judge

764
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:38,100
will have it all sorted out
by Monday morning, okay?

765
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,700
Marcus.

766
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,200
Marcus, Marcus.

767
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,600
When I get out of here,
I am going to sue his...

768
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,500
- Oh my God.
- What, what now?

769
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,600
My water just broke.

770
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,600
- What?
- My water, it just broke.

771
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,400
- I'm gonna have my baby.
- No, not here.

772
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:06,400
- No, you can't do this to me.
- Don't just stand there!

773
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,500
- Get me to a hospital!
- Give me a second to think!

774
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,900
I am not going to have my baby
in a jail cell!

775
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,700
Get me to the hospital!

776
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:16,700
Okay, okay!

777
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:19,800
Sheriff Perry,
this is Deputy Adams, come back.

778
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,600
God, I need the car!
Sheriff Perry, I need the car!

779
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:26,000
My van! My van!
Take my van!

780
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,900
Okay. Okay.

781
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:32,100
Yeah, we'll go.
We'll go.

782
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:34,200
Yeah, we'll go.

783
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:39,600
Come on,
come on!

784
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,800
Y'all want to hear
something crazy?

785
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
It's not the first time
I cheated Death.

786
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,500
A kid came to school
with a knife...

787
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,400
killed his teacher.

788
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,400
Teacher would have
been me,

789
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:04,100
but I was transferred to another
school two days before.

790
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,300
That's fucking weird, man.

791
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:07,700
You want weird?

792
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,900
Last year my partner and I
were heading out

793
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
when a call came in
about a train wreck.

794
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,300
Frank decided
to let me handle it alone.

795
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,600
He died that night
in a shootout.

796
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,800
If that call had come in
just 10 seconds later,

797
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:24,800
I'd be dead, too.

798
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,000
Oh my God.

799
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:28,900
I'm sorry.

800
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:30,600
It's just I got one, too.

801
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,900
Okay, so last May
I'm supposed to go and stay

802
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,600
at this cheesy little
bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania.

803
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,600
Anyhow, there's this major gas leak
that no one knows about,

804
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,100
and all the guests suffocated
during the night.

805
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:42,500
So what happened?

806
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:44,200
I don't know.
I never made it.

807
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,000
The bus I was on splattered
some girl all over the road.

808
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,500
Was that in Mt Abraham?

809
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:51,900
Yes. How did you know?

810
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,700
That bus you were on killed
Terry Chaney.

811
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:58,300
She was supposed to die
on Flight 180.

812
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,300
Hey, do you guys remember
that theatre in Paris

813
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:07,100
that collapsed last year
and killed everybody inside?

814
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:11,300
Well, I had tickets to go.

815
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,800
But one night I'm in Paris

816
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,100
and I'm just
tripping on acid

817
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,400
and sipping lattes and such.

818
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,400
And then all of a sudden

819
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,600
this dude out of nowhere

820
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,100
just gets whacked
by this falling sign.

821
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,900
- Carter.
- Wait, wait, wait.

822
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:32,600
The teacher I replaced,
her name was Val Lewton.

823
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:35,600
She was from Mt Abraham.
She died in an explosion.

824
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,600
Shit. The call about
the train wreck

825
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,300
that saved my life...

826
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,700
that was the night
I scraped up Billy Hitchcock.

827
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,400
Wait a minute.
Who are these people?

828
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,800
The people who got off
of Flight 180.

829
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,700
They were my friends.

830
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,400
Kimberly,
tell us what happened.

831
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:04,700
About a year ago my mum and I
were at the mall.

832
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,800
I was supposed
to meet her outside,

833
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:09,300
but I got caught up watching
this news report

834
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,300
about some kid
that committed suicide.

835
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:14,600
I kept thinking,

836
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,100
'How can you strangle yourself
in the bathtub?

837
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,000
That's stupid.'

838
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,600
It felt wrong.

839
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:25,500
And yet...

840
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:31,700
I heard some gunshots
and I ran outside.

841
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:36,400
Some kids were trying
to steal my mum's car.

842
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,100
She tried to fight them off,
she was a fighter,

843
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,300
and they killed her.

844
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:46,400
After the funeral I kept thinking that
it should have been me.

845
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,000
I guess everyone must
think that.

846
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,700
But I guess I was right.

847
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:05,800
Get there.
Could you drive a little faster maybe?!

848
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,800
- I'm going as fast as I can.
- God!

849
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
When we got off
Flight 180,

850
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,000
it didn't just change
our lives.

851
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,500
It affected everyone
and everything

852
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,800
we've come
into contact with since.

853
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,900
I'm not sure
I'm understanding you.

854
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:24,400
Being alive after
we were supposed to die,

855
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,500
it caused an outward ripple.

856
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,500
A rift in Death's design.

857
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:31,600
So if you had never
gotten off the plane...

858
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,300
we wouldn't be alive
in the first place.

859
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:37,900
Yes, that's why Death
is working backwards!

860
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:40,100
It's tying up
all the loose ends,

861
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,500
Sealing the rift once
and for all.

862
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:05,900
Oh, shit!

863
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,600
Jesus Christ!

864
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:14,200
Hang on! Hang on!

865
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,600
- Is everybody alright?
- Oh God.

866
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:40,700
God, Eugene!

867
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,800
- He can't breathe.
- Oh, my legs!

868
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:48,500
No, please.

869
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:51,300
- It's not going to wait.
- I got to go help those people.

870
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,600
Do you want to deliver
this baby?

871
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:58,000
Those people can help.
Let's go.

872
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,000
Officer Adams reporting
a vehicle collision

873
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,200
off 9-A
at the 180 mile-marker.

874
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,100
Send all emergency vehicles
to the scene.

875
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:09,200
- We have to go. Go!
- Okay, okay, okay!

876
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:12,000
Just... okay, okay!
We're going! We're going!

877
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:16,700
- Easy, easy.
- Here, here, here.

878
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,000
I think he has
a collapsed lung.

879
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,600
- Everyone okay?
- Call an ambulance!

880
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,000
Stay with us.

881
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,500
Hey, hey you!

882
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:34,500
Hey! Come on.
Help me out.

883
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:38,100
You got to get me out of here before
this thing explodes or something, okay?

884
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:42,600
I think it's okay.

885
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,900
I don't smell any gas
and nothing's dripping.

886
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,800
Alright, get this thing off me.
Just pull. Hurry.

887
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,000
Okay. Be careful.
Ready?

888
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:54,400
Oh God, Jethro!
Jesus Christ!

889
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,800
I got to be able to use
my legs when I'm done.

890
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I'm so... Dad!

891
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,800
Eugene, everything's
going to be okay.

892
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:09,600
If he doesn't get a respirator,
he's not going to make it!

893
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,600
We're going to get you to the hospital.
Be careful with that!

894
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:16,000
Check the gauges on the regulator,
and watch out for overdoses!

895
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:19,200
- And look out for potholes and puddles.
- You can't come in, miss.

896
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,100
And watch out
for power lines!

897
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:26,600
Watch it!

898
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,600
You trying to get yourself killed,
little boy?

899
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,000
You got to use
your head, man.

900
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:38,800
Get that news van back.

901
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,500
Thanks.

902
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:49,900
Okay, let's go.

903
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,500
How is she doing?

904
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:10,700
I think she's going
to be okay.

905
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,200
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

906
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,200
When I die...

907
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,100
is it going to hurt?

908
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,300
I don't know.

909
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,600
You're going to die after me, right?

910
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,700
Yeah, I guess so.

911
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,700
Would you take these?

912
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,400
And if I die...

913
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,000
would you throw out
all my drugs

914
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,900
and my paraphernalia
and my porno?

915
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,100
You know...

916
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,500
anything that's going
to break my mum's heart.

917
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,500
Please?

918
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:06,500
Thank you.

919
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:12,600
This is Cheyenne Jacobson

920
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,600
reporting live
from the Gibbons farm.

921
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,400
Sheriff Perry,
Officer Burke here.

922
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,100
I'm trying to get some
information on Isabella...

923
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:21,100
She did?

924
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,800
Okay. Thanks.
Great.

925
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,400
Kimberly!

926
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:28,000
Isabella's at Lakeview Hospital.
They're prepping her for delivery.

927
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:30,100
- We got to go now.
- What about Kat?

928
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,400
I'll go talk to her.

929
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,300
Hi.

930
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,900
Just find Isabella and get this thing
over with, okay?

931
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:38,700
Go on, I'll be fine.

932
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,700
- Where's Rory?
- I don't know.

933
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:54,600
Could you be a little quieter
with that thing, please?

934
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:57,500
Yeah, sure.
I'll just put it on quiet mode.

935
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,100
That would be good.

936
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:28,400
Rory.

937
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,700
Oh my God!

938
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:48,800
Somebody get out there!

939
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,800
- We have to get to the hospital now!
- Well, take my truck!

940
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,400
The keys are in it.

941
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,500
Kimberly!

942
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,100
Kimberly!

943
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,300
- Kimberly.
- What do you see?

944
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,800
- What are we looking for?
- It's not here.

945
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,600
This one was different.

946
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,700
It was like the van crashing
into the lake.

947
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,800
I was in a hospital,
there was screaming

948
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,600
and a nurse was trying
to choke me.

949
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,300
I couldn't see her,
but I could see her name tag.

950
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,300
It was right in my face.
Kalarjian.

951
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:37,100
I think a nurse named
Kalarjian is going to try and kill Isabella.

952
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:44,100
Listen to me, Isabella!
I need you to stop pushing!

953
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:45,700
What's wrong?
Is my baby alright?

954
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:48,200
The cord's around the neck.
This baby's in trouble.

955
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:51,100
A bizarre accident
has left two people dead,

956
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:54,000
one of them killed
by a safety device meant to protect us.

957
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,600
Ironically, the woman
was impaled through the head

958
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:59,000
after her emergency airbag
deployed.

959
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:02,600
She was trapped in her vehicle after it
crashed into a field near Greenwood Lake.

960
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:05,200
Suddenly the airbag went off...

961
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:41,700
Isabella Hudson!
What room is she in?

962
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:43,900
We may need to do
a stat Caesarean!

963
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:45,800
Get Dr Kalarjian
up here now!

964
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,600
Dr Kalarjian, code blue.
Delivery room six.

965
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,100
I'm just going
to wait outside,

966
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,100
'cause I'm just really
in the way here.

967
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,100
- Don't you dare leave me!
- Okay, okay.

968
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:56,000
You guys, get to Isabella!

969
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,900
I'm going to find Eugene!

970
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:01,100
Dr Kalarjian, code blue.
Delivery room six.

971
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:04,100
Dr Kalarjian, delivery room six.
Code blue.

972
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:22,100
Dr Kalarjian,
in here, hurry!

973
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,500
That's her.

974
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,100
Wait, wait, wait!

975
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,600
Contractions have stopped.

976
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:10,200
Arrest in descent halfway
through the birth canal.

977
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,400
Bad tracing,
it's losing oxygen.

978
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,600
The cord's compressed!

979
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,900
- Down to 40.
- Oh God! What's happening?!

980
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:19,700
Where's Kalarjian?!

981
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:22,500
Dr Kalarjian!

982
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:24,700
- Dr Kalarjian!
- Not now, I'm busy.

983
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:28,000
- Ow! Hey! Hey!
- Police business.

984
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,800
Just push a little more.

985
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,300
Oh, no.

986
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:44,100
Isabella, is the baby okay?

987
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,000
I'm sorry.
You can't be here.

988
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:49,600
- I have to ask you to leave.
- I need to know...

989
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,500
I need to know if the baby's alright!

990
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,000
It's a boy.

991
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,700
Thank you.
Congratulations!

992
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:20,800
Who the hell are they?

993
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:23,200
Oh my God!

994
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,800
- Clear.
- I can't find Eugene.

995
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:31,500
- No, don't worry. She had the baby!
- It's okay.

996
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:33,600
It's over.
It's okay.

997
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,500
- Kimberly.
- What did you see?

998
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:52,900
I don't think Isabella
was ever supposed to die in that pileup.

999
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:55,300
Then what's the premonition
of the lake supposed to mean?

1000
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,200
Try to remember.

1001
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:17,800
Bloody hands.
Someone with bloody hands.

1002
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:20,400
Eugene.

1003
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,900
Only new life defeats death.
What is that supposed to mean?

1004
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:29,900
You saw an ECG machine
and what else?

1005
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:33,900
Bloody hands.
What else did you see, Kimberly?

1006
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:36,500
Wait.

1007
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:40,300
Eugene.

1008
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:02,300
Oh God, no!

1009
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:14,300
Bloody hands.

1010
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,200
It's me.
The premonitions are about me.

1011
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,400
- What?
- Crash cart.

1012
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:22,000
Let's go! Move it!

1013
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,200
Dr Kalarjian.

1014
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,000
ECG machine.

1015
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,200
The lake.

1016
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,200
The white van.

1017
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,700
What are you talking about?

1018
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:47,300
New life.

1019
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:51,600
What is it?

1020
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,000
I know what I have
to do to save us.

1021
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:58,400
- I have to die.
- No, that's crazy.

1022
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:01,600
You can't give up now.
We have to fight this thing.

1023
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,300
Get Kalarjian.

1024
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:36,900
Only new life can defeat death.

1025
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:39,800
If it is my time to go
and be in heaven...

1026
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,200
with my family.
I can accept that.

1027
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:45,400
Flight 180...

1028
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,800
I know what I have to do
to save us.

1029
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
There are no known survivors.

1030
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,000
I have to die.

1031
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,200
Ready and clear!

1032
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:58,400
Nothing!

1033
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:03,500
Ready and clear.

1034
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,800
Nothing.

1035
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,500
- Come on.
- Ready, clear.

1036
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:13,600
She's back!

1037
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:16,100
Epinephrine.
Two milligrams, IV push.

1038
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:19,000
I want her prepped
and stabilised for ICU.

1039
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,800
Welcome back.

1040
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:28,100
They lost you
for a minute there.

1041
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:37,400
Hey. We did it.

1042
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,500
Thanks to you,
we cheated Death.

1043
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:14,700
Would you like some wine?

1044
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:16,900
I think I'll stick
to our beer, thanks.

1045
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:18,400
Alright.

1046
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:20,800
This is really great,
Mrs Gibbons.

1047
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

1048
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,100
It's our pleasure.

1049
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,700
- How are you doing, Kimberly?
- Good. Yeah.

1050
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:32,000
I had a fun summer.

1051
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,300
I don't know, I guess things are
pretty much getting back to normal.

1052
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:41,100
Brian, I think you better
go check that barbecue.

1053
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:43,800
Hey, careful.
Those things are dangerous.

1054
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:46,200
Trust me.
I think I've been through closer calls.

1055
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:49,300
Yeah, me too. Dad, you should tell them
about the news van thing.

1056
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:51,200
What's that?

1057
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:54,500
Brian was almost hit by that
news van that day in the field.

1058
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:57,200
And your friend Rory,
he pulled him back at the last second.

1059
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,800
- Saved his life.
- You never told me that, Peter.

1060
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:02,600
Boy, that was lucky.

1061
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:09,700
Brian!

1062
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:19,500
I'm right behind you

1063
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:21,900
Here I come

1064
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:28,500
Let me remind you

1065
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:31,200
You're on the run

1066
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:39,400
My name is Death

1067
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:45,200
Come taste my
peppermint-laced breath

1068
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,600
All lights are diamonds

1069
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:55,600
Behind dark glass

1070
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:01,400
She leans toward me

1071
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:04,700
A forward pass

1072
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,200
In the blood,
come-a, come-a cow cud

1073
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,400
Nobody really cares
about you now, bud

1074
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,900
Pay the price, roll the dice
run the maze like-a mice

1075
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:17,200
Ashes ever turn to dust
for the two of us

1076
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:21,300
My name is Death

1077
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:26,400
Come taste my
peppermint-laced breath

1078
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:31,300
My name is Death

1079
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:35,400
Come taste, come taste

1080
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,300
Come to the party

1081
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:41,400
The price is free

1082
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:51,100
You seem to persist
hanging on the fount beauty

1083
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:59,100
My name is Death

1084
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:03,800
Come taste my
peppermint-laced breath

1085
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:08,500
My name is Death

1086
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,800
Come taste my

1087
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,100
Peppermint-laced

1088
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:16,700
My name is...

1089
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:20,500
Death...

1090
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:24,500
