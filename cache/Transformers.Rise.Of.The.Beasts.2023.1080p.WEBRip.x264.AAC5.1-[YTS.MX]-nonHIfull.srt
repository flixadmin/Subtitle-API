1
00:00:56,523 --> 00:01:00,862
<i>There's a legend that precedes
the dawn of our civilization.</i>

2
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:05,432
<i>A vile god,
so large and so powerful</i>

3
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:09,402
<i>that it consumed
entire planets as fuel.</i>

4
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,806
<i>Few believed such a thing
could be true,</i>

5
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,444
<i>until the day we saw Unicron
with our own eyes.</i>

6
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,337
<i>But he didn't just come
for our planet.</i>

7
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,539
<i>He wanted
our greatest technology,</i>

8
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,775
<i>the Transwarp Key.</i>

9
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:53,281
<i>And he sent his most powerful
henchman to collect it,</i>

10
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,448
<i>Scourge.</i>

11
00:02:44,432 --> 00:02:45,765
More enemies are landing.

12
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,335
We won't be safe for long.

13
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:48,535
Do we have the key?

14
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:51,439
You must take it.

15
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,107
Keep it hidden,

16
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,210
so that it never falls
into the hands of Unicron.

17
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:58,778
But, Apelinq, we can fight.

18
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:02,716
No. Protecting our Transwarp
Key is all that matters!

19
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,019
Go. Use it to escape.

20
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:06,988
What will you do?

21
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:09,991
I'll hold him off.

22
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:11,892
Buy you some time.

23
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:13,593
Then I'm staying with you.

24
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,695
This is my fight.

25
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,834
Listen, if Unicron
were to get the key,

26
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:22,103
he could open a portal
through time and space

27
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:25,006
with no end to the worlds
he could destroy.

28
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:29,110
It is now your time
to lead the Maximals,

29
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:31,278
Optimus Primal.

30
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:57,505
So you're
this planet's great warrior.

31
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:04,611
You have such a beautiful world

32
00:04:06,147 --> 00:04:09,984
filled with
an abundance of life.

33
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:14,554
Savory.

34
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,791
My master grows hungry.

35
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:23,730
Give me the Transwarp Key,
and he will spare your home.

36
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:27,368
We'd rather die than let
him reach other planets.

37
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:30,770
So be it.

38
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:50,723
Benefits of serving
the almighty Unicron.

39
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:56,063
They never learn.

40
00:04:56,197 --> 00:04:59,033
You're too late, Scourge.

41
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:03,104
Your master will be trapped
in this galaxy forever.

42
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:09,844
No!

43
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,818
<i>His sacrifice will be our oath.</i>

44
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:19,987
<i>To preserve the key,</i>

45
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:22,356
<i>no matter the cost.</i>

46
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:36,170
You let them slip away
with the Transwarp Key.

47
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:40,808
Scour the universe and find
where the Maximals have gone.

48
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:45,712
When you acquire the key,
use it to bring me to you.

49
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,915
Yes, my lord.

50
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:54,221
Once I have the key,
I alone will reign supreme.

51
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:56,617
All right, baby, come on.

52
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,319
Show me the money.
Show me the money.

53
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:04,959
Here we go. There we go.

54
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,428
<i>Yo, Sonic. Breakfast ready yet?</i>

55
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:10,431
I ain't your butler, Kris.

56
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:13,434
<i>Come on, man.
No names over the airwaves.</i>

57
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:14,935
<i>It's Tails.</i>

58
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:16,804
My bad,

59
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,940
Kristopher Diaz
from 974 Wilson Avenue,

60
00:07:20,074 --> 00:07:21,809
Apartment 2-C, Brooklyn.

61
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,844
<i>No real names.
They're listening.</i>

62
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:27,381
Ain't no secret government
agencies worried about us, Tails.

63
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,450
Now get your behind out here
while it's hot.

64
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,519
At least they got that going for
'em. Here, I ironed this for you.

65
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:35,155
I already ironed it. What...
Like you cooked those eggs?

66
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,858
What you mean?
They're just... seasoned.

67
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:40,294
Aw, come on.

68
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:41,629
Come eat, bro.

69
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:44,031
I can't get past Bowser.

70
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,633
Well, good morning to you too.

71
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,534
Drink this
and take your medicine.

72
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,637
- All of it.
- Okay.

73
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,071
Are you sure you can take him?

74
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:53,641
Yeah, hospital's
on the way. I got time.

75
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,744
And, if that lady,
that administrator, is there

76
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:58,379
and she mentions a bill,

77
00:07:58,512 --> 00:07:59,513
just...

78
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,516
tell her we're handling it.

79
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,853
I will. And after today,
I'll be able to help out more.

80
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,022
Good luck on the interview.

81
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,724
Don't forget to laugh
at all their jokes.

82
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:13,594
White people love that shit.
Ma, language.

83
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:17,498
Okay!
Remember, I have class tonight, so I'll be home late.

84
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,033
<i>Lo quiero.</i>
I love you.

85
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,935
Hurry up, man.
We gotta get into the city.

86
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:27,608
Hey. Hold up. Hold up.

87
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,443
Your hand's hurting again?

88
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:32,179
No, it's nothing.

89
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,181
Yo, let me see.

90
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,052
Kris.

91
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:43,157
It's swollen.

92
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,093
The sickle cells must be
blocking the blood flow again.

93
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,728
How long has this been going on?

94
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,430
Couple days.

95
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,066
Hey, yo, look, I told you,

96
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,567
you gotta tell me these things.

97
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:56,603
You fighting this alone,
or we fighting it together?

98
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,239
Together.

99
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:01,842
Home team?

100
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:02,976
Home team.

101
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:12,519
Two for ten. Two for...
Stop touching everything.

102
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,521
Hell, no.
Kris, what'd I tell you

103
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:17,791
about letting your mans come out
the crib looking like a whole square?

104
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,793
Only so much I can do.

105
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,695
Yeah, whatever, bro.
Look. Here.

106
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,931
Ooh! My dawg!

107
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:27,634
When you gonna let me put your skills
to work and get you some real money?

108
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:30,003
Yeah. Says the dude
who can't even afford cable.

109
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:31,405
"Says the guy who..."

110
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,374
I choose not to purchase cable.

111
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:36,176
It's my own personal way
to protest the vampiric nature

112
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,145
of modern-day capitalism!

113
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,714
Hey, good luck with that
interview in that dusty suit!

114
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,973
I'm coming.

115
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,441
Hey, guys. That's a good one,

116
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,710
but the Ankylosaurus
was an armored dinosaur.

117
00:10:23,892 --> 00:10:26,727
- Thank you, thank you...
- for being patient.

118
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:28,195
Intern? Intern?

119
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,832
I paged you three times.
Why didn't you call me?

120
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,168
Okay, well, I figured if I stopped
to call, that would make me later.

121
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,703
The police are here.

122
00:10:36,838 --> 00:10:38,405
They busted an art auction.

123
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:41,175
The owner claims
that everything is authentic,

124
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,111
but they want a second opinion.

125
00:10:45,446 --> 00:10:46,480
All right.

126
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,652
The da Vinci sketch is legit.

127
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:53,153
The painting's a copy.

128
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:55,489
Real one's at the
National Gallery in London.

129
00:10:56,858 --> 00:10:58,392
Roman vase.

130
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:02,029
Valuable, but you are not
gonna retire off of them.

131
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:07,134
This Greek curse tablet,
it would be expensive,

132
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:08,569
but it's a fake.

133
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:10,003
How can you tell?

134
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:12,506
See the spelling? Roman.

135
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,475
Doesn't even show up
in that era.

136
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:16,043
Got it.

137
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:19,546
Officers,
I figured it out. So...

138
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,650
The da Vinci, that is real.

139
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:34,728
Now, where did you come from?

140
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,644
What are you?

141
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:53,547
It's pretty neat, right?
Yes.

142
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,482
Where is it from?

143
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:57,384
They just discovered it
in Sudan.

144
00:11:57,518 --> 00:12:01,355
The boys say it's Horus,
fifth millennia BC, Nubian?

145
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:04,491
This symbol is definitely
not hieroglyphic.

146
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,261
Well, if it's as exotic
as it looks,

147
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,496
I'm gonna get a feature
in <i>Minerva.</i>

148
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,332
Jillian?

149
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,503
Okay, team, let's do it.

150
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:35,924
Okay, what are the rules?

151
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,192
Bros before hos.

152
00:12:41,963 --> 00:12:43,031
"Don't be a problem.

153
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,464
Don't go looking
for a problem."

154
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,767
- Or else we're gonna...
- Have a problem.

155
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:48,002
I know, I know.

156
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,736
Okay, I'll be back
in a little bit.

157
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,345
Mr. Diaz?

158
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,515
Hey, I know we're
a little behind on the bill.

159
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:04,848
Three months behind. Until your account
is current, you can't bring your brother.

160
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,553
I've told you that.
I'm gonna fix it.

161
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,923
I need a little more time.
Take him to the ER.

162
00:13:09,057 --> 00:13:11,792
Well, they won't see him in
the ER unless he's critical.

163
00:13:11,926 --> 00:13:13,560
Mr. Diaz.
He's 11!

164
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,363
He's 11 years old.

165
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,401
Come on, Kris, we gotta go.

166
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,538
What happened? I'll tell
you later, man. All right?

167
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:26,173
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

168
00:13:29,844 --> 00:13:30,878
Hey, yo. Sit here.

169
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,148
And don't move!

170
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:38,352
<i>After a conference with Simpson's
attorney, Howard Weitzman...</i>

171
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,287
Can I help you?
Yes.

172
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,900
Hey, I'm here for an interview
with the head of security, Mr. Bishop.

173
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:44,391
I'm Noah Diaz.

174
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:46,894
It's been canceled. No.
No, that has to be a mistake.

175
00:13:47,028 --> 00:13:48,795
Came right from Mr. Bishop.

176
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,834
Just need your authorization...

177
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:54,501
Mr. Bishop! Hey! Hey!

178
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:56,904
It's okay, Walker.

179
00:13:57,038 --> 00:14:00,273
It's me, Noah Diaz. Sir, I think
your boy back there is confused.

180
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,576
He said our interview was
canceled. Because it is.

181
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:05,312
Wait, why? On the phone you
said I was perfect for the job.

182
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:06,914
You said this
was just a formality.

183
00:14:07,048 --> 00:14:09,583
It was until your old commanding
officer called me back.

184
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:13,186
Said you were brave, an
expert com tech, but unreliable.

185
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,554
Couldn't trust you.

186
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,423
Your head was always
somewhere else.

187
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,191
Sir, I can explain all of that.

188
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:20,725
I had some responsibilities at
home. My brother, he's sick...

189
00:14:20,828 --> 00:14:23,196
You had a responsibility
to the United States Army.

190
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,298
Mr. Bishop! Sir.

191
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:28,268
I'm a hard worker, okay?
I just...

192
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,371
I just really need a break.

193
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:35,776
Listen, I can't have someone
like you mess up what I've built.

194
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,178
Someone like me?

195
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,886
You don't know anything
about me!

196
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:47,889
I know you don't know
how to be part of a team.

197
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:51,625
God.

198
00:14:52,894 --> 00:14:53,894
Hey, look.

199
00:14:53,928 --> 00:14:55,462
Superman went
on a bunch of interviews

200
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:58,498
before he got his job
on the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

201
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:01,368
But he never gave up.
I'm not Superman, Kris.

202
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:02,769
Life ain't a comic book.

203
00:15:02,904 --> 00:15:05,272
I'm just saying.
You'll get the next one.

204
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,407
Yo, there is no next one.

205
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:10,277
No one's coming to save us.
We're alone in this.

206
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,554
Yo, man, I'm sorry.

207
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:22,354
It's all right.

208
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,825
No, it's not.

209
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:28,830
None of this is.

210
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:37,704
You know what?

211
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:39,740
Come on.

212
00:15:41,943 --> 00:15:43,710
Yo, here, bro.

213
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:46,413
Just head upstairs. I'll
be right there, all right?

214
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,020
So what was you
talking about earlier?

215
00:16:13,174 --> 00:16:14,242
Hey, yo, you want one?

216
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,476
No. I don't want any candy.

217
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,411
You gotta relax, man.

218
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:20,480
Your energy
is really affecting my chi.

219
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:22,917
And I get it. I was
nervous my first time too.

220
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,053
But you might want to do some breathing
exercises, or something. Look at me.

221
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,294
My man, my man, my man, my man.

222
00:16:35,096 --> 00:16:37,731
It's just
I ain't done this before.

223
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:40,534
I know that.
But them rich cats in there,

224
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,602
they give a ton of paper
to charities every year

225
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:44,404
to make themselves feel better.

226
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:47,875
If you look at it from a holistic
perspective, we doing them a favor.

227
00:16:48,976 --> 00:16:51,813
Hey, yo! You're
welcome! Will you stop?

228
00:16:51,946 --> 00:16:55,448
What are you doing? This ain't
about to affect they pockets at all.

229
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,018
And it's about
to be easy as hell.

230
00:16:57,151 --> 00:16:59,619
So why you ain't the one
going in there and doing it?

231
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:02,190
Because, <i>papito,</i>
I'm the mastermind.

232
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:04,892
Now come on,
put this in your ear.

233
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:07,494
My man, you serious?
Yo, is that even clean?

234
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:11,431
It's the fourth quarter, we got
about ten seconds left on the clock,

235
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:13,500
and you got the rock.

236
00:17:14,135 --> 00:17:15,669
Get rid of this.
Hey, man!

237
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:19,339
Don't slam the...

238
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,480
Okay. I am off
to my fundraiser.

239
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,783
What do you think?
It's nice.

240
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:33,921
Um, can I...
Can I run something by you?

241
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:38,792
So I've been doing
some research,

242
00:17:38,926 --> 00:17:41,963
and I don't think
that the statuette is Horus.

243
00:17:42,096 --> 00:17:44,265
As a matter of fact,
I'm sure it's not.

244
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,068
The boys dated it
around 5000 BC, right?

245
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:49,904
But the Nubians,

246
00:17:50,037 --> 00:17:51,815
they never even had contact
with the Egyptians

247
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,640
until 600 years after that.

248
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,309
The symbol's not hieroglyphic.

249
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:57,482
I don't even think it's
from that part of the world.

250
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,914
I think it might
be Aztec or Inca.

251
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,718
It's not some Egyptian god.
It's something else.

252
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:11,391
Interesting.

253
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:12,927
Get those pressed, okay?

254
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:36,817
<i>Yeah.</i>

255
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:40,487
There you go.
Let that breath fill you up.

256
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,324
<i>In... out.</i>

257
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,192
Please stop talking.

258
00:18:45,326 --> 00:18:48,129
Okay, all right, I get it, you don't
like to chitchat back and forth.

259
00:18:48,262 --> 00:18:49,397
But I got something for you.

260
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,568
You got a robbing mix tape?

261
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:56,702
<i>No.</i>

262
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,506
I got a liberating mix tape.

263
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:13,553
You feeling that?

264
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:14,889
Yeah, whatever.

265
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,098
<i>All right, there shouldn't be
nobody in this part of the building.</i>

266
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:26,666
<i>You should be able
to just waltz right on in.</i>

267
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,639
Strike one, mastermind.
This place is packed.

268
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,875
Hey, well, to error is divine.

269
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:36,776
<i>Just act like you own the place.</i>

270
00:19:36,911 --> 00:19:39,479
Hey, wassup, brother?
Good to see you again.

271
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,949
<i>Try not to look suspicious.</i>

272
00:19:44,285 --> 00:19:47,355
Here you go. Here you go.
Sorry. Sorry. That's you, bro.

273
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:50,191
Nice glasses. I didn't know...
I didn't know you had glasses.

274
00:19:50,324 --> 00:19:52,759
<i>What are you doing,
making friends?</i>

275
00:20:00,935 --> 00:20:03,536
<i>Everything good?</i>
We're in the mix.

276
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,543
Hey. Let's see
what you really are.

277
00:20:21,155 --> 00:20:23,491
<i>Now, my man said
it's tucked in the back.</i>

278
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,259
Been there a couple weeks.

279
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,029
<i>It's like a grayish car</i>

280
00:20:28,162 --> 00:20:29,263
<i>with like a...</i>

281
00:20:29,397 --> 00:20:30,865
Blue stripe.

282
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:49,150
<i>All right, now just
like brother Reek showed you.</i>

283
00:20:49,283 --> 00:20:50,317
Down the window...

284
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:52,887
a little wiggle...

285
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,956
feel that snag and...

286
00:20:57,491 --> 00:20:58,492
<i>yeah.</i>

287
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,560
Now we making money.

288
00:21:25,453 --> 00:21:26,786
All right.
Talk to me, homey.

289
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:27,921
<i>I'm in.</i>

290
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:29,090
This won't hurt a bit.

291
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:47,174
Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

292
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,047
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

293
00:21:58,052 --> 00:22:01,088
I'm gonna lose my job.

294
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,126
I'm gonna go to jail.

295
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:24,211
It's definitely not Nubian.

296
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:03,984
This cannot be.

297
00:23:04,118 --> 00:23:07,054
Calling all Autobots!
Calling all Autobots!

298
00:23:07,188 --> 00:23:08,755
<i>Yippee-ki-yay, mother...</i>

299
00:23:15,196 --> 00:23:17,764
Prime, this is Arcee.
I have a visual.

300
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:19,333
What am I looking at?

301
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,269
A way home.

302
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:28,842
<i>Calling all Autobots!</i>

303
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:31,178
<i>Calling all Autobots!</i>

304
00:23:35,382 --> 00:23:37,952
- What am I doing?
<i>- Well, the coast is clear out here,</i>

305
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:40,688
<i>so whenever you want to slide
that thing on out, you good.</i>

306
00:23:40,854 --> 00:23:42,256
I can't. I can't.

307
00:23:42,389 --> 00:23:44,358
<i>Like you can't
drive stick or something?</i>

308
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:47,061
No, it's just...
I ain't no thief.

309
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:49,230
<i>Are you having
an existential crisis now?</i>

310
00:23:49,363 --> 00:23:51,523
The deadline for that was
when I offered you Twizzlers.

311
00:23:51,632 --> 00:23:53,234
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

312
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:55,402
<i>Can you hear me, Mirage?
Roll out!</i>

313
00:23:55,536 --> 00:23:57,104
Who the hell was that?

314
00:23:57,238 --> 00:23:59,573
That's the radio, bro.
This car is buggin'. I'm out.

315
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:03,010
Hey!

316
00:24:03,644 --> 00:24:04,644
Shit!

317
00:24:04,712 --> 00:24:06,647
Shit.
Hey, you!

318
00:24:08,382 --> 00:24:10,618
Get out of the car!

319
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,921
I'm trying! The car
started by itself, I promise!

320
00:24:14,054 --> 00:24:15,656
Look, it's not working!
Get out now!

321
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:26,400
No! Wait! What you doing?

322
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:27,635
Noah, what's...

323
00:24:30,838 --> 00:24:33,173
Reek! Reek! Reek!

324
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:35,276
Now, that's top-tier
manifestation!

325
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,479
Yo, the car's driving by itself!

326
00:24:40,614 --> 00:24:41,715
Noah, you good?

327
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:43,017
I don't know what's going on!

328
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,385
It won't stop!

329
00:24:44,518 --> 00:24:46,654
Yo, stop! Stop!
Why aren't you listening?

330
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,223
You might wanna slow down.
It's not me, it's the car!

331
00:24:49,356 --> 00:24:50,958
- It's possessed!
<i>- No, no, no.</i>

332
00:24:51,091 --> 00:24:52,760
You're just
on an adrenaline high.

333
00:24:52,893 --> 00:24:54,728
Let's do some of them
breathing exercises.

334
00:24:56,196 --> 00:24:57,931
Yo, I don't need
no breathing exercises!

335
00:24:58,065 --> 00:24:59,233
The car's driving by itself!

336
00:25:01,235 --> 00:25:02,803
Snap.

337
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:04,738
Yo, Reek, what do we do?

338
00:25:04,872 --> 00:25:06,740
Noah, I cannot hear you.

339
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:08,509
<i>Reek!</i>
Noah, I can't...

340
00:25:10,711 --> 00:25:13,781
No, he did not!
No, he did not just leave me!

341
00:25:16,483 --> 00:25:18,485
Pull over!
Help me!

342
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,120
Are you ok...

343
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,696
Drive. Drive, drive,
drive, drive, drive!

344
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:18,612
The bridge.
The bridge, the bridge...

345
00:26:18,746 --> 00:26:19,814
Take the Williamsburg!

346
00:26:28,489 --> 00:26:31,392
I got a 10-37 in progress.
Silver Porsche.

347
00:26:33,828 --> 00:26:35,362
You serious, man?

348
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,036
Nah. Nah.

349
00:26:50,845 --> 00:26:52,546
Hell, do something, please!

350
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:09,062
Yo, nah. Nah, nah, nah.

351
00:27:15,002 --> 00:27:16,236
<i>Come in, come in.</i>

352
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,472
<i>Can you hear me, Mirage?</i>
Mir-what?

353
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:33,287
Mirage.

354
00:27:54,408 --> 00:27:57,044
Yo, yo, yo, slow down!
Slow down!

355
00:28:08,088 --> 00:28:11,592
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
That felt good!

356
00:28:11,725 --> 00:28:15,362
Get some oil pumping,
you know? Damn!

357
00:28:15,496 --> 00:28:17,130
I've been cooped up
forever, dude.

358
00:28:17,264 --> 00:28:19,166
I can't tell you
how old it gets!

359
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:21,168
"Mirage, stay hidden.

360
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:24,104
Mirage, don't draw
any attention to yourself.

361
00:28:24,238 --> 00:28:29,309
Mirage, <i>Big</i> is just a movie.
You'll never be a real boy."

362
00:28:29,443 --> 00:28:32,112
But that was fun, man.
You're fun, dude.

363
00:28:32,246 --> 00:28:36,083
Right. This is probably
a lot for you?

364
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:40,687
Back up! Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa. What's with the aggression?

365
00:28:40,822 --> 00:28:42,957
I thought after the car
chase, we were boys.

366
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,225
Are you gonna hit me?
Maybe.

367
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:48,762
It's like that?

368
00:28:51,732 --> 00:28:53,734
Tough guy.

369
00:28:53,868 --> 00:28:56,603
I like that.
I like it a lot.

370
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:58,205
What are you?

371
00:28:58,338 --> 00:29:00,240
Some sort of possessed car
or something?

372
00:29:00,374 --> 00:29:02,844
Nah.
That's not real, man.

373
00:29:02,977 --> 00:29:03,977
I'm an alien.

374
00:29:04,044 --> 00:29:05,947
Like... Like E.T.?

375
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,282
E.T.? The little ugly guy
in the basket?

376
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:11,285
Look at this face!
The name's Mirage.

377
00:29:13,453 --> 00:29:15,322
Come on. Give me a little,
give me a little.

378
00:29:15,455 --> 00:29:17,025
Give me a little.
Give a little tap.

379
00:29:17,157 --> 00:29:18,292
Give me a little tap.

380
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:20,294
There you go.
Now we're friends!

381
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:23,297
Great. The gang's here.

382
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,366
There are more like you?
Like me? Nah.

383
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,936
But be cool
so they don't crush you.

384
00:29:28,068 --> 00:29:30,771
What? Yeah, I'd put that
pipe down if I were you.

385
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:02,502
<i>Well, well,
who have we got here?</i>

386
00:30:07,174 --> 00:30:08,876
Mirage, what have you done?

387
00:30:10,177 --> 00:30:12,112
You brought a human here?

388
00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:14,648
Optimus!
Hey! Looking good, man!

389
00:30:14,781 --> 00:30:16,316
Wait a second.
Are those new rims?

390
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,418
You were told to stay hidden.

391
00:30:18,552 --> 00:30:20,654
Right, right.
Crazy coincidence.

392
00:30:20,787 --> 00:30:22,924
When you called,
all Optimus-like...

393
00:30:23,057 --> 00:30:24,892
"Autobots, roll out!"...

394
00:30:25,026 --> 00:30:26,793
this guy was already in the car.

395
00:30:26,928 --> 00:30:29,162
But he's cool,
so it's cool. Cool?

396
00:30:29,296 --> 00:30:30,832
Not cool.

397
00:30:34,234 --> 00:30:36,104
Who are you, human?

398
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:38,138
I'm nobody.
I ain't even seen nothing.

399
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:40,041
I'm not even seeing
anything right now.

400
00:30:40,173 --> 00:30:41,876
Arcee.

401
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:47,414
Private Noah Diaz, US Army.

402
00:30:47,547 --> 00:30:50,417
Multiple commendations.
A wizard with electronics.

403
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,285
He's a soldier.

404
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:54,721
He does not look like a soldier.

405
00:30:54,856 --> 00:30:58,993
I mean, you looking
pretty rough yourself.

406
00:30:59,127 --> 00:31:00,594
Sorry, sir.

407
00:31:00,727 --> 00:31:03,797
I will deal
with your mistake later.

408
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:10,604
Okay, the energy surge we felt
was in the 4,000 yottahertz range,

409
00:31:10,737 --> 00:31:12,572
which is undetectable to humans.

410
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:15,776
I've reconstructed the source
from the energy echoes.

411
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:19,446
I cannot believe it.
It exists and it is here.

412
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:21,448
<i>What the hell am I looking at?</i>

413
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:22,950
The Transwarp Key.

414
00:31:23,084 --> 00:31:25,987
It was thought to be lost
thousands of years ago.

415
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,424
<i>It was once used
to open space-time portals</i>

416
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:34,028
<i>to Energon-rich planets
throughout the universe.</i>

417
00:31:34,162 --> 00:31:36,496
You mean Energon-rich
planets like...

418
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,764
Cybertron.

419
00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:40,734
After seven long years
stranded on Earth,

420
00:31:40,868 --> 00:31:43,004
we've finally found a way home.

421
00:31:43,137 --> 00:31:44,738
Wait till I catch you, Reek.

422
00:31:44,872 --> 00:31:48,142
Okay, so where
is this t-tran, t-trun...

423
00:31:48,275 --> 00:31:49,476
Transwarp Key?
Thank you.

424
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:51,344
It's in the new museum
on Ellis Island.

425
00:31:51,478 --> 00:31:54,481
<i>Let's blow it up
and get the hell out of Dodge!</i>

426
00:31:54,614 --> 00:31:57,617
No, we can't just go in
blasting and steal it, Bee.

427
00:31:57,751 --> 00:31:59,386
The humans will hunt us down.

428
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,056
What we need is a quiet way in.

429
00:32:07,527 --> 00:32:08,795
Ooh, how about him?

430
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,998
- No.
- What? Come on, man.

431
00:32:11,132 --> 00:32:13,667
He could slip in right through
one of them little doors,

432
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:16,369
grab the key, leave a
nice IOU and peace out.

433
00:32:16,503 --> 00:32:19,073
He's perfect.
What?

434
00:32:19,207 --> 00:32:21,441
No, it is a bad idea.

435
00:32:21,575 --> 00:32:23,543
I agree with Big Man.

436
00:32:23,677 --> 00:32:26,848
So, it's been real, y'all.
But...

437
00:32:26,981 --> 00:32:28,615
Time-out.
Mirage.

438
00:32:28,749 --> 00:32:31,451
I know. I know. Just relax. Let
me just talk to my guy real quick.

439
00:32:31,585 --> 00:32:35,288
Yo, don't leave me with these
tight-asses, bro. We make a great team.

440
00:32:35,422 --> 00:32:37,058
This is a waste of time.

441
00:32:37,191 --> 00:32:39,994
Look, I'm not breaking into a
museum for some space robots.

442
00:32:40,128 --> 00:32:42,295
But what about for friendship?

443
00:32:43,164 --> 00:32:45,365
Or, or, or

444
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:47,701
what about for cash?

445
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:51,671
You help us get this key,
so we can get off this rock...

446
00:32:51,806 --> 00:32:54,142
No offense.
Love the neighborhood and all.

447
00:32:54,274 --> 00:32:56,443
And then I let you sell me.

448
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,846
Lambo?

449
00:32:59,814 --> 00:33:00,814
Ferrari?

450
00:33:01,414 --> 00:33:02,649
Indy?

451
00:33:03,818 --> 00:33:06,586
Look, you get paid
and then I'll split.

452
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,688
So all I gotta do
is walk in and out?

453
00:33:08,823 --> 00:33:11,225
All you gotta do.
We'll take care of the rest.

454
00:33:11,358 --> 00:33:13,861
Cross my spark and hope to die.

455
00:33:13,995 --> 00:33:16,663
Wow! That was corny
when I said it out loud.

456
00:33:18,199 --> 00:33:21,401
What about the big man?
Optimal, or whatever.

457
00:33:21,535 --> 00:33:23,805
You let me worry about him.

458
00:33:23,938 --> 00:33:24,972
Cool?

459
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,776
Got him!
He's in, baby! Whoo!

460
00:33:56,037 --> 00:33:58,338
Y'all are robots
that transform into cars,

461
00:33:58,471 --> 00:34:00,274
even though
you're from way out in space.

462
00:34:00,407 --> 00:34:03,077
But now there's this key that
opens a portal back to your home?

463
00:34:03,211 --> 00:34:06,413
And you know this because
there's a beacon light in the sky

464
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:08,149
that I can't see
because I'm human.

465
00:34:08,282 --> 00:34:10,818
You say that like it's weird.
It's super weird.

466
00:34:10,952 --> 00:34:13,520
You know what's weird? Marky
Mark is leaving the Funky Bunch!

467
00:34:13,653 --> 00:34:17,390
I heard he's just gonna pursue
acting now. That's crazy! What?

468
00:34:17,524 --> 00:34:19,327
- How does that...
- What a world.

469
00:34:19,459 --> 00:34:20,627
Whatever, man.

470
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,395
I'm just trying
to collect this money

471
00:34:22,529 --> 00:34:25,199
and get your angry-ass boss off
of Earth before he blows a gasket.

472
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:27,001
Don't take it personal.

473
00:34:27,134 --> 00:34:28,668
He just misses home.

474
00:34:28,803 --> 00:34:32,073
And I think he blames himself
for us getting stuck here.

475
00:34:32,206 --> 00:34:34,242
Earth was supposed
to be a pit stop, you know,

476
00:34:34,374 --> 00:34:38,145
a place for us to regroup
and rejoin the war back home.

477
00:34:38,279 --> 00:34:40,815
Prime feels like it's his fault
we've been stranded here,

478
00:34:40,948 --> 00:34:43,017
like he has to fix it
all on his own.

479
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,120
<i>All right, team, heads up.
There's security up ahead.</i>

480
00:34:46,254 --> 00:34:47,387
Nice!

481
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,788
This is gonna be fun, man.

482
00:34:48,923 --> 00:34:50,925
No, no, no. No, bro.
You need to switch it up.

483
00:34:51,058 --> 00:34:54,362
You need to turn into a helicopter
or a speedboat or something.

484
00:34:54,494 --> 00:34:56,831
I got something
way better than that.

485
00:35:10,443 --> 00:35:11,678
Good call.

486
00:35:14,348 --> 00:35:16,150
I do not like this plan.

487
00:35:16,284 --> 00:35:19,419
Yeah, Mirage isn't
really known for being quiet.

488
00:35:19,552 --> 00:35:21,454
At least Mirage is one of us.

489
00:35:21,588 --> 00:35:24,025
We should not be relying
on a human.

490
00:35:24,158 --> 00:35:25,293
<i>They are my friends.</i>

491
00:35:25,425 --> 00:35:27,494
I know one was good to you, Bee,

492
00:35:27,627 --> 00:35:29,429
but this is not our world.

493
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:32,400
The humans will always
protect what is theirs.

494
00:35:32,532 --> 00:35:35,369
We can only trust our own kind.

495
00:35:35,502 --> 00:35:37,637
<i>You can't handle the truth!</i>

496
00:35:37,771 --> 00:35:41,375
I do not want you going to
that drive-in theater anymore.

497
00:36:26,753 --> 00:36:29,323
Nightbird, search the island.

498
00:36:30,191 --> 00:36:34,561
Finally, the hunt
draws to a close.

499
00:37:01,389 --> 00:37:02,622
Hello?

500
00:37:19,373 --> 00:37:20,941
Fudge.

501
00:37:22,642 --> 00:37:23,911
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

502
00:37:27,948 --> 00:37:29,150
Hey, are you okay?
Back up!

503
00:37:29,283 --> 00:37:31,385
Yo, are you okay?
Back up! Back up! Back up!

504
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:33,154
I didn't think anyone
was in here.

505
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,425
That's it.

506
00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:43,364
Who are you?

507
00:37:43,497 --> 00:37:44,932
I'm...

508
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:46,766
the janitor.

509
00:37:48,302 --> 00:37:50,104
Security!

510
00:37:50,237 --> 00:37:53,007
No, no, no! You don't have to
do that! It's not what it looks like.

511
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:56,077
It looks like you're trying
to steal museum property.

512
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:58,179
Okay, it's a little
what it looks like.

513
00:37:59,547 --> 00:38:01,182
Shit.

514
00:38:01,315 --> 00:38:04,485
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, yo, yo! It
doesn't belong to you anyway.

515
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:07,555
- No, no, no!
- Just stop! Just...

516
00:38:07,687 --> 00:38:10,723
Hey, hey! Relax, relax,
and let me explain.

517
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:13,394
It belongs to...

518
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:17,064
to these...

519
00:38:18,866 --> 00:38:23,736
these giant robots from space.

520
00:38:24,271 --> 00:38:25,271
Really?

521
00:38:25,306 --> 00:38:26,807
Look, I'm gonna need that.

522
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:30,377
Damn!

523
00:38:30,511 --> 00:38:32,079
- Damn!
- Hey!

524
00:38:32,213 --> 00:38:34,714
Hey, hey, hey! What's
going on here? Don't move.

525
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:37,251
Man, it's about time
you showed up!

526
00:38:44,225 --> 00:38:45,792
The key.

527
00:39:08,582 --> 00:39:12,419
- You were telling the truth.
- Yeah.

528
00:39:12,553 --> 00:39:14,654
But those ones aren't with me.

529
00:39:18,425 --> 00:39:25,399
Rip the flesh from their bones
and bring me the key.

530
00:39:30,471 --> 00:39:31,704
It's yours.

531
00:39:42,316 --> 00:39:43,783
Guys, we got company!

532
00:39:51,258 --> 00:39:54,094
Autobots, protect the key!

533
00:39:56,363 --> 00:39:57,398
Catch!

534
00:40:07,774 --> 00:40:10,010
<i>Not so fast!</i>

535
00:40:14,281 --> 00:40:17,885
They're flying now?
Who the hell are these guys?

536
00:40:27,695 --> 00:40:29,863
Impossible!

537
00:40:29,997 --> 00:40:32,765
I enjoy that look of confusion

538
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:37,137
when an inferior being
meets a higher power.

539
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,949
What the hell are those things?

540
00:40:49,749 --> 00:40:51,151
Are you okay?

541
00:40:54,188 --> 00:40:56,991
Hey! Stop following me!
I'm not following you!

542
00:40:57,124 --> 00:40:59,293
I'm just escaping
in the same direction.

543
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,601
Um...

544
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:20,040
Run!

545
00:42:20,641 --> 00:42:22,376
Go, go!

546
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:34,321
Run!

547
00:42:34,455 --> 00:42:36,190
Go, go, go, go, go!

548
00:42:44,064 --> 00:42:45,232
Watch out!

549
00:42:46,633 --> 00:42:48,202
Thanks.

550
00:42:54,475 --> 00:42:57,277
Scourge, I have eyes on the key.

551
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:01,348
Prime, I don't think
we can hold these guys...

552
00:43:01,482 --> 00:43:03,117
No!

553
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,618
My God! Put me down!

554
00:43:07,321 --> 00:43:09,957
Whoa, that was so scary.

555
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,959
Cool.
You're still alive.

556
00:43:14,661 --> 00:43:15,896
Get the key!

557
00:43:17,131 --> 00:43:18,499
Noah, get out of here!

558
00:43:19,666 --> 00:43:22,136
Get off me! I hate spiders!

559
00:43:23,971 --> 00:43:27,341
Go, go, go! Don't die,
don't die, don't die, don't die!

560
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:33,046
Go! Get out of here!

561
00:43:39,153 --> 00:43:42,189
Leaving so soon?

562
00:43:42,322 --> 00:43:44,859
Yo! Look out!

563
00:43:49,062 --> 00:43:50,597
The key!

564
00:43:55,702 --> 00:43:58,739
Enough of these games.
I'll get it myself.

565
00:43:58,873 --> 00:44:00,974
<i>Not on my watch.</i>

566
00:44:28,602 --> 00:44:31,705
Aw, don't be frightened, humans.

567
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,242
This'll all be over soon.

568
00:44:38,045 --> 00:44:40,013
And you call yourself a Prime.

569
00:44:40,147 --> 00:44:43,350
Primus would be ashamed.

570
00:44:56,597 --> 00:45:00,634
I'm tired of little things
getting in my way.

571
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:02,368
Bee!

572
00:45:04,004 --> 00:45:05,772
<i>O Captain! My Captain!</i>

573
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,440
No!

574
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,694
Bee.

575
00:45:33,467 --> 00:45:36,470
Now to add a Prime
to my collection.

576
00:45:48,515 --> 00:45:50,217
Maximals.

577
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:53,287
Good.
Maybe we'll get a real fight.

578
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:56,790
No. We got what we came for.

579
00:46:01,695 --> 00:46:03,764
No.

580
00:46:04,631 --> 00:46:08,168
This cannot be.

581
00:46:25,118 --> 00:46:27,387
We must go now. Come with me.

582
00:46:51,712 --> 00:46:56,316
This is my fault.
It should've been me.

583
00:46:57,284 --> 00:46:59,720
I'm sorry for your loss.

584
00:46:59,854 --> 00:47:02,991
No offense, lady,
but who are you again?

585
00:47:03,156 --> 00:47:06,560
My name is Airazor.

586
00:47:06,693 --> 00:47:08,295
I am a Maximal.

587
00:47:08,428 --> 00:47:11,231
A warrior from both
your past and future.

588
00:47:11,365 --> 00:47:14,434
Right. That...
That tracks. Yeah.

589
00:47:14,568 --> 00:47:18,472
We fled our home planet
on the eve of its destruction.

590
00:47:18,605 --> 00:47:22,010
We sought refuge
and hid here on Earth.

591
00:47:22,142 --> 00:47:24,511
Right. So you're a
Maximal. Y'all are Autobots.

592
00:47:24,645 --> 00:47:26,647
What was those things
that attacked us earlier?

593
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:30,550
Terrorcons. Servants
of a dark, hungry god

594
00:47:30,684 --> 00:47:33,888
who feeds on entire worlds
to sustain himself.

595
00:47:34,022 --> 00:47:35,789
Unicron.

596
00:47:35,923 --> 00:47:39,559
So you're saying this thing
Unicron eats planets to survive?

597
00:47:39,693 --> 00:47:43,865
Yes. And he imbues
his servants, like Scourge,

598
00:47:43,998 --> 00:47:49,269
<i>with dark energy, which
makes him all but invincible.</i>

599
00:47:49,403 --> 00:47:52,372
<i>He is entirely beholden
to Unicron.</i>

600
00:47:52,506 --> 00:47:56,911
<i>Through his power,
he possesses Scourge's soul.</i>

601
00:47:57,045 --> 00:47:59,814
Awaken, my dark master.

602
00:48:17,865 --> 00:48:20,101
Rise.

603
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:23,071
My hunger is killing me.

604
00:48:23,203 --> 00:48:24,604
What have you found?

605
00:48:24,738 --> 00:48:26,540
Salvation.

606
00:48:26,673 --> 00:48:31,778
The galaxy will once again
be yours to feast on, my master.

607
00:48:32,847 --> 00:48:35,482
I should've gotten
the key myself.

608
00:48:35,615 --> 00:48:38,152
I should've known better
than to rely on humans.

609
00:48:38,285 --> 00:48:40,420
Yo, hold up.
What, you blaming me?

610
00:48:40,554 --> 00:48:44,391
After you conveniently left out the
part about a planet-eating monster?

611
00:48:44,524 --> 00:48:46,727
Because of you,
Unicron will now use the key

612
00:48:46,861 --> 00:48:49,429
to consume every planet
in the universe!

613
00:48:49,563 --> 00:48:51,498
Including my home world.

614
00:48:51,631 --> 00:48:55,235
He doesn't have the key.
At least not all of it.

615
00:48:55,368 --> 00:48:58,906
You fool!

616
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,375
This is only half the key.
Please!

617
00:49:02,509 --> 00:49:06,713
The Maximals...
They must have split it.

618
00:49:06,848 --> 00:49:08,448
Excuses!

619
00:49:08,582 --> 00:49:11,418
Complete the key, or else
you will wish you had died

620
00:49:11,551 --> 00:49:13,653
<i>with the rest of your planet.</i>

621
00:49:13,787 --> 00:49:17,524
We broke the key into
two pieces for safekeeping,

622
00:49:17,657 --> 00:49:20,327
then splintered
and went into hiding.

623
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:23,497
I do not know
where the other half is.

624
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:28,301
For all I know,
I am the last of our kind.

625
00:49:29,003 --> 00:49:30,370
It's in Peru.

626
00:49:30,504 --> 00:49:31,772
How you know that?

627
00:49:31,906 --> 00:49:33,808
It's the symbols on the stone.

628
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:36,643
They were only ever recorded
in one other place in the world.

629
00:49:36,777 --> 00:49:39,379
The Inca Temple of the Sun
in Cusco.

630
00:49:39,513 --> 00:49:43,117
It's one of the oldest buildings in
the western hemisphere. I'm-I'm...

631
00:49:43,251 --> 00:49:46,020
I'm guessing that
that can't be a coincidence.

632
00:49:46,154 --> 00:49:50,124
If you can track those symbols
to Peru, so can the Terrorcons.

633
00:49:50,258 --> 00:49:51,792
We need to get there
before they do.

634
00:49:51,926 --> 00:49:57,031
And then kill Scourge and take
his piece to complete the key.

635
00:49:57,165 --> 00:49:58,532
Yo. Hold up. Hold up.

636
00:49:58,665 --> 00:50:00,634
You want to find this other key

637
00:50:00,767 --> 00:50:03,703
and deliver it to the guy
that just kicked your asses.

638
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:05,940
The Transwarp Key
is our only way home.

639
00:50:06,073 --> 00:50:09,177
If this dude gets a hold of that
thing, it's game over for Earth!

640
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:11,913
Our families, everybody!

641
00:50:15,482 --> 00:50:16,482
I'm going.

642
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:18,186
Out of the question.

643
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:22,156
No offense, but I'm not
trusting my home to a guy

644
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:23,891
who couldn't even protect his.

645
00:50:25,259 --> 00:50:27,995
This is my planet.
I'm going.

646
00:50:28,129 --> 00:50:29,663
What about you?

647
00:50:32,566 --> 00:50:35,335
Me?
What is your name?

648
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:37,170
Elena.

649
00:50:37,238 --> 00:50:38,605
Elena,

650
00:50:38,738 --> 00:50:41,075
will you lead us to this temple?

651
00:50:44,011 --> 00:50:46,314
Chance to stop
the end of the world.

652
00:50:46,446 --> 00:50:48,149
Actually,

653
00:50:48,282 --> 00:50:50,784
you'll be saving two worlds.

654
00:50:58,159 --> 00:50:59,160
Yeah.

655
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:11,839
<i>Yo, is that you, Sonic?</i>

656
00:51:14,374 --> 00:51:16,077
What are you doing up, Tails?

657
00:51:16,776 --> 00:51:18,578
<i>I can't sleep.</i>

658
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:29,924
This too hot?

659
00:51:31,259 --> 00:51:32,692
You playing that game too much.

660
00:51:32,827 --> 00:51:35,062
Give it a rest,
so your hand can take a break.

661
00:51:35,196 --> 00:51:37,031
I'm gonna beat it.

662
00:51:39,267 --> 00:51:40,467
My money's on you, bro.

663
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,270
We don't quit.

664
00:51:42,402 --> 00:51:44,205
Come on, get some sleep,
all right?

665
00:51:52,113 --> 00:51:53,948
Yo, listen, um,

666
00:51:54,081 --> 00:51:56,416
I gotta...
I gotta head out for a while.

667
00:51:56,549 --> 00:51:58,920
And I don't know
when I'm gonna be back.

668
00:51:59,452 --> 00:52:00,452
Why?

669
00:52:02,356 --> 00:52:05,592
Shit.

670
00:52:10,463 --> 00:52:11,832
- What the...
- No, no, no!

671
00:52:11,966 --> 00:52:14,035
No! Stop, please!
Turn off! Turn off!

672
00:52:14,168 --> 00:52:16,603
Yo, won't you...
I told you to sit tight.

673
00:52:16,736 --> 00:52:18,438
Stop it. I can't
turn it off. I'm sorry.

674
00:52:18,571 --> 00:52:19,572
Is that a robot?

675
00:52:19,706 --> 00:52:21,309
No, no, no.
Go... Go back to bed.

676
00:52:21,441 --> 00:52:24,577
Yo, shut it off! I think your bad
hot-wiring messed up my lights.

677
00:52:24,711 --> 00:52:26,231
I got the bat.
Yo, chill. Give me that.

678
00:52:26,347 --> 00:52:29,150
- Did he say "bat"?
- You're gonna wake up Ma!

679
00:52:34,521 --> 00:52:36,756
I know you're a robot.

680
00:52:38,025 --> 00:52:39,160
Kris?

681
00:52:46,434 --> 00:52:48,970
Yo! You scratched my paint!

682
00:52:49,904 --> 00:52:51,538
What are you doing?

683
00:52:51,671 --> 00:52:53,374
Man, they didn't
treat E.T. like this.

684
00:52:53,506 --> 00:52:54,875
You know this thing?
Yeah.

685
00:52:55,009 --> 00:52:57,544
We're just work friends.

686
00:52:57,677 --> 00:53:00,547
"Work friends"?
You've been inside me.

687
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,418
Look, that thing I told you
I have to go do?

688
00:53:04,551 --> 00:53:05,820
It's for him and his crew.

689
00:53:05,953 --> 00:53:07,593
We're trying to stop
the end of the world.

690
00:53:07,721 --> 00:53:08,788
The world's ending?

691
00:53:08,923 --> 00:53:11,225
No!
Maybe. Sixty-forty.

692
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,828
You know I'm not gonna
let that happen.

693
00:53:13,961 --> 00:53:15,896
But that's why I have to leave.

694
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,901
I'll go get my things.

695
00:53:21,701 --> 00:53:23,270
Tough kid.

696
00:53:23,404 --> 00:53:25,739
What? No. Whoa, whoa. Hold
up. Hold up. You're not coming.

697
00:53:25,873 --> 00:53:30,610
Why? You need someone to watch
your back. It's too dangerous, Kris.

698
00:53:31,711 --> 00:53:34,647
And I need you to stay here
and take care of Mom.

699
00:53:36,716 --> 00:53:38,718
'Cause you might not come back.

700
00:53:52,366 --> 00:53:53,968
Hey, robot.

701
00:53:54,768 --> 00:53:57,371
Me? 'Sup?

702
00:53:57,505 --> 00:54:01,175
Watch out for my brother.
Okay?

703
00:54:01,308 --> 00:54:03,210
You got it, little man.

704
00:54:03,344 --> 00:54:04,979
Nah, I'm serious.

705
00:54:05,112 --> 00:54:07,882
If he gets hurt,
I'm coming after you.

706
00:54:09,483 --> 00:54:12,987
Don't worry.
I got Noah's back. I promise.

707
00:54:17,091 --> 00:54:18,225
Home team?

708
00:54:21,195 --> 00:54:22,229
Home team.

709
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,135
Kid's got heart.

710
00:54:28,269 --> 00:54:30,237
<i>Cojones muy grande.</i>

711
00:54:41,082 --> 00:54:44,051
Wu-Tang is
in the building, baby!

712
00:54:44,185 --> 00:54:46,220
Way to be incognito.

713
00:54:46,353 --> 00:54:49,090
Aw, come on, Prime.
Smile a little bit.

714
00:54:49,223 --> 00:54:51,258
It won't hurt.
Let me see that under bite.

715
00:54:51,392 --> 00:54:54,562
All right. So what kind
of jet we taking to Peru?

716
00:54:54,694 --> 00:54:56,230
Or is it a plane?
Either one's fine.

717
00:54:56,363 --> 00:54:59,200
I just need first class, okay?
'Cause I got long-ass legs.

718
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:00,968
Well, he is a plane.

719
00:55:01,102 --> 00:55:02,769
No. No, no. Don't...

720
00:55:02,903 --> 00:55:04,637
Don't tell me we're flying on...

721
00:55:04,771 --> 00:55:06,173
No.

722
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:28,963
My lads! I am Stratosphere,
lord of the skies!

723
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:38,072
Yeah, I'm walking to Peru.

724
00:55:47,114 --> 00:55:48,149
Ooh.

725
00:55:49,383 --> 00:55:50,417
My gosh.

726
00:55:59,426 --> 00:56:00,760
Sorry.

727
00:56:00,895 --> 00:56:04,231
I sing when I get nervous.
It usually calms me down.

728
00:56:04,365 --> 00:56:05,599
First time flying?

729
00:56:05,732 --> 00:56:08,202
Man, this is my first time
leaving New York.

730
00:56:09,603 --> 00:56:12,173
My God. God.

731
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,475
So the Bronx?

732
00:56:14,608 --> 00:56:16,577
Brooklyn, all right?

733
00:56:16,709 --> 00:56:18,445
East New York all day.

734
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,381
I'm from Bushwick.

735
00:56:20,514 --> 00:56:22,749
Really?

736
00:56:22,883 --> 00:56:25,252
Um, me and my dad,
we used to go to this...

737
00:56:25,386 --> 00:56:27,821
This pizza spot down
on Knickerbocker and Greene.

738
00:56:27,955 --> 00:56:30,723
Tony's Pizza? Wow.

739
00:56:35,095 --> 00:56:37,498
So, tell me about him,
your pops.

740
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,765
What... What was he like?

741
00:56:38,899 --> 00:56:42,702
He was a...
He was a cabbie for 40 years.

742
00:56:42,836 --> 00:56:45,506
Smartest guy you ever met.

743
00:56:45,639 --> 00:56:47,774
He could talk to you
about anything.

744
00:56:47,908 --> 00:56:50,511
History, science, cricket.

745
00:56:50,644 --> 00:56:52,413
Cricket?

746
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,649
And he ain't never
even go to college either.

747
00:56:55,782 --> 00:56:57,685
He used to always say,

748
00:56:57,818 --> 00:57:01,222
"If you keep your eyes
and your ears open,

749
00:57:01,355 --> 00:57:03,991
life will show you
everything you need to know."

750
00:57:06,193 --> 00:57:08,629
So that's why you said yes
to all of this.

751
00:57:09,463 --> 00:57:11,932
I figured if
he is somewhere watching,

752
00:57:12,066 --> 00:57:15,970
then seeing his daughter
do something crazy like this

753
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:18,771
would definitely make him proud.

754
00:57:28,449 --> 00:57:31,185
You really think
this key thing's in Peru?

755
00:57:31,318 --> 00:57:32,519
I... I think so.

756
00:57:32,653 --> 00:57:34,288
The evidence lines up.

757
00:57:36,056 --> 00:57:39,059
Well, if it is,
and we get our hands on it,

758
00:57:39,193 --> 00:57:40,628
then we gotta destroy it.

759
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,529
What?

760
00:57:42,663 --> 00:57:45,833
They can't unite the key
without both pieces.

761
00:57:45,966 --> 00:57:49,803
No key, no Unicron,
no Earth getting eaten.

762
00:57:53,173 --> 00:57:55,342
Yeah, but then
they can't get home.

763
00:57:56,744 --> 00:57:58,379
We gotta think about us.

764
00:58:02,249 --> 00:58:04,285
Look, all you gotta do
is find it.

765
00:58:04,418 --> 00:58:06,487
And I'll take care of the rest.

766
00:58:10,591 --> 00:58:14,695
Do you think an Energon
infusion could bring him back?

767
00:58:14,828 --> 00:58:16,063
Perhaps.

768
00:58:16,897 --> 00:58:19,533
If we could get him
back to Cybertron.

769
00:58:21,201 --> 00:58:24,571
I never should have taken us
so far from home.

770
00:59:06,513 --> 00:59:08,982
Wow! Wheeljack needs to fix
that power steering.

771
00:59:11,985 --> 00:59:13,220
Sorry I'm late.

772
00:59:13,354 --> 00:59:15,122
I was taking in
a harmonious moment

773
00:59:15,255 --> 00:59:18,959
between a serene butterfly
and an unruffled caterpillar.

774
00:59:19,093 --> 00:59:20,561
Such tranquility.

775
00:59:20,694 --> 00:59:24,198
Yo-ho-ho. <i>Oye, papo,</i>
where you from? Cybertron.

776
00:59:24,331 --> 00:59:26,667
So where'd you get that
accent? Accent? What accent?

777
00:59:26,801 --> 00:59:28,969
You know what I'm saying?
I'm just saying it's cool.

778
00:59:29,103 --> 00:59:31,572
Like I was about to be like,<i>"Oh,
hey, daddy,</i> <i>where are you from?"</i>

779
00:59:31,705 --> 00:59:35,509
<i>but</i> I didn't want to assume
that you speak Spanish too,

780
00:59:35,642 --> 00:59:36,877
because then... Right?

781
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:39,546
A little racist, <i>Brother.</i>

782
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,816
I'm not trying to be,
you know... Yo.

783
00:59:41,949 --> 00:59:45,018
But anyway... The mission.
Follow me.

784
00:59:45,152 --> 00:59:47,388
But he's a robot, like, so,

785
00:59:48,088 --> 00:59:49,890
how's that racist?

786
00:59:53,293 --> 00:59:55,162
Okay, you guys, check this out.

787
00:59:55,295 --> 00:59:58,499
The coordinates you gave me
correspond to an old church.

788
00:59:58,632 --> 00:59:59,632
Take a look.

789
01:00:01,969 --> 01:00:05,539
That's Santo Domingo. The Spanish
built it on top of an old Inca temple.

790
01:00:05,672 --> 01:00:09,510
<i>Correcto.</i> I picked up some residual
energy readings around the courtyard,

791
01:00:09,643 --> 01:00:12,212
so I'm guessing
the key's somewhere close by.

792
01:00:12,346 --> 01:00:14,648
But we may have some trouble
getting there.

793
01:00:14,782 --> 01:00:16,116
Inti Raymi.

794
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:18,719
It's a festival that
shuts down the whole city.

795
01:00:18,853 --> 01:00:21,288
- Guess it's a night mission then.
- No.

796
01:00:21,422 --> 01:00:23,557
Scourge could already be here.

797
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:27,294
We must retrieve
the other half before he does.

798
01:00:29,263 --> 01:00:31,498
Me and Elena will do it.

799
01:00:31,632 --> 01:00:33,667
Y'all would never
make it two blocks.

800
01:00:33,802 --> 01:00:36,479
There's human security all around
the church. You'll never get through.

801
01:00:36,503 --> 01:00:39,306
Then we'll have to take
a play out of your book.

802
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,508
We'll hide in plain sight.

803
01:00:41,642 --> 01:00:43,977
We'll blend in with the parade.

804
01:00:44,111 --> 01:00:46,947
It is not a bad idea.

805
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:49,851
We will keep an eye out
for the Terrorcons.

806
01:00:49,983 --> 01:00:53,620
On first sign of trouble,
we are going in.

807
01:00:53,754 --> 01:00:55,155
Yo, Noah, think fast.

808
01:01:01,328 --> 01:01:03,730
And if you need help,
just holler.

809
01:01:19,146 --> 01:01:21,482
I am in position.

810
01:01:21,615 --> 01:01:23,450
All right, coast is clear.

811
01:01:23,584 --> 01:01:26,487
<i>Noah, Elena, it's go time.</i>

812
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:29,490
<i>Blend in. Act natural.</i>

813
01:02:01,923 --> 01:02:04,959
Autobots must be using
their new pets

814
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:07,060
to reach the temple.

815
01:02:07,194 --> 01:02:09,296
Lovely.

816
01:02:09,429 --> 01:02:12,332
They're doing our work for us.

817
01:02:12,466 --> 01:02:14,601
Go fetch.

818
01:02:19,206 --> 01:02:21,441
The key's gotta be
in here somewhere.

819
01:02:22,042 --> 01:02:23,277
Yeah.

820
01:02:36,991 --> 01:02:39,426
That stonework is 17th century.

821
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:42,830
What we're looking for
is something

822
01:02:43,697 --> 01:02:46,567
much, much older.

823
01:02:54,675 --> 01:02:57,578
What is it? It's the
same insignia on Airazor.

824
01:02:58,345 --> 01:03:00,080
But it's not lined up right.

825
01:03:02,951 --> 01:03:04,418
Wait, you see that?

826
01:03:04,551 --> 01:03:09,656
I think there's something
under here.

827
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:15,162
There's another one.

828
01:03:19,266 --> 01:03:20,835
There is.

829
01:03:29,944 --> 01:03:31,211
Now what?

830
01:03:32,346 --> 01:03:34,781
I thought it would've...

831
01:03:48,161 --> 01:03:50,597
That's some
Indiana Jones-type shit.

832
01:03:51,966 --> 01:03:53,700
You sure about this?

833
01:03:54,234 --> 01:03:55,469
No.

834
01:04:04,144 --> 01:04:06,213
Any sign of Scourge?

835
01:04:06,346 --> 01:04:07,681
Nope, all clear here.

836
01:04:07,815 --> 01:04:09,117
Yeah.

837
01:04:09,249 --> 01:04:10,952
It's just groupies over here.

838
01:04:11,085 --> 01:04:13,253
Stay on task, Mirage.

839
01:04:13,387 --> 01:04:16,490
Prime, you gotta learn
how to relax, my man.

840
01:04:38,779 --> 01:04:43,216
You know, we must be the first
people to walk here in half a millennium.

841
01:04:44,651 --> 01:04:47,121
<i>Yo, Sonic. You dead yet?</i>

842
01:04:48,956 --> 01:04:50,058
No.

843
01:04:50,791 --> 01:04:52,960
Wait, did you just
call me Sonic?

844
01:04:53,094 --> 01:04:54,628
I think that's a temple.

845
01:05:01,169 --> 01:05:02,904
What are we looking for?

846
01:05:03,037 --> 01:05:05,173
You see the symbols
on that temple?

847
01:05:05,305 --> 01:05:07,075
They match the ones
in the courtyard.

848
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:08,775
I think it's up there.

849
01:05:20,387 --> 01:05:22,756
I think we found
what we came here for.

850
01:05:25,292 --> 01:05:26,892
I always wondered
what it would feel like

851
01:05:26,994 --> 01:05:29,964
to be there when artifacts
were actually found.

852
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:35,469
All right. Now come on, push.

853
01:05:43,144 --> 01:05:45,146
Are you even pushing?

854
01:05:45,278 --> 01:05:47,280
Yeah, I'm pushing.

855
01:05:58,592 --> 01:06:00,828
Wait, what?
Just... Just let me think.

856
01:06:00,962 --> 01:06:02,629
No, no. Where is it?

857
01:06:02,763 --> 01:06:07,300
Sometimes there's, like, a...
like a false bottom or something.

858
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:11,738
Look.

859
01:06:11,873 --> 01:06:14,674
I think I found something.
You see these symbols?

860
01:06:14,809 --> 01:06:18,146
I've seen markings like this...
the Airazor statue at my museum.

861
01:06:18,278 --> 01:06:20,248
They're new.

862
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:22,549
They're not
on the Transwarp Key.

863
01:06:22,682 --> 01:06:24,584
There's two of them.

864
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,694
Mirage?

865
01:06:38,732 --> 01:06:41,735
Let's keep moving.
Just give me a second.

866
01:06:45,973 --> 01:06:47,241
Run!

867
01:06:54,949 --> 01:06:56,449
Go, go, go, go, go!

868
01:06:56,583 --> 01:06:58,385
Mirage! We got trouble!

869
01:06:58,518 --> 01:07:01,555
<i>One of those things is down
here! Where are you guys?</i>

870
01:07:01,688 --> 01:07:03,790
Hang tight!
I'm on the way.

871
01:07:06,359 --> 01:07:07,694
<i>The Autobots are moving.</i>

872
01:07:07,829 --> 01:07:10,497
They must have found the key.

873
01:07:21,741 --> 01:07:23,044
Come on!

874
01:07:24,477 --> 01:07:25,847
Airazor, where are the humans?

875
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:28,983
They're underground,
heading towards the jungle.

876
01:07:46,167 --> 01:07:48,668
Aw, man, they're tailing us!

877
01:07:58,145 --> 01:08:00,248
Do something!
What do you want me to do?

878
01:08:07,989 --> 01:08:09,957
You had a gun this whole time?

879
01:08:28,009 --> 01:08:30,044
<i>Prime, what the hell
are you doing?</i>

880
01:08:30,177 --> 01:08:33,114
I'm going to take back
Scourge's key

881
01:08:33,247 --> 01:08:36,384
and then take off his head.

882
01:08:47,895 --> 01:08:50,730
Guys!
I could use a little help!

883
01:08:50,865 --> 01:08:53,134
Did someone call for backup?

884
01:09:01,409 --> 01:09:03,010
- Brake, brake, brake!
- What?

885
01:09:03,144 --> 01:09:05,246
Brake!

886
01:09:12,686 --> 01:09:15,622
Yay!

887
01:09:16,556 --> 01:09:18,792
This is for Bee!

888
01:09:30,537 --> 01:09:32,173
Come here.

889
01:09:32,306 --> 01:09:33,740
Hold on!

890
01:09:53,626 --> 01:09:56,097
I love your fire, Prime.

891
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:59,967
But you're going to die
on this speck of dust.

892
01:10:00,101 --> 01:10:04,071
I can think of no better place
to bury you.

893
01:10:31,832 --> 01:10:34,301
I will end you, Scourge.

894
01:10:36,203 --> 01:10:39,606
That is a promise.

895
01:10:39,739 --> 01:10:41,308
They're getting away.

896
01:10:41,442 --> 01:10:43,277
Not this time.

897
01:10:50,117 --> 01:10:52,652
I hear water.

898
01:10:56,457 --> 01:10:57,992
Where are we?

899
01:11:04,198 --> 01:11:05,198
What was that?

900
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:21,082
Who are you?

901
01:11:21,215 --> 01:11:22,983
And why are you hunting
for the key?

902
01:11:23,117 --> 01:11:25,352
Yo, Donkey Kong!
Stay away from my friends!

903
01:11:25,486 --> 01:11:28,456
Mirage? Don't worry.
Your boy's got this.

904
01:11:31,058 --> 01:11:33,894
Stranger danger!
Stranger danger!

905
01:11:34,528 --> 01:11:36,330
Hey, hey, hey!

906
01:11:36,464 --> 01:11:37,664
Not so fa...

907
01:11:42,136 --> 01:11:42,903
Ay, ay, ay.

908
01:11:43,037 --> 01:11:45,906
Hey! Over here,
kitty, kitty.

909
01:11:46,807 --> 01:11:49,609
Stand down!

910
01:11:51,611 --> 01:11:54,882
I won't ask a second time.

911
01:11:59,386 --> 01:12:01,721
No! All of you, stop!

912
01:12:04,558 --> 01:12:06,626
Airazor.
Primal.

913
01:12:06,759 --> 01:12:09,696
I thought you were lost.
All of you.

914
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:12,900
The others... Are they...

915
01:12:13,033 --> 01:12:15,903
I am all that is left.

916
01:12:19,106 --> 01:12:22,510
Prime, these are
my fellow Maximals.

917
01:12:22,642 --> 01:12:24,845
Rhinox.

918
01:12:24,979 --> 01:12:26,514
Cheetor.

919
01:12:26,646 --> 01:12:28,149
Sorry about scaring you,
brother.

920
01:12:28,282 --> 01:12:30,184
- Scared?
- Please.

921
01:12:30,317 --> 01:12:31,819
I'm not scared.

922
01:12:31,952 --> 01:12:33,287
That's just engine oil.

923
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:38,192
And our leader, Optimus Primal.

924
01:12:38,893 --> 01:12:40,793
Optimus Primal?

925
01:12:40,928 --> 01:12:45,266
Named after you, the
legendary warrior of Cybertron.

926
01:12:45,399 --> 01:12:46,733
It's an honor.

927
01:12:47,902 --> 01:12:50,905
Airazor, I'm happy
to see you, old friend.

928
01:12:51,038 --> 01:12:54,041
But bringing others here
was not part of our plan.

929
01:12:54,175 --> 01:12:56,676
I fear you bring dark tidings.

930
01:12:56,810 --> 01:12:58,913
Scourge has come to Earth.

931
01:12:59,046 --> 01:13:00,780
He's found us.

932
01:13:00,915 --> 01:13:03,184
And he has half of the key.

933
01:13:03,317 --> 01:13:06,020
We must find the second
piece before he does.

934
01:13:06,153 --> 01:13:07,955
But it wasn't in the cave.

935
01:13:08,088 --> 01:13:11,192
It was. But we moved it
long ago to keep it safe.

936
01:13:11,325 --> 01:13:13,760
Where is it now?

937
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:18,265
Come with me.

938
01:13:26,307 --> 01:13:28,142
That doesn't look so good.

939
01:13:28,275 --> 01:13:31,912
When Scourge touches you,
he leaves a mark.

940
01:13:32,546 --> 01:13:34,781
But I'll be all right.

941
01:13:47,394 --> 01:13:49,263
Hey, back there
you called me Sonic.

942
01:13:49,396 --> 01:13:51,398
Yeah. Your little bro's
got this thing

943
01:13:51,532 --> 01:13:54,235
about using real names
over the airwaves, so...

944
01:13:54,368 --> 01:13:56,070
Wait, you been talking
to Kris? -

945
01:13:56,203 --> 01:13:59,640
He gave me this
to keep tabs on you,

946
01:13:59,772 --> 01:14:01,242
make sure I'm keeping
my promise.

947
01:14:01,375 --> 01:14:02,710
Here.

948
01:14:02,843 --> 01:14:04,812
Next time,
include warning labels.

949
01:14:04,945 --> 01:14:07,747
Nah, go ahead, keep it.

950
01:14:07,881 --> 01:14:09,650
I guess it does
look better on me.

951
01:14:09,782 --> 01:14:12,553
Just don't ask what part
of my body it came from.

952
01:14:15,522 --> 01:14:17,391
So, who are you?

953
01:14:17,524 --> 01:14:19,493
We Maximals are an advanced race

954
01:14:19,627 --> 01:14:23,897
dedicated to the expansion
of life throughout the universe.

955
01:14:24,031 --> 01:14:27,167
We use the Transwarp Key
to visit young worlds.

956
01:14:27,301 --> 01:14:30,971
The Nazca Lines,
the Temple at Tikal...

957
01:14:31,105 --> 01:14:32,740
That was you guys, right?

958
01:14:32,873 --> 01:14:34,041
Not us.

959
01:14:34,174 --> 01:14:36,477
We cannot claim credit
for human ingenuity.

960
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:40,080
But you had the key.
Why stay on this world?

961
01:14:40,214 --> 01:14:42,516
When Unicron destroyed
our world,

962
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:46,587
we took an oath dedicated
to the preservation of life,

963
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,622
no matter the cost.

964
01:14:48,756 --> 01:14:51,158
And Earth
has been a safe refuge.

11
01:15:19,747 --> 01:15:23,115
<i>I'm happy to see
you, old friend.</i>

12
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:25,527
<i>How are you, brother?</i>

965
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:32,366
This is Amaru.

966
01:15:32,499 --> 01:15:35,469
He and his family are the
last descendants of a tribe

967
01:15:35,602 --> 01:15:38,372
that has watched over us
for hundreds of years.

968
01:15:38,505 --> 01:15:43,410
When we arrived, they
shared their world with us.

969
01:15:43,544 --> 01:15:45,979
And together
we protected its people

970
01:15:46,113 --> 01:15:49,149
and our secret.

971
01:15:55,656 --> 01:15:57,558
You allied with humans.

972
01:15:58,492 --> 01:16:00,227
We did.

973
01:16:01,228 --> 01:16:03,530
If you give us this key,

974
01:16:03,664 --> 01:16:07,668
tomorrow I will light the beacon
and bring Scourge to us.

975
01:16:07,802 --> 01:16:12,272
The Maximals have already sacrificed
one home to protect the universe.

976
01:16:12,406 --> 01:16:14,809
I won't risk losing another.

977
01:16:14,942 --> 01:16:17,878
As a leader,
I know you understand.

978
01:16:42,569 --> 01:16:46,206
He is not the Optimus Prime
I imagined.

979
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:49,410
Well, he has lost so much.

980
01:16:49,543 --> 01:16:51,211
Many more will perish

981
01:16:51,345 --> 01:16:54,348
if the key falls
into the wrong hands.

982
01:16:54,481 --> 01:16:58,185
If you had another chance
to save our home,

983
01:16:58,318 --> 01:17:00,354
would you act any differently?

984
01:17:04,324 --> 01:17:07,561
Optimus, come.
I want to show you something.

985
01:17:12,332 --> 01:17:14,935
Your friend
will find peace here.

986
01:17:16,303 --> 01:17:18,972
This is raw Energon.

987
01:17:19,106 --> 01:17:21,008
The valley is rich with it.

988
01:17:21,141 --> 01:17:23,410
Could this revive Bee?

989
01:17:23,544 --> 01:17:26,980
I'm sorry, but in
this state, it is inert.

990
01:17:27,114 --> 01:17:29,516
It would take a great power
to ignite it.

991
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:32,686
Greater than anything
we have here.

14
01:17:32,687 --> 01:17:34,932
<i> Your circle, you reside in.</i>

992
01:17:35,255 --> 01:17:38,425
I see that you are surprised
we entrust the key to them.

993
01:17:38,559 --> 01:17:40,227
Yes, I am.

994
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:43,096
I've been amongst them
a long time now.

995
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:46,533
There is more to them
than meets the eye.

996
01:17:46,667 --> 01:17:48,635
They are worth saving.

997
01:18:23,337 --> 01:18:25,172
What if we didn't destroy it?

998
01:18:27,074 --> 01:18:32,412
Maybe there's another way
to... to save both our homes.

999
01:18:32,546 --> 01:18:36,016
Elena, I made a lot
of mistakes in my life.

1000
01:18:37,618 --> 01:18:39,253
This is different.

1001
01:18:41,455 --> 01:18:43,457
I can't fail at this.

1002
01:18:44,091 --> 01:18:46,159
I can't let my family down.

1003
01:18:46,293 --> 01:18:49,429
You're just like him.
You know that?

1004
01:18:49,563 --> 01:18:50,731
Who?

1005
01:18:50,865 --> 01:18:52,232
Optimus.

1006
01:18:53,634 --> 01:18:54,969
I'm serious.

1007
01:18:55,102 --> 01:18:58,305
He feels it too.
Feels what?

1008
01:18:58,438 --> 01:19:00,440
Like a beast of burden

1009
01:19:00,574 --> 01:19:04,711
just trying to carry the weight
of the world on his shoulders.

1010
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:09,583
You think he's some...
Some general barking orders,

1011
01:19:09,716 --> 01:19:11,652
but when I look at him,

1012
01:19:11,785 --> 01:19:15,122
all I see is a big brother
trying to protect his family.

1013
01:20:12,446 --> 01:20:14,114
Are you okay?

1014
01:20:20,587 --> 01:20:21,588
Airazor?

1015
01:20:21,722 --> 01:20:25,192
I can feel Scourge!

1016
01:20:25,325 --> 01:20:27,862
- He's...
- in my mind.

1017
01:20:37,304 --> 01:20:40,207
Run, Elena!

1018
01:20:42,776 --> 01:20:43,978
No!

1019
01:20:47,547 --> 01:20:50,651
Airazor.

1020
01:20:50,784 --> 01:20:52,020
They found us.

1021
01:20:52,152 --> 01:20:55,389
Everyone, defensive positions!

1022
01:20:55,522 --> 01:20:57,892
Noah, guard the key.

1023
01:20:58,026 --> 01:21:01,561
Take Elena and find
someplace safe to hide.

1024
01:21:02,997 --> 01:21:04,765
We must protect the humans.

1025
01:21:07,567 --> 01:21:09,137
Miss me?

1026
01:21:09,269 --> 01:21:12,372
Noah, Elena, get out of here!

1027
01:21:28,188 --> 01:21:29,924
We have to destroy it.

1028
01:21:32,126 --> 01:21:33,161
Noah!

1029
01:21:33,293 --> 01:21:34,929
No!

1030
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:37,597
Don't.

1031
01:21:39,766 --> 01:21:43,503
I know you want
to protect your people,

1032
01:21:43,637 --> 01:21:46,339
but if you destroy that key,

1033
01:21:46,473 --> 01:21:49,309
our home will be lost forever.

1034
01:21:49,443 --> 01:21:51,846
We do not have to choose.

1035
01:21:58,452 --> 01:22:00,520
Please, Noah.

1036
01:22:18,806 --> 01:22:20,574
Elena!

1037
01:22:24,846 --> 01:22:25,880
Go!

1038
01:22:47,902 --> 01:22:49,436
Elena!

1039
01:22:54,108 --> 01:22:58,378
Wait, wait.
Didn't I kill you already?

1040
01:22:59,213 --> 01:23:00,680
No!

1041
01:23:00,815 --> 01:23:03,450
I'm the Maximal that's going
to rip out your spark.

1042
01:23:03,583 --> 01:23:06,821
We'll see about that.

1043
01:23:06,954 --> 01:23:07,954
Kill them!

1044
01:23:14,929 --> 01:23:15,929
Airazor, no!

1045
01:23:15,997 --> 01:23:19,000
I can't hold it back...

1046
01:23:19,133 --> 01:23:20,935
much longer.

1047
01:23:21,068 --> 01:23:23,537
Fight it, Airazor.

1048
01:23:24,337 --> 01:23:27,241
Remember our oath, Primal.

1049
01:23:27,374 --> 01:23:29,811
No matter the cost.

1050
01:23:29,944 --> 01:23:33,815
I can't hold it back!
Airazor, no!

1051
01:23:45,392 --> 01:23:46,828
Primal!

1052
01:23:54,168 --> 01:23:57,238
It's okay.

1053
01:23:57,370 --> 01:23:58,940
Do it.

1054
01:24:22,830 --> 01:24:24,531
Primal.

1055
01:24:25,699 --> 01:24:27,767
No matter the cost.

1056
01:24:36,643 --> 01:24:38,578
Elena!
Elena, look at me.

1057
01:24:39,646 --> 01:24:41,048
Are you okay?

1058
01:24:43,683 --> 01:24:45,518
Scourge has the key.

1059
01:25:29,897 --> 01:25:34,768
Awaken, almighty Unicron.
Your time has come.

1060
01:26:37,664 --> 01:26:40,500
I am sorry, Noah.

1061
01:26:40,633 --> 01:26:42,669
You were looking out
for your own.

1062
01:26:45,538 --> 01:26:47,274
I can't even be angry
at you for that.

1063
01:26:47,408 --> 01:26:52,046
On my home world, we believe that
the battle with darkness will continue

1064
01:26:52,179 --> 01:26:54,281
till all are one.

1065
01:26:55,715 --> 01:26:57,650
I lost sight of that.

1066
01:26:57,784 --> 01:27:01,721
You fought for yours
as I fought for mine

1067
01:27:01,856 --> 01:27:05,592
when we should have been
fighting the darkness together.

1068
01:27:08,963 --> 01:27:11,698
Well, I ain't done fighting yet.

1069
01:27:16,037 --> 01:27:18,205
All right, everybody, squad up!

1070
01:27:18,339 --> 01:27:19,739
Bring it in.

1071
01:27:19,874 --> 01:27:21,574
There's got to be a way
to stop this dude.

1072
01:27:21,708 --> 01:27:25,880
It's too late. The Transwarp
has already been activated.

1073
01:27:26,013 --> 01:27:28,681
It has more energy
than a supernova.

1074
01:27:28,816 --> 01:27:31,618
Any interruption
will ignite it like a bomb.

1075
01:27:32,887 --> 01:27:34,455
The only way
to stop this process

1076
01:27:34,587 --> 01:27:37,958
is an access code installed
long ago as a safeguard.

1077
01:27:38,092 --> 01:27:39,559
Okay, what's the code then?

1078
01:27:39,692 --> 01:27:42,163
The code was split
along with the key.

1079
01:27:42,296 --> 01:27:46,534
Sadly, the second half of
that code died with Airazor.

1080
01:27:46,666 --> 01:27:47,968
No, wait, wait, wait.
I got it.

1081
01:27:48,102 --> 01:27:49,736
The one hiding
her half of the key...

1082
01:27:49,870 --> 01:27:51,372
That had markings in it

1083
01:27:51,505 --> 01:27:53,941
just like the ones I found in
the cave where you hid yours.

1084
01:27:54,075 --> 01:27:57,178
Together, they must complete
the access code.

1085
01:27:58,379 --> 01:28:00,214
So we got a chance now, right?

1086
01:28:00,347 --> 01:28:01,648
A slim chance.

1087
01:28:01,781 --> 01:28:03,616
That is all we need

1088
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:06,586
if you will show us the way,
Primal.

1089
01:28:09,223 --> 01:28:11,892
All right.
We need to move quickly.

1090
01:28:12,026 --> 01:28:14,095
We have a small window
before the portal opens

1091
01:28:14,228 --> 01:28:15,963
large enough
for Unicron to enter.

1092
01:28:16,097 --> 01:28:19,200
The bridge is girded
by a series of tunnels.

1093
01:28:19,333 --> 01:28:21,701
They are too small
for Maximals, but...

1094
01:28:21,836 --> 01:28:23,370
But not for humans.

1095
01:28:23,504 --> 01:28:27,174
If Noah and Elena
reach the central antenna,

1096
01:28:27,308 --> 01:28:29,776
they can use the code
to shut it down,

1097
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:32,313
remove the Transwarp Key...

1098
01:28:32,446 --> 01:28:36,317
and close the portal before
Unicron enters our atmosphere.

1099
01:28:36,450 --> 01:28:38,486
But Scourge will be
watching our every move.

1100
01:28:38,618 --> 01:28:41,088
He'll do anything to stop us
from getting the key.

1101
01:28:41,222 --> 01:28:43,457
Then we bring the fight to him.

1102
01:28:43,591 --> 01:28:45,725
Autobots and Maximals

1103
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:48,062
will charge the bridge together

1104
01:28:48,195 --> 01:28:50,763
and lure Scourge
onto the battlefield.

1105
01:28:50,898 --> 01:28:53,666
While me and Elena sneak in
through the back way.

1106
01:28:56,904 --> 01:28:59,306
It sounds like
we're all going to die.

1107
01:29:00,841 --> 01:29:05,479
If we are to die,
then we will die fighting

1108
01:29:05,613 --> 01:29:07,481
all as one.

1109
01:29:19,759 --> 01:29:23,831
This world is yours, master.

1110
01:29:24,465 --> 01:29:26,300
Scourge,

1111
01:29:26,433 --> 01:29:27,902
they're back.

1112
01:29:33,274 --> 01:29:36,977
Prime.

1113
01:29:38,179 --> 01:29:42,349
Protect the key. Don't
let them get to the bridge.

1114
01:30:02,870 --> 01:30:04,205
Maximals!

1115
01:30:04,338 --> 01:30:05,873
Autobots!

1116
01:30:06,006 --> 01:30:07,908
Roll out!

1117
01:30:18,751 --> 01:30:21,855
Rhinox, Cheetor, maximize!

1118
01:30:45,379 --> 01:30:47,214
At least
the foot soldiers took the bait.

1119
01:30:47,348 --> 01:30:49,450
Yeah, but Scourge didn't.
He's guarding the key.

1120
01:30:49,583 --> 01:30:53,587
All right. This should lead to the
bottom of the Transwarp control panel.

1121
01:30:53,721 --> 01:30:57,091
Get the key, get the hell out of
there. What are you gonna do?

1122
01:30:57,224 --> 01:30:59,193
I'm gonna go distract Scourge.

1123
01:30:59,326 --> 01:31:00,995
No, you can't take on
Scourge alone.

1124
01:31:01,128 --> 01:31:04,064
Relax.
I'm Mirage, remember?

1125
01:31:04,465 --> 01:31:05,933
Hey.

1126
01:31:41,135 --> 01:31:43,404
One, two, three!

1127
01:31:43,537 --> 01:31:45,472
Whoomp! There it is! Pow!

1128
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:47,875
We gotta hurry up.

1129
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:56,016
Take cover!

1130
01:31:56,150 --> 01:31:58,919
Someone give me a real fight!

1131
01:32:01,055 --> 01:32:03,924
It's a fight you want?
You got one.

1132
01:32:18,138 --> 01:32:20,874
He was mine.

1133
01:32:21,810 --> 01:32:23,177
Nope!

1134
01:32:23,610 --> 01:32:24,845
Missed me!

1135
01:32:27,247 --> 01:32:29,783
Noah, get to the key.

1136
01:32:29,917 --> 01:32:31,518
Mirage!

1137
01:32:31,652 --> 01:32:33,822
What do we have here?

1138
01:32:33,954 --> 01:32:35,824
Elena, go!

1139
01:32:39,093 --> 01:32:43,997
Brave, but futile.

1140
01:32:46,801 --> 01:32:49,870
Hey! Don't mess with my boy!

1141
01:33:12,493 --> 01:33:13,927
Mirage.

1142
01:33:19,099 --> 01:33:22,403
No one will remember
this pathetic planet.

1143
01:33:23,704 --> 01:33:26,673
And no one will remember you.

1144
01:33:30,911 --> 01:33:32,246
Mirage, what are you doing?

1145
01:33:32,379 --> 01:33:34,515
Keeping my promise.

1146
01:33:34,648 --> 01:33:37,451
Mirage, no!
Come on, you gotta get up!

1147
01:33:37,584 --> 01:33:39,253
It's okay, Noah.

1148
01:33:44,525 --> 01:33:46,126
Home... Home team.

1149
01:33:48,028 --> 01:33:49,563
Home team.

1150
01:33:52,834 --> 01:33:54,601
Mirage!

1151
01:33:57,471 --> 01:33:58,772
Mirage?

1152
01:34:01,041 --> 01:34:03,912
Mirage.

1153
01:34:04,611 --> 01:34:06,647
Kill the other human.

1154
01:34:44,051 --> 01:34:45,719
Unicron.

1155
01:34:45,854 --> 01:34:48,288
You fought bravely.

1156
01:34:48,422 --> 01:34:53,026
But this world is already mine.

1157
01:35:02,069 --> 01:35:03,670
We're too late.

1158
01:35:12,881 --> 01:35:14,581
Yo!
Hey!

1159
01:35:16,617 --> 01:35:21,288
Hey! Look!

1160
01:35:33,634 --> 01:35:36,169
<i>Hey, Knuckles.</i>

1161
01:35:36,303 --> 01:35:39,139
<i>You there? Over.</i>

1162
01:35:39,273 --> 01:35:40,707
<i>Yo, Sonic.</i>

1163
01:35:41,241 --> 01:35:43,410
Kris!
<i>Noah?</i>

1164
01:35:44,044 --> 01:35:45,579
What's going on?

1165
01:35:45,712 --> 01:35:47,080
Where's Mirage?

1166
01:35:47,214 --> 01:35:50,350
He... He's gone.

1167
01:35:50,484 --> 01:35:52,119
<i>Gone?</i>

1168
01:35:54,022 --> 01:35:56,757
No.

1169
01:35:59,192 --> 01:36:00,828
<i>I'm sorry, Kris.</i>

1170
01:36:08,302 --> 01:36:10,237
<i>I'm not gonna win this one.</i>

1171
01:36:10,370 --> 01:36:12,807
But you don't lose, right?

1172
01:36:13,373 --> 01:36:15,108
I wish that were true,

1173
01:36:15,910 --> 01:36:17,144
but I can't.

1174
01:36:23,317 --> 01:36:25,319
<i>Yes, you can.</i>

1175
01:36:26,153 --> 01:36:28,322
No.

1176
01:36:29,891 --> 01:36:32,125
No, man, I'm not you.

1177
01:36:32,259 --> 01:36:33,360
<i>I hate being sick.</i>

1178
01:36:33,493 --> 01:36:34,795
<i>Whenever I wanna give up,</i>

1179
01:36:34,929 --> 01:36:37,664
you're always there
telling me to keep going.

1180
01:36:38,231 --> 01:36:39,633
<i>But now it's my turn.</i>

1181
01:36:39,766 --> 01:36:41,501
Keep going, Noah.

1182
01:36:43,203 --> 01:36:47,641
<i>You think you're a nobody, but
you're the strongest guy I know.</i>

1183
01:36:47,774 --> 01:36:50,611
You guys are so cute.

1184
01:36:51,178 --> 01:36:52,178
Mirage?

1185
01:36:52,245 --> 01:36:53,915
You're alive!

1186
01:36:54,048 --> 01:36:59,519
Yeah, but... I'm gonna
need you to take the wheel.

1187
01:37:10,530 --> 01:37:12,599
<i>You can do this.</i>

1188
01:37:17,137 --> 01:37:18,906
<i>'Cause you're my brother.</i>

1189
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:22,175
Noah Diaz from Wilson Avenue,

1190
01:37:23,310 --> 01:37:25,779
<i>Apartment 2-C,
Brooklyn, New York.</i>

1191
01:37:29,182 --> 01:37:31,485
No names over the airwaves.

1192
01:37:32,020 --> 01:37:33,286
Forget that.

1193
01:37:33,420 --> 01:37:35,188
Let 'em know who you are.

1194
01:37:39,693 --> 01:37:41,062
Yo, Scourge!

1195
01:37:46,266 --> 01:37:47,902
Remember me?

1196
01:38:08,622 --> 01:38:11,826
You think
you can take me on alone?

1197
01:38:14,929 --> 01:38:17,330
He is not alone.

1198
01:39:02,910 --> 01:39:05,046
I'm never
leaving Brooklyn again.

1199
01:39:17,491 --> 01:39:20,594
Energon.

1200
01:39:50,124 --> 01:39:51,658
Prime!

1201
01:39:54,195 --> 01:39:55,428
Noah!

1202
01:40:12,113 --> 01:40:15,448
I'm getting really tired
of you humans.

1203
01:40:48,615 --> 01:40:50,750
Bee!

1204
01:40:55,655 --> 01:40:59,392
You again.
You should've stayed dead!

1205
01:41:21,349 --> 01:41:24,051
<i>I have come here to kick ass.</i>

1206
01:41:24,185 --> 01:41:25,353
Glad to have you back.

1207
01:41:25,485 --> 01:41:27,355
Everyone guard the bridge!

1208
01:41:27,487 --> 01:41:30,324
Elena, shut it down!

1209
01:41:36,563 --> 01:41:38,332
We gotta give her some cover!

1210
01:41:38,465 --> 01:41:40,101
We'll clear the way.

1211
01:41:42,870 --> 01:41:44,571
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1212
01:41:44,704 --> 01:41:48,441
Punch in an access code...
How hard could that be?

1213
01:41:51,778 --> 01:41:53,848
You've gotta be kidding me.

1214
01:41:59,552 --> 01:42:01,923
Just you and me, Scourge.

1215
01:42:06,127 --> 01:42:10,097
Let's end this once and for all.

1216
01:42:10,231 --> 01:42:11,866
Master, the reinforcements!

1217
01:42:33,421 --> 01:42:34,521
All right, I got this.

1218
01:42:34,654 --> 01:42:35,654
Let's go, Bee!

1219
01:42:44,098 --> 01:42:46,566
<i>Say hello to my little friend!</i>

1220
01:43:09,522 --> 01:43:11,025
We gotta hurry!

1221
01:43:11,658 --> 01:43:12,827
Last one.

1222
01:43:13,660 --> 01:43:16,097
Die, you ugly mother...

1223
01:43:52,599 --> 01:43:56,303
You will never see Unicron
take this world.

1224
01:44:03,010 --> 01:44:04,577
You did it!

1225
01:44:04,711 --> 01:44:06,213
Brooklyn, baby!

1226
01:44:06,347 --> 01:44:08,382
No!

1227
01:44:08,883 --> 01:44:11,052
Unicron will prevail!

1228
01:44:11,185 --> 01:44:12,786
Elena!

1229
01:44:16,223 --> 01:44:18,159
I've had enough!

1230
01:44:20,828 --> 01:44:24,764
Time to show you
the real power of the Prime!

1231
01:44:28,502 --> 01:44:31,505
This belongs
to a friend of mine!

1232
01:44:44,617 --> 01:44:45,853
The panel,

1233
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:48,055
it's destroyed.

1234
01:44:48,721 --> 01:44:50,224
I can't stop it.

1235
01:44:51,559 --> 01:44:54,061
Autobots, Maximals,

1236
01:44:54,195 --> 01:44:55,563
retreat to safety.

1237
01:44:55,695 --> 01:44:58,665
I will destroy the key myself.

1238
01:44:58,798 --> 01:45:00,401
Prime! No!

1239
01:45:00,534 --> 01:45:02,103
There's gotta be another way.

1240
01:45:02,236 --> 01:45:04,004
Bee, protect them.

1241
01:45:12,745 --> 01:45:16,749
Your sacrifice becomes our oath.

1242
01:45:17,384 --> 01:45:20,221
Thank you, my friends.

1243
01:45:24,291 --> 01:45:27,461
Bee!

1244
01:45:27,595 --> 01:45:29,530
We can't leave him!

1245
01:45:36,270 --> 01:45:38,405
Everyone, on me!

1246
01:45:50,117 --> 01:45:51,751
Don't, Prime.

1247
01:45:51,886 --> 01:45:55,156
I can give you
everything you want.

1248
01:45:55,289 --> 01:45:56,524
Then die.

1249
01:46:35,162 --> 01:46:36,162
Noah.

1250
01:46:36,230 --> 01:46:37,764
I got you!

1251
01:46:48,741 --> 01:46:51,478
Let me go, Noah.
Save yourself.

1252
01:46:53,581 --> 01:46:56,083
Till all are one.

1253
01:47:16,003 --> 01:47:18,239
Till all are one.

1254
01:47:30,718 --> 01:47:32,119
Punch it, Prime.

1255
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:00,814
Yeah, baby!

1256
01:48:31,545 --> 01:48:33,881
Unicron...
Is he dead?

1257
01:48:34,014 --> 01:48:37,051
Trapped, but not dead.

1258
01:48:37,184 --> 01:48:39,953
Evil can never
be vanquished completely.

1259
01:48:40,788 --> 01:48:42,222
He could return.

1260
01:48:42,356 --> 01:48:44,091
Let him come.

1261
01:48:44,224 --> 01:48:47,328
United, we will destroy him,

1262
01:48:47,461 --> 01:48:49,496
once and for all.

1263
01:48:53,167 --> 01:48:55,436
<i>I am Optimus Prime,</i>

1264
01:48:55,569 --> 01:48:57,504
<i>leader of the Autobots.</i>

1265
01:48:58,205 --> 01:49:00,341
<i>We have lost the Transwarp Key</i>

1266
01:49:00,474 --> 01:49:03,610
<i>and with it
our ability to go home.</i>

1267
01:49:06,747 --> 01:49:09,016
<i>But we have gained an ally</i>

1268
01:49:09,149 --> 01:49:12,486
<i>in our battle against
the forces of evil.</i>

1269
01:49:12,619 --> 01:49:14,788
<i>Forces too powerful</i>

1270
01:49:14,922 --> 01:49:18,292
<i>for any of us
to defeat on our own.</i>

1271
01:49:18,425 --> 01:49:22,863
<i>But together,
we might just have a chance.</i>

1272
01:49:31,872 --> 01:49:34,775
<i>I am Noah Diaz.</i>

1273
01:49:34,908 --> 01:49:37,077
<i>What is there to know about me?</i>

1274
01:49:37,211 --> 01:49:39,613
<i>I was raised out in Brooklyn.</i>

1275
01:49:39,747 --> 01:49:41,882
<i>I got a little bro
who calls me Sonic.</i>

1276
01:49:42,015 --> 01:49:45,352
<i>And if I gotta help save the universe
in order to save the people I love,</i>

1277
01:49:45,486 --> 01:49:47,654
<i>well, then that's what
I'm gonna do.</i>

1278
01:50:18,252 --> 01:50:19,353
How you doing, sir?

1279
01:50:19,486 --> 01:50:21,856
Um, I'm here
for the job interview?

1280
01:50:21,989 --> 01:50:23,090
Noah Diaz.

1281
01:50:23,223 --> 01:50:25,058
I'll tell 'em you're here.

1282
01:50:26,794 --> 01:50:28,495
<i>This Sunday on</i> 60 Minutes,

1283
01:50:28,629 --> 01:50:31,265
<i>I sit down to talk
with Elena Wallace.</i>

1284
01:50:31,398 --> 01:50:36,403
<i>She recently discovered an underground
temple with a network of catacombs...</i>

1285
01:50:36,537 --> 01:50:39,072
<i>dating back to 5000 BC.</i>

1286
01:50:39,206 --> 01:50:43,010
<i>I never could've imagined making
a discovery of this significance.</i>

1287
01:50:43,143 --> 01:50:46,113
<i>So it's definitely
a dream come true.</i>

1288
01:50:47,247 --> 01:50:48,515
Brooklyn, baby.

1289
01:50:48,649 --> 01:50:50,819
They're ready for you.

1290
01:50:50,951 --> 01:50:53,120
Thank you, sir.
Elevator in the back.

1291
01:50:57,826 --> 01:51:00,093
Why don't you tell me
about your strengths?

1292
01:51:00,227 --> 01:51:02,329
In addition to my
experience with electronics,

1293
01:51:02,463 --> 01:51:06,400
I've also been really developing
my team-building skills too.

1294
01:51:07,968 --> 01:51:09,369
Is that so?

1295
01:51:09,503 --> 01:51:12,372
Look, I'm gonna
be honest with you.

1296
01:51:12,506 --> 01:51:14,943
Résumé's a little thin.

1297
01:51:15,075 --> 01:51:17,778
Yeah, well,
I just recently had a job

1298
01:51:18,378 --> 01:51:20,547
working internationally.

1299
01:51:20,681 --> 01:51:22,182
Was that...

1300
01:51:23,984 --> 01:51:26,019
No, I don't think it's on here.

1301
01:51:26,153 --> 01:51:28,823
No, it was...
it was a short-term contract.

1302
01:51:28,957 --> 01:51:31,458
Well, that's cool.

1303
01:51:31,592 --> 01:51:33,527
Why don't you tell me
about that?

1304
01:51:36,663 --> 01:51:40,367
It was in South America.
So I got to work on my Spanish.

1305
01:51:40,501 --> 01:51:41,903
My mom was real happy
about that.

1306
01:51:42,035 --> 01:51:44,338
You know what I'm saying?
You know moms.

1307
01:51:44,471 --> 01:51:47,207
She's just really... But while I
was out there, honestly, man,

1308
01:51:47,341 --> 01:51:50,010
it was really just like
work, work, work, you know?

1309
01:51:50,143 --> 01:51:54,081
That's a shame, because I hear
the food is really good in Peru.

1310
01:51:56,617 --> 01:51:59,086
Wait, I didn't... I didn't
mention anything about Peru.

1311
01:51:59,219 --> 01:52:01,355
Well, that's where
you were, right?

1312
01:52:01,488 --> 01:52:03,925
I was... Down in Cusco?

1313
01:52:04,057 --> 01:52:07,160
With you and, Elena

1314
01:52:07,761 --> 01:52:09,229
and your, um,

1315
01:52:09,363 --> 01:52:11,465
I don't know, call 'em friends?

1316
01:52:14,903 --> 01:52:16,737
What...

1317
01:52:16,871 --> 01:52:18,505
What's going on in here?

1318
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:21,108
We know a lot
about you, Mr. Diaz.

1319
01:52:21,241 --> 01:52:24,578
Who are you?
The CIA or FBI or...

1320
01:52:24,711 --> 01:52:27,815
We are a secret
government organization.

1321
01:52:27,949 --> 01:52:29,416
Strictly off the books.

1322
01:52:29,550 --> 01:52:31,285
We specialize in global threats.

1323
01:52:31,418 --> 01:52:34,288
Planetary loss prevention,
that kind of thing.

1324
01:52:34,421 --> 01:52:37,457
We're in the middle
of an ongoing war,

1325
01:52:37,591 --> 01:52:39,793
and we'd love
to have you join the fight.

1326
01:52:39,928 --> 01:52:41,829
You and your whole team.

1327
01:52:42,563 --> 01:52:43,597
You know,

1328
01:52:44,999 --> 01:52:46,099
the big guys.

1329
01:52:46,233 --> 01:52:48,302
No idea what
you're talking about.

1330
01:52:49,871 --> 01:52:51,572
That's a good answer.

1331
01:52:51,705 --> 01:52:52,941
All right.

1332
01:52:53,073 --> 01:52:55,509
Either way, I want you to know,

1333
01:52:55,642 --> 01:52:57,845
in lieu of the thanks
of a grateful nation,

1334
01:52:57,979 --> 01:53:01,114
we will be taking care of
your brother Kris's health care.

1335
01:53:01,248 --> 01:53:02,316
All of it.

1336
01:53:02,449 --> 01:53:05,053
From now on,
he will have 24/7 access

1337
01:53:05,185 --> 01:53:07,021
to the greatest doctors
in the world.

1338
01:53:07,154 --> 01:53:10,757
And these are doctors who don't ask
their patients about account balances.

1339
01:53:15,796 --> 01:53:16,998
Are you serious?

1340
01:53:17,130 --> 01:53:19,901
You saved the world, kid.
It's the least we can do.

1341
01:53:20,034 --> 01:53:21,668
I don't know what to say.

1342
01:53:21,803 --> 01:53:23,670
We'll work on that.

1343
01:53:25,172 --> 01:53:27,341
Your brother's
gonna be just fine.

1344
01:53:34,448 --> 01:53:36,550
Kris was right, by the way.

1345
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:47,628
No names over the airwaves.

1346
01:53:48,930 --> 01:53:51,498
We could really use
someone like you, Noah.

1347
01:53:51,632 --> 01:53:54,267
Why don't you think about it?

1348
01:54:16,289 --> 01:54:17,791
"G.I. Joe"?

1349
01:54:55,029 --> 01:54:58,699
Come on, baby,
show me some. Show me some.

1350
01:54:58,833 --> 01:55:00,068
That ought a do it.

1351
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:03,704
This?

1352
01:55:03,838 --> 01:55:07,541
This is a complete waste of
your skills and my expertise.

1353
01:55:07,674 --> 01:55:09,476
Think it came out pretty good.

1354
01:55:10,711 --> 01:55:13,181
Well, I guess
we could call it modern art

1355
01:55:13,313 --> 01:55:15,382
and sell it
to some cats in SoHo.

1356
01:55:15,515 --> 01:55:16,783
Nah, I'm not selling.

1357
01:55:16,918 --> 01:55:17,952
What?

1358
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:19,753
Why?

1359
01:55:21,055 --> 01:55:22,756
Is this about the 5-0 thing?

1360
01:55:23,557 --> 01:55:26,027
No. I told you,
I did not ditch you!

1361
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:28,830
I was running the give-and-go.
I thought you knew the play!

1362
01:55:28,963 --> 01:55:32,166
All right, let's say I did ditch
you, even though I didn't.

1363
01:55:32,299 --> 01:55:34,735
For your sake... I see your
face... let's just say I did.

1364
01:55:34,869 --> 01:55:36,904
I think all the blood,
sweat and dead presidents

1365
01:55:37,038 --> 01:55:40,340
I put into getting these car parts
for you make us even Steven.

1366
01:55:40,474 --> 01:55:42,275
It's not that.

1367
01:55:42,409 --> 01:55:44,212
This car is special.

1368
01:55:44,344 --> 01:55:47,614
This car is a jigsaw puzzle
made of garbage!

1369
01:55:47,748 --> 01:55:52,452
Hey, I bet the joint
don't even start.

1370
01:55:54,889 --> 01:55:55,990
Bet?

1371
01:55:57,290 --> 01:55:58,492
Yo, Mirage.

1372
01:56:08,301 --> 01:56:09,469
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1373
01:56:09,603 --> 01:56:12,940
Yeah!
Your boy is back!

1374
01:56:13,074 --> 01:56:15,709
This dude said
I wasn't even gonna start!
