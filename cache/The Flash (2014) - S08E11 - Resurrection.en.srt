165
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,359
but these readings are
10-to-the-negative 28 watts.

166
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:48,992
That's Hawking radiation.

167
00:06:48,995 --> 00:06:50,281
You can only pick up rads like that

168
00:06:50,283 --> 00:06:52,583
from inside a Singularity.

169
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:55,023
Ronnie died in a Singularity...

170
00:06:57,765 --> 00:06:59,723
On our wedding day.

171
00:07:01,198 --> 00:07:02,763
The only way to close it

172
00:07:02,766 --> 00:07:04,679
was to merge the inner
and outer horizons.

173
00:07:04,682 --> 00:07:06,681
Right. Ronnie and Professor Stein

174
00:07:06,684 --> 00:07:09,032
came together, made Firestorm,

175
00:07:09,035 --> 00:07:10,994
then separated in that thing.

176
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:16,869
Ronnie!

177
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:18,133
Professor!

178
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:21,353
No!

179
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:26,792
- Only Ronnie didn't make it.
- Right.

180
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:29,055
But matter cannot be
created or destroyed,

181
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:30,186
only changed,

182
00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:32,526
so maybe Ronnie's still alive.

183
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:35,835
I mean, maybe the pressure
from when the horizons merged

184
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:37,359
broke down his biological matter

185
00:07:37,362 --> 00:07:39,319
into pure thermodynamic energy.

186
00:07:39,322 --> 00:07:41,446
That could account for the radiation,

187
00:07:41,448 --> 00:07:42,581
but it still doesn't explain

188
00:07:42,584 --> 00:07:44,099
why the fire's been killing people,

189
00:07:44,102 --> 00:07:45,456
why it tortured Chester.

190
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:47,451
And if Ronnie knew what he was doing,

191
00:07:47,454 --> 00:07:48,975
he would hate it,

192
00:07:48,977 --> 00:07:51,978
which is why I don't
think he's in control.

193
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,460
When Ronnie died, his
brain was flooded with ACTH.

194
00:07:55,462 --> 00:07:57,375
It's the hormone the human brain creates

195
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,028
when it experiences grief.

196
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,336
So maybe when he was
reborn as a sentient fire,

197
00:08:02,338 --> 00:08:03,807
that same process gave him

198
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,166
an overwhelming attraction
to the same hormone.

199
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:09,125
So he's been eating people's grief

200
00:08:09,127 --> 00:08:11,867
because of some primal urge?

201
00:08:11,869 --> 00:08:13,739
I think he needs it to survive,

202
00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:15,349
which is why he's been
trying to reconnect with me

203
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:16,437
so I can help him.

204
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,831
Did he say anything else?

205
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:20,788
A few words. "Joining, togetherness."

206
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,445
I think he was trying to
get me to remember something.

207
00:08:24,447 --> 00:08:26,316
The Quantum splicer?

208
00:08:26,318 --> 00:08:29,885
It's what made him
Firestorm in the first place.

209
00:08:29,887 --> 00:08:32,975
I think if we can use it
to make Ronnie human again,

210
00:08:32,977 --> 00:08:34,934
his mind will regain control.

211
00:08:34,936 --> 00:08:38,111
And the killings will stop.

212
00:08:38,113 --> 00:08:41,157
Even if you are right about this,

213
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,377
the splicer needs two people to work,

214
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:45,423
and we can't ask anybody to volunteer.

215

- It's too dangerous.
- Yeah.

216
00:08:47,165 --> 00:08:49,035
But we wouldn't need another person

217
00:08:49,037 --> 00:08:51,298
if we use one of Eva
McCulloch's R-CEM chips,

218
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,562
'cause if we fuse one of
Eva's chips to the splicer,

219
00:08:54,564 --> 00:08:56,912
it'll do all the heavy lifting
by duplicating Ronnie cells

220
00:08:56,914 --> 00:08:58,784
and coalescing another
body for him, right?

221

00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:02,483
Okay, but raising the dead,
