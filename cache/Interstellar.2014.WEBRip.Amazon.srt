I've got kids, Professor.

534
00:31:26,754 --> 00:31:28,669
Get out there and save them.

535
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:33,413
Who's "they"?

536
00:31:33,456 --> 00:31:35,937
We started detecting
gravitational anomalies

537
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:37,896
almost 50 years ago.

538
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:39,854
Mostly small distortions
to our instruments

539
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,203
in the upper atmosphere.

540
00:31:41,247 --> 00:31:44,424
In fact, I believe
you encountered one yourself.

541
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:47,122
Yeah, over the Straits.

542
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:49,559
My crash.

543
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:51,257
Something tripped
my fly-by-wire.

544
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,433
Exactly.

545
00:31:53,476 --> 00:31:58,394
But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this.

546
00:31:58,438 --> 00:31:59,569
Out near Saturn,

547
00:32:00,788 --> 00:32:02,616
a disturbance of spacetime.

548
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:06,054
Is that a wormhole?

549
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:08,361
It appeared 48 years ago.

550
00:32:08,404 --> 00:32:10,450
And it leads where?

551
00:32:10,885 --> 00:32:12,452
Another galaxy.

552
00:32:14,236 --> 00:32:16,717
A wormhole's not a naturally
occurring phenomenon.

553
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,284
Someone placed it there.

554
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:20,939
"They"?Mmm-hmm.

555
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:22,941
And whoever they are,

556
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:25,291
they appear to be
looking out for us.

557
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:28,120
That wormhole
lets us travel
to other stars.

558
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:30,209
It came along
right as we needed it.

559
00:32:30,252 --> 00:32:31,819
They've put potentially
habitable worlds

560
00:32:31,862 --> 00:32:33,342
right within our reach.

561
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:35,736
Twelve, in fact,
from our initial probes.

562
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:37,999
You sent probes into that?Mmm-hmm.

563
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:41,220
We sent people into it.
Ten years ago.

564
00:32:42,177 --> 00:32:44,310
The Lazarus missions.

565
00:32:44,353 --> 00:32:45,964
PROFESSOR BRAND:
Twelve possible worlds,

566
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:48,401
12 Ranger launches
carrying

567
00:32:48,444 --> 00:32:51,056
the bravest humans
ever to live,

568
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:53,972
led by the remarkable
Dr. Mann.

569
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:55,408
Each person's landing pod

570
00:32:55,451 --> 00:32:57,323
had enough life support
for two years.

571
00:32:57,366 --> 00:32:59,325
But they could
use hibernation
to stretch that,

572
00:32:59,368 --> 00:33:01,153
making observations
on organics

573
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:02,893
over a decade or more.

574
00:33:02,937 --> 00:33:05,113
Their mission was
to assess their world,

575
00:33:05,157 --> 00:33:06,985
and if it showed potential,

576
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:08,595
then they could
send out a signal,

577
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:11,467
bed down for the long nap,
wait to be rescued.

578
00:33:11,511 --> 00:33:13,426
And what if the world
didn't show promise?

579
00:33:14,644 --> 00:33:16,472
Hence the bravery.

580
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:19,127
You don't have the resources
to visit all 12.

581
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,303
No.

582
00:33:21,347 --> 00:33:24,176
Data transmission back through
the wormhole is rudimentary.

583
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:26,352
Simple binary pings
on an annual basis

584
00:33:26,395 --> 00:33:29,311
give us some clue as to
which worlds have potential.

585
00:33:29,355 --> 00:33:31,574
And one system shows promise.

586
00:33:31,618 --> 00:33:33,794
One. That's a bit of
a long shot, isn't it?

587
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:38,059
One system with
three potential worlds?

588
00:33:38,103 --> 00:33:39,539
[CHUCKLES]
No long shot.

589
00:33:41,758 --> 00:33:42,759
Okay.

590
00:33:43,891 --> 00:33:45,806
So if we find a home,

591
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:50,071
then what?

592
00:33:50,115 --> 00:33:52,595
That's the long shot.

593
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:56,251
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

594
00:33:56,295 --> 00:33:57,861
Did you notice
anything strange

595
00:33:57,905 --> 00:33:59,385
about the launch chamber?

596
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:14,182
COOPER: This entire facility's
a centrifuge.

597
00:34:14,226 --> 00:34:16,837
Some kind of vehicle.
A space station?

598
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,013
PROFESSOR BRAND:
Both. Plan A.

599
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,276
How do you get it
off the ground?

600
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,324
The first gravitational
anomalies changed everything.

601
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:29,893
Suddenly we knew that
harnessing gravity was real.

602
00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:32,418
So I started
working on a theory

603
00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:34,898
and we started
building this station.

604
00:34:34,942 --> 00:34:36,726
But you haven't
solved it yet.

605
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:39,599
That's why
there's Plan B.

606
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:42,167
The problem is gravity.

607
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:45,083
How to get a viable amount of
human life off the planet.

608
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:46,649
This is one way.

609
00:34:46,693 --> 00:34:49,609
Plan B: a population bomb.

610
00:34:49,652 --> 00:34:51,915
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs

611
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:54,092
weighing in at
just under 900 kilos.

612
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,485
Well, how would you raise 'em?

613
00:34:56,529 --> 00:34:59,140
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.

614
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:01,186
After that,
with surrogacy,

615
00:35:01,229 --> 00:35:02,796
the growth
becomes exponential.

616
00:35:03,971 --> 00:35:05,277
Within 30 years,

617
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,148
we could have
a colony of hundreds.

618
00:35:07,192 --> 00:35:09,281
The real difficulty
with colonization

619
00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:11,239
is genetic diversity.

620
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:13,111
This takes care of that.

621
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:14,851
But what about
the people here?
You just...

622
00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:17,376
You give up on 'em?

623
00:35:17,854 --> 00:35:19,117
My kids?

624
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:22,772
That's why Plan A
is a lot more fun.

625
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:26,950
How far have you got?

626
00:35:26,994 --> 00:35:28,169
Almost there.

627
00:35:28,213 --> 00:35:30,432
You're asking me
to hang everything

628
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:33,348
on an almost.

629
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:35,568
I'm asking you to trust me.

And by the time you return,

633
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,361
I will have solved
the problem of gravity.

634
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:49,364
I give you my word.

635
00:36:01,811 --> 00:36:02,943
YOUNG MURPH: Go away!

00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,260

638
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:18,176
Go! If you're leaving,
just go.

639
00:36:21,048 --> 00:36:23,746
DONALD: This world was never
enough for you, was it, Coop?

640
00:36:24,878 --> 00:36:26,401
What, because
heading out there

641
00:36:26,445 --> 00:36:28,403
is what I feel like
I was born to do?

642
00:36:29,361 --> 00:36:31,189
And it excites me?

643
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:34,888
No, that does not
make it wrong.

644
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:36,324
DONALD: It might.

Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

The why of the thing,
that's the foundation.

647
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:44,419
And the foundation's solid.

648
00:36:47,683 --> 00:36:50,251
We farmers,
we sit here every year

649
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:53,080
when the rains fail
and we say,

650
00:36:53,123 --> 00:36:54,342
"Next year."

651
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:56,823
Well, next year
ain't gonna save us,

652
00:36:56,866 --> 00:36:58,477

This world's
a treasure, Donald,

654
00:37:00,914 --> 00:37:03,438
but it's been telling us
to leave for a while now.

655
00:37:08,356 --> 00:37:10,140
Mankind was born on Earth,

656
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:11,925
it was never meant
to die here.

657
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:16,625
Tom will be all right,

658
00:37:16,669 --> 00:37:18,714
but you got to
make things right
with Murph.

659
00:37:18,758 --> 00:37:19,759
I will.

660
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:23,676
Without making promises
you don't know you can keep.

661
00:37:34,426 --> 00:37:36,341
You have to talk to me, Murph.

662
00:37:39,082 --> 00:37:41,433
I need to fix this
before I go.

663
00:37:41,476 --> 00:37:43,913
Then I'll keep it broken
so you have to stay.

664
00:37:46,046 --> 00:37:48,309
After you kids came along,
your mom,

665
00:37:48,353 --> 00:37:50,877
she said something to me
I never quite understood.

666
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:52,835
She said, "Now,

00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:58,928
"we're just here to be
memories for our kids."

668
00:38:04,543 --> 00:38:06,632
And I think now I understand
what she meant.

669
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:11,724
Once you're a parent,

671
00:38:15,554 --> 00:38:17,643
[SNIFFLES] You said
ghosts didn't exist.

672
00:38:24,476 --> 00:38:25,825
That's right, Murph.

673
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,699
Murph, look at me.

674
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:35,835
I can't be
your ghost right now.

00:38:38,011 --> 00:38:39,752

why you can't go.

Okay. Cooper's right.

1083

months to get there.

what if we take a wider orbit
around Gargantua,

02:39:18,157 --> 02:39:19,288
Knock-knock.

2626
02:39:19,332 --> 02:39:20,942
You want 55?

2627
02:39:26,034 --> 02:39:28,210
TARS: Is this really
what it was like?

2628
02:39:30,604 --> 02:39:32,867
It was never this clean,
Slick. [CHUCKLES]

2629
02:39:37,437 --> 02:39:39,091
I don't care much for this

2630
02:39:39,134 --> 02:39:41,572
pretending we're back
where we started.

2631
02:39:43,443 --> 02:39:45,053
I want to know where we are.

2632
02:39:47,360 --> 02:39:48,709
 <i>Where we're going.</i>

2633
02:39:53,061 --> 02:39:55,934
Mr. Cooper.
The family's all in there.

2634
02:39:56,587 --> 02:39:57,631
Family?

2635
02:39:57,675 --> 02:39:59,067
Yeah, they all came out
to see her.

2636
02:39:59,111 --> 02:40:01,722
She's been in cryo-sleep
for almost two years.

2637
02:40:18,304 --> 02:40:19,697
[SOBBING]

2638
02:40:34,712 --> 02:40:37,062
You told 'em I like farming.

2639
02:40:37,105 --> 02:40:38,237
[LAUGHING]

2640
02:40:42,458 --> 02:40:43,895
It was me, Murph.

2641
02:40:47,115 --> 02:40:48,639
I was your ghost.

2642
02:40:50,075 --> 02:40:51,206
I know.

2643
02:40:53,382 --> 02:40:54,949
People didn't believe me.

2644
02:40:54,993 --> 02:40:57,648
They thought that
I was doing it all myself.

2645
02:40:58,300 --> 02:40:59,345
But...

2646
02:41:01,782 --> 02:41:03,784
I knew who it was.

2647
02:41:08,789 --> 02:41:10,791
Nobody believed me.

2648
02:41:11,705 --> 02:41:13,838
But I knew you'd come back.

2649
02:41:16,492 --> 02:41:17,668
How?

2650
02:41:19,582 --> 02:41:22,673
Because my dad promised me.

2651
02:41:28,766 --> 02:41:30,942
Well, I'm here now, Murph.

2652
02:41:32,247 --> 02:41:33,379
I'm here.

2653
02:41:35,163 --> 02:41:36,164
No.

2654
02:41:38,384 --> 02:41:42,170
No parent should have to
watch their own child die.

2655
02:41:45,565 --> 02:41:47,741
I have my kids here
for me now.

2656
02:41:50,613 --> 02:41:52,093
You go.

2657
02:41:55,488 --> 02:41:56,837
Where?

2658
02:42:00,623 --> 02:42:01,973
Brand.

2659
02:42:11,591 --> 02:42:13,201
 <i>She's out there,</i>

2660
02:42:19,164 --> 02:42:21,035
 <i>setting up camp.</i>

2661
02:42:48,149 --> 02:42:49,455
 <i>Alone</i>

2662
02:42:50,978 --> 02:42:53,154
 <i>in a strange galaxy.</i>

2663
02:43:04,339 --> 02:43:09,518
 <i>Maybe right now she's </i>
<i>settling in for the long nap</i>

2664
02:43:27,493 --> 02:43:30,061
 <i>by the light of our new sun</i>

2665
02:43:45,728 --> 02:43:47,513
 <i>in our new home.</i>
