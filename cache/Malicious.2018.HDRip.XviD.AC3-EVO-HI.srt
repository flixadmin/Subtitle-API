You're a genius.

No wonder they hired you
to teach math.

19
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:44,567
I thought it was because
of my incredible charm...

and my devilish handsome,
good looks.

you and let you knock me up.

Wow, would you look at that?

Yeah. And you must be
Mrs. Pierce.

Oh, Mrs. Pierce makes me sound
like my mother-in-law.

Yeah, they give them to all
their students.

Nah, I'm just kidding. It's a...
it's a work study program.

up some of the properties.

happen behind closed doors.

uh, someone sent you a gift.

59

Not anymore.

I think this table alone is
bigger than our old apartment.

68
00:07:08,122 --> 00:07:10,254
It's from your sister.

69
00:07:10,256 --> 00:07:13,590
Do I dare ask how it got here
before we did?

70
00:07:13,592 --> 00:07:15,457
Be nice. I gave her the address.

71
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:18,193

sister, she almost burned...

72

down our apartment with candles
and incense.

00:07:19,764 --> 00:07:22,631
It's a house-warming gift.
She's not so bad.

As long as she doesn't pop out
of here, I'll agree with you.

What about protective?

00:09:02,582 --> 00:09:08,321
And protective. And you're

Math, and life for that matter,

you that just like matter can be
neither created nor destroyed...

330

the same can be true for the
equations here in this class.

They must equal out in the end,

Well, today it's your class,
doctor.

00:52:01,428 --> 00:52:02,962
Alright, then.

557
00:52:02,964 --> 00:52:06,568
The university didn't give me a
house. Let's investigate yours.

558
00:52:08,668 --> 00:52:10,469
Somehow, I feel like this all...

559
00:52:10,471 --> 00:52:12,502
has to do with me losing
the baby.

560
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,404
On a cellular level...

561
00:52:14,406 --> 00:52:16,707
yourself and the baby are still
connected.

562
00:52:16,709 --> 00:52:19,409
It doesn't matter whether you
miscarried or gave birth.

563
00:52:19,411 --> 00:52:21,677
In fact, there are recent
studies that show...

564
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:23,680
that fetal cells from
a pregnancy...

565
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,714
they stay with the mother
for the rest of her life.

566
00:52:25,716 --> 00:52:27,449
What do the cells do?

567
00:52:27,451 --> 00:52:30,550
Well, one theory is that since
they are foreign cells...

568
00:52:30,552 --> 00:52:34,322
they do harm to the mother,
which is why women...

569
00:52:34,324 --> 00:52:38,458
have higher rates of autoimmune
diseases such as lupus.

570
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,826
Oh, that's comforting.

571
00:52:39,828 --> 00:52:41,861
But, there's another theory...

572
00:52:41,863 --> 00:52:44,897
one to which I personally
subscribe and that is...

573
00:52:44,899 --> 00:52:47,898
that the cells actually help
protect the mother...

574
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,634
by assisting in the healing
process.

575

That's why women live longer.

00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:52,787
The Aztecs referred to it
as a fertility box...

658
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:57,990
because only a pregnant woman
is capable of opening it.

659
00:59:57,992 --> 01:00:01,893
The box itself, it's not evil.

660
01:00:01,895 --> 01:00:04,663
It's more like a prison...

661
01:00:04,665 --> 01:00:08,233
to keep a malicious entity
trapped inside.

662

So we're very fortunate,
professor...

663
01:00:10,037 --> 01:00:11,935
that when you decided to throw
it away...

664
01:00:11,937 --> 01:00:13,703
you did so from your front
porch...

665
01:00:13,705 --> 01:00:17,141
rather than the middle of the
ocean somewhere.

666

And now, we have to get whatever
it is that got out, back in.

How do we do that?

668

it is, what it wants.

Harper claimed...

that a fertility box that caused
his wife Emily's miscarriage...

Mrs. Pierce, Emily Harper is
dead.

681
01:01:05,982 --> 01:01:09,183
Her husband, James, killed her
two years ago.

That's not possible.
I-I saw her, I spoke to her.

Maybe it was somebody
that looked like her.

685
01:01:17,792 --> 01:01:20,493
No, it was her. I'm sure of it.

Believe me, that's a day
I'll never forget.

It was the only way to save
her... and our little baby.

966
01:26:22,545 --> 01:26:25,611
And you really believe that?

967
01:26:25,613 --> 01:26:28,314
A wise person once said that
one plus one...

968
01:26:28,316 --> 01:26:29,518
doesn't always equal two.

969
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:39,590
What, what happened to the box,
Adam?

970
01:26:39,592 --> 01:26:43,995

972
01:26:47,366 --> 01:26:50,766

973
01:26:50,768 --> 01:26:53,504
I sent it back to where
it came from.
