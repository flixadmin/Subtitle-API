
1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,917
There are many stories of chivalry

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,333
where the heroic knight
saves the damsel in distress.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This is not one of them.

4
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,083
There it is.

5
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,333
Form up!

6
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:13,417
Let's kill the beast.

7
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,917
For glory! Hyah!

8
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
Be on guard.

9
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:13,375
Form the line!

10
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Hold!

11
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:46,792
The last I could find.

12
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,958
Did you take the tapestries
into town like Father asked?

13
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:51,375
This morning.

14
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,583
We should take the furs too,
and the drapes.

15
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:55,583
Not the drapes!

16
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:57,958
You hate that pattern in your room anyway.

17
00:03:58,042 --> 00:03:59,667
They serve a purpose.

18
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,583
Floria, our people are freezing.

19
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:03,667
And starving.

20
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,833
Who'd come this far north?

21
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:22,167
Elodie, why are they leaving?

22
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,375
There's nothing left
for them here, Floria.

23
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,917
I don't have enough.
Please, I'm hungry.

24
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,458
For food, join the line!

25
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:34,583
- Keep to one side.
- I'm starving.

26
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,125
All right then.

27
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,750
Get off! It's mine!

28
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,875
- Hey! Give me back my food.
- Get off of me, old man!

29
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,042
You've had enough!

30
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,333
Share this with your sister.
Go on.

31
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:47,792
- Could you see who it was?
- A stranger, my lady.

32
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,125
They may take
whatever wood they can carry.

33
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,667
- I'll see to it.
- Come on, Flor.

34
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,167
- Move on.
- Yes.

35
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,730
- Get in line.
- Give it to me.

36
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,708
- I want to meet her first.
- Father?

37
00:05:01,917 --> 00:05:03,292
You must be Elodie.

38
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:04,875
I am.

39
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:19,917
She will do.

40
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,583
- We await your decision.
- Thank you, Your Holiness.

41
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,375
Please, this way.

42
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:37,292
Father, what's happening?

43
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,375
Who is that?

44
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,208
Stepmother?

45
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,792
Well, what is it?

46
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:49,333
From the Queen of Aurea.

47
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:54,167
A proposal.

48
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,292
- Oh, my goodness.
- Huh...

49
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,542
- I have made a match.
- May I?

50
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,833
Uh-huh.

51
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,083
He is a prince.

52
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:04,917
A prince?

53
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:08,917
I know you've always wished to travel,
as did your mother.

54
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,167
Go. See the world.

55
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:16,333
This man, he has a fleet of ships,
carriages full of gold.

56
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:18,708
That's no reason to marry.

57
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,083
We need this.

58
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,958
Our stores are empty.

59
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:26,083
We will not make it to the thaw.

60
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,625
Your people need you.

61
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,333
Hey.

62
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,250
This is who we are.

63
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,042
Get to the port side.

64
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:51,833
Port side.

65
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,667
Elodie, what's the matter?

66
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:01,583
Nothing.

67
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,458
Father says it's natural to be nervous

68
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:08,708
about meeting
your new husband and his family.

69
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,833
They're strangers.

70
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:15,042
I've never heard of the Kingdom of Aurea
until Father sprang this on me.

71
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,292
Mind the lines.

72
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:17,833
Oh!

73
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:22,375
Are you crazy?
What are you two doing up there?

74
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,083
Come down here.

75
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,208
Come on.

76
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,875
This is how you
want your prince to meet you?

77
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,000
Scared, cold as a corpse.

78
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,250
Nose all drippy and wet.

79
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,708
What have I been
telling you this entire trip?

80
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,625
- First impressions are everything.
- Hmm.

81
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,042
Come on, lift up.

82
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,167
Look at that.

83
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,792
I have good news, girls.

84
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:12,125
The captain informs me
we approach Aurea's coastline.

85
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,125
It should be any time now.

86
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,333
Father.

87
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,917
What in the world?

88
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,333
Looks almost... almost like a--

89
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:37,500
A dragon.

90
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:09,333
It's okay.

91
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,750
Oh, my heavens.

92
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,000
It's magnificent.

93
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,542
My lords, my ladies,

94
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,167
be welcome to the Kingdom of Aurea.

95
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,000
The royal family is at prayer,

96
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,250
but word has been sent of your arrival.

97
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,083
In the meantime,
your rooms have been made ready.

98
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,042
If you will follow me.

99
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,375
Is this a dream?

100
00:10:57,292 --> 00:11:00,333
If so, can I move in and never wake up?

101
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,958
If you want these people
to think we belong here,

102
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:08,208
you can't act so easily impressed.

103
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,042
What do you think, Ellie?
Hmm?

104
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:14,125
I think I had
a rather limited definition of wealthy.

105
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,500
I pray this is to your liking, my lady.

106
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,167
A bath has been drawn

107
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,958
and supper has been carried hence.

108
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,583
At first light,
I shall return to convey you

109
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,708
to meet His Royal Highness.

110
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:53,292
Henry, Prince of Aurea.

111
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:57,500
Floria, stop touching everything.

112
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:01,833
Is something wrong?

113
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,292
- I just hope he's kind.
- Hmm.

114
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,542
- And well-read.
- Yeah.

115
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,125
Handsome.

116
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,375
Let's all give Elodie some privacy.

117
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,750
She can use the time
to settle in, as we all could.

118
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,042
Oh, indeed.

119
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:19,958
Come.

120
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:16,417
M'lady.

121
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,708
Everyone's waiting.

122
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:32,542
Ellie?

123
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,667
I can't sleep.

124
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:44,417
I still can't believe
you're going to live here from now on.

125
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,458
You and me both.

126
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,167
I keep thinking,
if only Mother were alive,

127
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,625
I could just
talk to her about all of this.

128
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,208
Perhaps you could talk to Stepmother.

129
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,375
She means well, even if she is a bit...

130
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,167
Exhausting?

131
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:09,375
It'll be fine.
You'll see.

132
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:13,417
You're Elodie.
You can do anything.

133
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
What is your greatest strength?

134
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,042
I always tell the truth, Your Majesty.

135
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,750
Some might call that a weakness.

136
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:28,208
Do you know your heart?

137
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,875
I believe I do, Your Majesty.

138
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,083
And what is it telling you now?

139
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:37,167
In truth, it is beating too loudly for me
to hear much of anything, Your Majesty.

140
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,667
Arise, Elodie.

141
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,042
I'm Henry.

142
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,458
Very pleased to finally meet you, my lady.

143
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,458
We all are.

144
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,083
My son understates our joy.

145
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,167
And if I may say so,

146
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,333
your father has understated your beauty.

147
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:07,542
I've never known my father to understate
much of anything, Your Majesty.

148
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,708
I see she arrives with some wit.

149
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:13,125
Should you want it or not, Your Majesty.

150
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,667
And you must be Floria.

151
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,708
It seems even a harsh clime
can grow the fairest flowers.

152
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:21,625
I love your castle.

153
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,083
I mean, I really love it.

154
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:25,167
Like, a lot...

155
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,083
Your Majesty.

156
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
You are to make yourself at home, child.

157
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:35,250
We elders have some trivial matters
like weddings to attend to.

158
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,333
Yes...

159
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:40,333
Your correspondence
made mention of some particulars

160
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,458
you wish to discuss in person.

161
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,375
- The two of us can confer in private.
- Yes.

162
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,667
It's nothing to bore
our young people with.

163
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,000
They have a far more
important task at hand.

164
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:54,000
They must get to know each other.

165
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:09,167
Do you have any questions of me?

166
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,417
Questions of what subject?

167
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,500
You may choose the subject.

168
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,750
What do you think about me?

169
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,250
Pardon?

170
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,667
Well, you seem disinterested at best,
which is your prerogative,

171
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,458
but I'd like to know if the person
I'm being guilted into marrying

172
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:29,917
truly likes me or not.

173
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,583
If my attitude offends you,
I do apologize. It was not my intent.

174
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:43,792
However, I was unaware that, um,
you were being guilted into anything.

175
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:49,958
The land where I come from
is exactly how your mother explained.

176
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:53,167
Harsh and barren.

177
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:56,125
This union will save us.

178
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,750
I've made my peace with it.

179
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:02,042
My happiness is a small price to pay
for the future of my people.

180
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:06,833
Is something wrong?

181
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:10,417
It's just...

182
00:18:11,917 --> 00:18:15,792
In the letter you sent in advance
of your arrival, you sounded different.

183
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,583
Different. In what way?

184
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:20,667
Far more, um...

185
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:23,833
flowery.

186
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:29,500
Maybe that's because
my stepmother dictated most of it

187
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:33,000
and my sister's idea was the heart...

188
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,500
- The heart.
- Mmm.

189
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,083
I thought it was
some sort of provincial insignia.

190
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,750
You actually drew this?

191
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,125
Hold on.
It's a maze, isn't it?

192
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,083
"I hope you'll get to know my heart."

193
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:51,667
That is very clever.

194
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,167
I used to make them
for Floria when she was little.

195
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,625
- May I ask you another question?
- Certainly.

196
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,375
Do they always follow you so closely?

197
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:06,250
This is them giving me space.

198
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:08,917
That must be tiring.

199
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:11,500
It is, actually.

200
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:17,583
I saw some horses
being left unattended at the stables.

201
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,500
Do you ride?

202
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:40,625
Hyah!

203
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,458
- Where did you learn to ride like that?
- My mother.

204
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,167
Which way now?

205
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,333
Well, depends on what you want to see.

206
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:02,292
Everything.

207
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:04,625
Very well.

208
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:21,792
What happened in there?

209
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Speak already.

210
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:28,208
- Is the wedding still on?
- Aye.

211
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:31,625
You settled on a fair bride price?

212
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,167
More gold than I could ever imagine.

213
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:40,333
Then why do you look so?

214
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:42,000
No, it's nothing.
I'm fine.

215
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,542
Tell me, you didn't say anything
to embarrass us.

216
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,083
No, I did not.

217
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:52,000
Because it's very important
that our two families get along.

218
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,292
Not only for Elodie's sake, but for ours.

219
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,917
I said, nothing!
Nothing's wrong.

220
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:04,375
I saw something,
high on the mountain last night.

221
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Torches.

222
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:09,208
You saw that?

223
00:21:09,292 --> 00:21:10,458
I couldn't sleep.

224
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,167
It was an ancient ceremony.

225
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,042
Or rather, one of three.

226
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,583
They're very significant to my family.

227
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,292
For our whole kingdom, really.
They, um...

228
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,667
They honor our ancestors.

229
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:30,375
That's why my mother
chose these dates for our wedding.

230
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,750
It is quite beautiful.

231
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,875
Yes, I suppose.

232
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:38,458
I really don't have
anything else to compare it to.

233
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,167
May I confide in you something?

234
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,125
Yes.

235
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:45,833
My greatest wish is to go see the world.

236
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:50,625
Really set out and see it, you know?

237
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:52,417
I do, actually.

238
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:54,875
It's my life's dream.

239
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:01,750
For as long as I can remember,
I've longed to explore the distant lands.

240
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,250
The ones you only read about.

241
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,208
Perhaps, one day, we will.

242
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,333
Perhaps.

243
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:29,500
And the orange in this area.

244
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:36,042
Everything's so beautiful, Your Majesty.

245
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,708
Well, I'm glad you approve.

246
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:40,167
Very elegant.

247
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,792
You have impeccable taste.

248
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:49,375
Everything is just so exquisite.

249
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:52,208
I'm sorry, is there something
I can help you with?

250
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:55,792
I just thought
we might become better acquainted,

251
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,750
seeing as we're about to be family.

252
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:02,375
Ah, this must be very exciting for you.

253
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:05,458
Your father was a rope maker, was he not?

254
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:07,250
The finest in the city.

255
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:10,000
And here you are.
You've climbed so high.

256
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:14,042
Still, one mustn't forget one's station.

257
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,917
Nor place undue import

258
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,750
on what is ultimately
a transaction born of necessity.

259
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,042
Uh... "Necessity"?

260
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,250
Well, your family needs money.

261
00:23:26,917 --> 00:23:28,500
My family needs a bride.

262
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,833
What we don't need is more family.

263
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,625
I wish all the best for Henry and Eloise.

264
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:37,042
- I merely--
- Elodie.

265
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:38,542
Pardon?

266
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:43,458
My stepdaughter.
Her name is Elodie.

267
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,042
That's what I said.

268
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,333
Good day, Lady Bayford.

269
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:06,458
It's perfect.

270
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:08,875
Everything in here is so perfect.

271
00:24:13,167 --> 00:24:14,167
Stepmother.

272
00:24:15,917 --> 00:24:17,292
Is something the matter?

273
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,750
Elodie,

274
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,083
I know we haven't always been close,

275
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:25,833
but I need you to listen to me now.

276
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:29,667
This wedding... is a mistake.

277
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,750
What?

278
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:34,500
I don't understand.

279
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:37,000
These people, I don't trust them.

280
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:41,083
It's hard to explain,
but a mother knows these things.

281
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:43,292
Only yesterday,
you were enamored by this place.

282
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:44,375
Floria.

283
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:45,500
I was wrong.

284
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:50,792
They may be royalty,
but that doesn't make them good people.

285
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:53,208
Well...

286
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:57,250
- What does Father think?
- He refuses to talk about it.

287
00:24:57,333 --> 00:25:01,500
And when I try to tell him my worries,
he snaps at me.

288
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,292
- Because you're being unreasonable.
- That's enough, Flor.

289
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:10,042
Elodie, I swear that I only want
what's best for you.

290
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,042
Am I interrupting something?

291
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,792
No.

292
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:21,708
Just...

293
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,042
girl talk.

294
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:30,458
Well, tomorrow's a big day,
and these girls, they need their rest.

295
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:36,167
Think about what I said.
There's still time.

296
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,750
Time for what?

297
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:47,083
I hope you know
what you're doing.

298
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:53,958
Good night, my angels.

299
00:25:55,042 --> 00:25:56,750
- Good night, Father.
- Good night, Father.

300
00:25:58,958 --> 00:25:59,958
Good night.

301
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,250
Wow.

302
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:12,625
You may kiss the bride.

303
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:33,500
I present my son and new daughter,
Elodie, Princess of Aurea.

304
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:59,208
Goodbye, Father.

305
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:24,875
I hope I'm half as beautiful
someday as you are today.

306
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:28,292
Twice as beautiful.

307
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:33,333
- I love you.
- I love you.

308
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:53,792
Hey! Hey, hey!

309
00:29:57,917 --> 00:29:59,167
Where are we going?

310
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:02,458
Remember I told you about those
ancient ceremonies up on the mountain?

311
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:03,375
Yes.

312
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:06,375
We're going to pay homage
to my ancestors.

313
00:31:00,042 --> 00:31:01,708
Welcome, Princess.

314
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:06,125
For generations,
it has been our task, our duty,

315
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,542
to protect our people.

316
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:13,125
The price is dear, but so too the reward.

317
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:15,500
So, tonight,

318
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:22,083
you join a long line of women
who have helped to build this kingdom.

319
00:31:26,042 --> 00:31:29,000
When our ancestors
first lay claim to this island,

320
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:32,250
they found they were not
its sole inhabitants.

321
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:35,500
A creature dwelt here first.

322
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:38,125
The last of its kind.

323
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,250
With savage bloodlust,

324
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:44,792
the beast left its lair
and set upon the village.

325
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:50,208
So the king gathered his soldiers
to avenge his people.

326
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:53,417
But their steel
was no match for the monster,

327
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:56,833
and each man met his end.

328
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:00,083
Each save one.

329
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,542
For the king,
the beast had a far worse fate in store.

330
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:10,208
Give up his three beloved daughters
and the island could be shared.

331
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,667
A cruel torture.

332
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:14,833
He adored his daughters,

333
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:19,083
but his duty to his subjects was stronger.

334
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:22,542
And so, a pact was made.

335
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:26,000
The three princesses met their end
in the belly of the beast,

336
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:27,667
and a kingdom was born.

337
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:38,958
It is this sacrifice
we commemorate every generation.

338
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:41,458
A tradition going back centuries.

339
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:54,125
Your hand, child.

340
00:33:02,167 --> 00:33:07,750
A legacy of honor and duty
you now inherit, Princess Elodie of Aurea.

341
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:24,500
Let our two lines mingle
and fast become one.

342
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:28,417
She is now of royal blood.

343
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,625
To ensure that our kingdom
thrives forevermore,

344
00:33:44,292 --> 00:33:45,833
pay your due to the realm.

345
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:50,250
Toss the coin into the chasm.

346
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:05,083
The ceremony is now complete.

347
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:08,958
You may make your return.

348
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,625
I'm supposed to carry you back.

349
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:16,708
I'm fine with walking, really.

350
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:23,917
Floria would love this part.

351
00:34:25,917 --> 00:34:26,958
Close your eyes.

352
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:29,167
I've got you.

353
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:54,667
I'm sorry.

354
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,833
No!

355
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:04,667
Help me!

356
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:22,333
Help!

357
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,542
Is anyone there?!

358
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:32,042
That's not mine.

359
00:37:34,042 --> 00:37:35,708
I am the sacrifice.

360
00:37:37,042 --> 00:37:38,625
I am the sacrifice?

361
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:14,750
You poor thing.

362
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:17,083
What happened to you?

363
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,542
Give me strength, Mother.

364
00:40:28,417 --> 00:40:29,750
Mother?

365
00:41:25,792 --> 00:41:29,167
Your name, little bird?

366
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:33,375
Speak your name.

367
00:41:35,167 --> 00:41:36,250
Elodie.

368
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:40,375
El-o-die.

369
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,417
Exciting.

370
00:41:45,292 --> 00:41:46,458
What do you want?

371
00:41:49,958 --> 00:41:54,375
I want... what is promised.

372
00:41:57,042 --> 00:41:58,917
What is owed.

373
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:07,083
Every generation, your kind must pay.

374
00:42:10,542 --> 00:42:11,792
My kind?

375
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:15,208
The scent of royalty betrays you.

376
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,292
It's in your blood.

377
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:38,667
Now, my favorite part.

378
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:44,417
Run.

379
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:12,917
Did I hurt you?

380
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,500
Quiet now?

381
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:23,500
A clever one.

382
00:44:24,667 --> 00:44:27,583
The last one was over so quick.

383
00:45:02,917 --> 00:45:04,083
No.

384
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:31,000
Mother wanted you to fight.

385
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:49,917
No. No.

386
00:49:01,542 --> 00:49:03,083
He is a prince.

387
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:07,000
They must get to know each other.

388
00:49:10,417 --> 00:49:12,833
My greatest wish
is to go see the world.

389
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,833
Perhaps, one day we will.

390
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:19,083
One for the dress.

391
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,542
Don't worry.

392
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,333
I won't hurt you.

393
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:32,500
Almost caught you, little bird.

394
00:53:36,875 --> 00:53:41,708
You hide now, like all the others.

395
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,875
It makes no difference.

396
00:53:54,792 --> 00:53:59,333
This story always ends the same.

397
00:54:33,167 --> 00:54:34,167
V.

398
00:54:35,875 --> 00:54:37,250
Victoria.

399
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:41,833
Beatrice.

400
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:43,875
Artemis.

401
00:54:44,708 --> 00:54:45,708
Genevive.

402
00:54:46,667 --> 00:54:47,667
Fatima.

403
00:54:48,625 --> 00:54:49,750
Carlotta.

404
00:54:53,292 --> 00:54:54,458
How many?

405
00:54:59,625 --> 00:55:01,167
Did anyone make it out?

406
00:56:01,667 --> 00:56:03,667
Please, don't.

407
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,625
Somebody...

408
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:48,208
It's a lie.

409
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:04,167
Get off.

410
00:57:50,708 --> 00:57:52,167
I'm deeply sorry...

411
00:57:54,083 --> 00:57:55,875
for underestimating you.

412
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,667
A map.

413
00:58:04,125 --> 00:58:06,583
Now, where am I?

414
00:58:09,167 --> 00:58:10,167
A tree.

415
00:58:11,917 --> 00:58:13,125
The entrance cave.

416
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:20,708
Following down into the bird cave.

417
00:58:24,458 --> 00:58:25,833
Through the twisted tunnel...

418
00:58:28,167 --> 00:58:29,667
reaching water.

419
00:58:31,167 --> 00:58:33,250
The glowworm cave.

420
00:58:34,583 --> 00:58:35,917
Keep following down.

421
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:39,458
I am here.

422
00:58:42,167 --> 00:58:43,458
How do I escape?

423
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:48,833
Is this it?

424
00:58:50,125 --> 00:58:52,000
Did a princess make it out?

425
00:58:56,875 --> 00:58:59,708
Three ways.
Take the middle fork.

426
00:59:00,792 --> 00:59:01,833
Music note.

427
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:04,333
Crystals.

428
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:07,833
Go on.

429
00:59:08,667 --> 00:59:12,083
And then... I am free.

430
00:59:27,292 --> 00:59:28,583
The middle fork.

431
01:00:05,417 --> 01:00:06,417
Music.

432
01:00:36,458 --> 01:00:37,625
Crystals.

433
01:00:51,417 --> 01:00:52,500
This is it.

434
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:07,333
Wish me luck.

435
01:01:19,792 --> 01:01:21,083
You made it out.

436
01:02:47,417 --> 01:02:48,625
No!

437
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:04,583
Elodie.

438
01:03:06,625 --> 01:03:09,208
Fly, little bird.

439
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Hello.

440
01:05:12,042 --> 01:05:13,167
Hello!

441
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:18,583
I'm here!
Help!

442
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:21,833
Help!

443
01:05:22,542 --> 01:05:24,542
Hello!

444
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:35,958
There is no way out, Princess.

445
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:39,625
Not for any of you.

446
01:05:42,208 --> 01:05:43,917
Three were taken.

447
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:47,417
Three must be given.

448
01:05:53,375 --> 01:05:54,750
Elodie!

449
01:05:56,958 --> 01:05:58,208
What's this?

450
01:06:09,208 --> 01:06:10,917
Elodie!

451
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:24,208
Elodie!

452
01:06:31,125 --> 01:06:32,125
Move on.

453
01:06:35,083 --> 01:06:37,958
I've done what you paid for, milord.
I'll just wait up top.

454
01:06:38,042 --> 01:06:39,708
You'll do no such thing.

455
01:06:41,083 --> 01:06:42,958
I hired you to guide us to her.

456
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:47,375
No one leaves here without my daughter.

457
01:06:59,917 --> 01:07:01,708
Elodie!

458
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:04,917
Elodie!

459
01:07:41,292 --> 01:07:43,750
A creature dwelt here first.

460
01:07:45,917 --> 01:07:47,542
The last of its kind.

461
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:51,000
It's a lie.

462
01:07:55,708 --> 01:07:56,833
Three taken.

463
01:08:15,792 --> 01:08:17,125
Slay the vile young.

464
01:08:35,375 --> 01:08:36,667
Form the line!

465
01:08:52,833 --> 01:08:55,083
Please, spare me.

466
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:57,917
Show mercy.

467
01:09:00,458 --> 01:09:02,125
I will give you anything.

468
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:10,333
Death is not enough for you.

469
01:09:10,417 --> 01:09:13,167
You will know my pain.

470
01:09:18,083 --> 01:09:19,667
Elodie!

471
01:09:23,708 --> 01:09:25,042
Elodie!

472
01:09:38,417 --> 01:09:40,250
Elodie!

473
01:09:44,375 --> 01:09:45,958
Elodie!

474
01:09:46,042 --> 01:09:48,958
Be quiet.
She can hear you.

475
01:09:50,667 --> 01:09:54,042
I warned you. It's too late.
The beast lurks in its lair.

476
01:09:54,792 --> 01:09:58,375
- It's surely taken her there to devour--
- This lair. Where is it?

477
01:09:58,458 --> 01:10:01,083
Sir, your daughter's been
down here nigh on too long.

478
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:03,250
She's almost certainly been killed.

479
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:05,958
Elodie!

480
01:10:08,583 --> 01:10:11,083
I'm told some have tried
to hunt the beast.

481
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:13,542
For its blood.

482
01:10:14,708 --> 01:10:15,833
Nonsense.

483
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:21,000
Why are you here?

484
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:23,792
I'm here for my daughter.

485
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:26,250
Father.

486
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,792
Father.

487
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:10,792
Please.

488
01:12:12,042 --> 01:12:13,292
I beg of you.

489
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:27,542
It's not my mercy that you should seek.

490
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:30,292
Call her.

491
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:32,333
She's alive?

492
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:34,792
Elodie's still alive?

493
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,000
I smell her.

494
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:40,083
Hiding.

495
01:12:41,542 --> 01:12:42,958
Watching.

496
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:54,125
Call her.

497
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:56,125
No.

498
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:59,250
Call her.

499
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:05,500
Elodie.

500
01:13:07,958 --> 01:13:08,958
Can you hear me?

501
01:13:14,208 --> 01:13:19,083
I have... I have made a horrible,
horrible mistake.

502
01:13:20,917 --> 01:13:23,958
To sacrifice the one thing I love most.

503
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:27,167
To trade your life

504
01:13:28,708 --> 01:13:30,500
for the good of my people.

505
01:13:32,167 --> 01:13:34,458
I thought that I could take the gold.

506
01:13:37,125 --> 01:13:38,792
That I could live with myself.

507
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:41,500
My choice.

508
01:13:45,375 --> 01:13:46,458
But I can't.

509
01:13:48,667 --> 01:13:49,667
I can't.

510
01:13:57,833 --> 01:14:00,083
Tell her to come to you.

511
01:14:05,625 --> 01:14:07,792
Last chance.

512
01:14:11,958 --> 01:14:15,292
Elodie.
Hear me.

513
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,250
I am your father.
You will obey me.

514
01:14:21,917 --> 01:14:23,208
I order you.

515
01:14:24,292 --> 01:14:26,125
Do not come out!

516
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:30,750
No.

517
01:14:36,833 --> 01:14:37,833
No!

518
01:15:32,667 --> 01:15:33,833
Ellie.

519
01:15:39,833 --> 01:15:41,000
Use the ropes.

520
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:42,750
Your stepmother and Floria,

521
01:15:43,542 --> 01:15:46,667
they wait for you at the ship.

522
01:15:49,958 --> 01:15:51,375
Forgive me.

523
01:17:44,583 --> 01:17:46,042
Go! Go! Go!

524
01:18:04,792 --> 01:18:06,000
Go.

525
01:18:42,583 --> 01:18:46,083
That damn girl.
I knew she was trouble.

526
01:18:47,917 --> 01:18:49,667
- Where are you going?
- To fix this.

527
01:19:23,708 --> 01:19:26,000
- Stop.
- Stand back.

528
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:35,500
Elodie.

529
01:19:38,583 --> 01:19:39,583
Open up!

530
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:41,375
Get out of the way!

531
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,042
Get out!

532
01:19:51,083 --> 01:19:52,000
Seize her.

533
01:19:52,083 --> 01:19:53,333
You can't!

534
01:19:53,417 --> 01:19:55,208
- No! She's just a child!
- No!

535
01:19:55,292 --> 01:19:56,833
You promised us a daughter.

536
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:59,125
- Stepmother!
- No!

537
01:19:59,208 --> 01:20:00,625
Floria!

538
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:57,250
Elodie.

539
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:03,125
Stepmother.

540
01:21:06,708 --> 01:21:08,333
- Elodie.
- Stepmother.

541
01:21:08,417 --> 01:21:09,792
Oh!

542
01:21:09,875 --> 01:21:11,042
Thank God.

543
01:21:11,125 --> 01:21:12,583
Are you all right?

544
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:13,667
I can manage.

545
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:16,000
Where's Floria?

546
01:21:16,083 --> 01:21:18,917
They took her to the caves in your place.

547
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,042
I tried to stop them
from taking your sister.

548
01:21:21,125 --> 01:21:22,333
I have to save her.

549
01:21:22,417 --> 01:21:24,917
No, I'll go.
I can find her.

550
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,125
It may be too late.

551
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:28,083
No.

552
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,208
Not if I can help it.

553
01:21:31,708 --> 01:21:32,708
Your father...

554
01:21:36,583 --> 01:21:37,833
Go.

555
01:21:44,208 --> 01:21:47,375
Please. Let me go!

556
01:21:47,458 --> 01:21:49,583
Please let me go.

557
01:21:51,458 --> 01:21:52,292
No, don't do this.

558
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:54,667
Mother, enough!
She's too young.

559
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:58,875
A prince protects his kingdom,
without hesitation or complaint.

560
01:21:58,958 --> 01:22:00,000
Give me your hand.

561
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:03,125
I cannot do this.
She's just a child.

562
01:22:03,708 --> 01:22:05,833
You're weak.

563
01:22:05,917 --> 01:22:09,458
No! Please don't do this to me!

564
01:22:14,875 --> 01:22:16,667
Get off of me!

565
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:18,958
Let go!
Off of me!

566
01:22:19,042 --> 01:22:20,208
Throw her in.

567
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,208
Floria!

568
01:22:46,875 --> 01:22:48,583
Floria!

569
01:22:50,208 --> 01:22:51,958
Floria!

570
01:23:43,292 --> 01:23:44,833
I'm coming for you, Flor.

571
01:24:46,042 --> 01:24:47,750
My little ones...

572
01:24:50,417 --> 01:24:52,375
They did not let you live.

573
01:24:54,708 --> 01:24:58,000
Nor shall I let Elodie.

574
01:25:09,125 --> 01:25:12,625
Your sister will come for you.

575
01:25:28,917 --> 01:25:30,833
There she is now.

576
01:25:54,708 --> 01:25:56,833
Hello, Floria.
Floria, can you hear me?

577
01:25:57,708 --> 01:25:58,625
Wake up!

578
01:25:58,708 --> 01:26:00,417
We need to hurry.

579
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:01,542
Floria!

580
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:03,208
Ellie.

581
01:26:06,083 --> 01:26:07,542
Elodie, you're alive.

582
01:26:08,625 --> 01:26:11,000
Okay.
I'm going to get you out of here.

583
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:18,250
My leg.
I hurt it when I fell.

584
01:26:19,708 --> 01:26:21,167
We don't have time, Flor.

585
01:26:31,792 --> 01:26:33,750
No, no, no.
Not yet.

586
01:26:33,833 --> 01:26:34,875
What now?

587
01:26:34,958 --> 01:26:36,375
You have to hide quickly.

588
01:26:36,458 --> 01:26:37,625
What about you?

589
01:26:37,708 --> 01:26:39,167
I must tell her the truth.

590
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:40,250
Come on.

591
01:26:56,458 --> 01:26:59,167
Where are you hiding?

592
01:27:03,375 --> 01:27:04,583
Dragon.

593
01:27:09,417 --> 01:27:11,208
That won't kill me,

594
01:27:12,292 --> 01:27:14,667
but it will make me angry.

595
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:16,000
Good.

596
01:27:16,625 --> 01:27:18,667
I'm angry too.

597
01:27:23,375 --> 01:27:25,083
We have both been lied to.

598
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:27,667
They said you set upon their village.

599
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:30,083
That the king came
only to defend his people.

600
01:27:30,792 --> 01:27:33,750
He came unprovoked.

601
01:27:35,042 --> 01:27:36,333
I know what they did.

602
01:27:37,083 --> 01:27:38,542
I know they killed your children.

603
01:27:39,125 --> 01:27:41,625
"They"?
You!

604
01:27:41,708 --> 01:27:44,167
Your kind, your blood.

605
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:45,083
No!

606
01:27:45,167 --> 01:27:48,917
My daughters were the last of my line.

607
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,125
So, I will take their daughters
until my final breath.

608
01:27:53,833 --> 01:27:57,042
Except you haven't.
We are not their daughters.

609
01:27:57,125 --> 01:27:58,792
More lies.

610
01:28:36,542 --> 01:28:37,667
Ellie!

611
01:28:52,083 --> 01:28:56,833
Now, you will know my daughters' pain.

612
01:29:44,292 --> 01:29:46,542
I am not one of them!

613
01:29:51,667 --> 01:29:53,958
I smell it in your blood.

614
01:31:19,875 --> 01:31:23,458
El-o-die.

615
01:31:25,708 --> 01:31:28,083
Accept your fate...

616
01:31:34,042 --> 01:31:36,042
as I have mine.

617
01:31:40,125 --> 01:31:43,750
We are to die alone.

618
01:31:51,083 --> 01:31:52,375
No.

619
01:31:55,958 --> 01:31:57,917
I have an army with me.

620
01:32:00,583 --> 01:32:04,458
Every innocent woman
whose life was stolen down here.

621
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:11,000
Your kind were never innocent.

622
01:32:18,167 --> 01:32:19,417
Then go ahead.

623
01:32:23,625 --> 01:32:25,250
Show me your fire.

624
01:32:30,167 --> 01:32:31,167
Well?

625
01:32:32,333 --> 01:32:33,792
What are you waiting for?

626
01:32:36,917 --> 01:32:38,000
Burn me.

627
01:32:40,625 --> 01:32:41,667
Burn me!

628
01:33:45,625 --> 01:33:47,250
My sister had this too.

629
01:33:48,667 --> 01:33:49,792
All of us did.

630
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:52,917
That is how they make us royal.

631
01:33:54,292 --> 01:33:56,500
That is the blood you smell.

632
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,167
They fooled you.

633
01:34:10,167 --> 01:34:13,500
You've been killing
innocent daughters just like they did.

634
01:34:21,583 --> 01:34:24,583
Then, end it.

635
01:34:51,083 --> 01:34:52,083
No.

636
01:34:56,792 --> 01:34:59,042
I'm through doing what I'm told.

637
01:36:19,083 --> 01:36:20,083
Elodie.

638
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:29,583
You must believe me.
I haven't slept a moment since--

639
01:36:29,667 --> 01:36:31,500
Since you tried to kill my sister?

640
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
I had no choice.

641
01:36:34,083 --> 01:36:37,042
Don't you dare explain yourself to this...

642
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:38,708
this commoner.

643
01:36:42,958 --> 01:36:44,625
Is she to be the third?

644
01:36:45,583 --> 01:36:47,083
Princess number three.

645
01:36:48,833 --> 01:36:52,292
She's the last,
and then I'll be free to marry whoever I--

646
01:36:52,375 --> 01:36:54,042
That's enough, Henry.

647
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,417
You know nothing of what we've endured.

648
01:36:58,083 --> 01:37:00,333
You know nothing of our story.

649
01:37:08,667 --> 01:37:10,042
Take your family

650
01:37:11,875 --> 01:37:13,208
and run.

651
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:16,583
Come. Let's go.

652
01:37:18,417 --> 01:37:21,875
I will offer you all
one last chance to do the same.

653
01:37:29,375 --> 01:37:30,375
No?

654
01:37:32,292 --> 01:37:34,792
You insolent creature.

655
01:37:35,833 --> 01:37:37,583
You think we ought to fear you now?

656
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Why?

657
01:37:40,583 --> 01:37:43,792
Because you somehow
managed to escape the dragon?

658
01:37:47,583 --> 01:37:49,750
It's not me you should fear.

659
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,333
This is the end of your story.

660
01:37:55,417 --> 01:37:56,417
Run!

661
01:38:10,792 --> 01:38:13,458
- It's the dragon!
- Run!

662
01:38:36,167 --> 01:38:42,875
No!

663
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,167
Someone give me a hand
with this barrel.

664
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:32,917
Let's be sharp there, lads.

665
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,167
You can't be serious.

666
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:36,125
But I am.

667
01:39:36,208 --> 01:39:37,958
We'll run it together.

668
01:39:38,042 --> 01:39:39,625
We've got a bounty of supplies.

669
01:39:39,708 --> 01:39:42,083
Enough to get us through
this freeze and the next.

670
01:39:42,167 --> 01:39:43,208
Oh, Elodie.

671
01:39:43,292 --> 01:39:46,500
You're the only person I trust
to look after our people, Mother.

672
01:39:55,375 --> 01:39:56,542
Can I help too?

673
01:39:59,833 --> 01:40:00,833
Floria.

674
01:40:01,208 --> 01:40:02,833
I'm counting on it.

675
01:40:12,042 --> 01:40:14,583
Stepmother.
Stepmother, come and see this.

676
01:40:14,667 --> 01:40:16,250
Oh, wide heavens!

677
01:40:16,333 --> 01:40:19,500
