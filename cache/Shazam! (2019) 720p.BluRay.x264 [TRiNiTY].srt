§ Enjoy the flick §

2
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:03,780
Thad...

3
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,710
I said no toys
at Grandfather's.

4
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,220
But it's Christmas.

5
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,090
- Stop it!
- Hey.

6
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,150
Hey, Dad!

7
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,920
Hey! Thad,

8
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,790
you can't go crying to
other people all the time.

9
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,330
A man needs to know when
to stand up for himself.

10
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,860
Dear Magic-Isn't-Real Ball,

11
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,570
will Thad ever be a man?

12
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,170
Ouch.

13
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,240
"Outlook not so good."

14
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,560
You broke it.

15
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,890
Dad? Sid?

16
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,330
Someone help me!

17
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,940
Help!

18
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,770
Hello?

19
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,520
Thaddeus.

20
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,890
Thaddeus Sivana.

21
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,360
Who are you?

22
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,420
How do you know my name?

23
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,360
I am the last of
the Council of Wizards.

24
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,570
Sworn to protect the realms
from the Seven Deadly Sins.

25
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,810
But years have passed,

26
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,710
and I grow weak.

27
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,140
That is why
I seek a champion

28
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,350
to inherit my magic.

29
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,480
You want me to do magic?

30
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,820
With this,

31
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,790
all of my powers
will become yours.

32
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,830
Ah. But first...

33
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,760
you must demonstrate
that you're pure of heart

34
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,070
and strong in spirit.

35
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,140
He lies.

36
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,280
Don't be his champion.

37
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,250
We can give you power.

38
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,150
Take the eye.

39
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,590
Take it.

40
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,000
Your father thinks
you're weak.

41
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Show him your power.

42
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,100
Take the eye.

43
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,410
No!

44
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,680
What?

45
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,250
What happened?

46
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:04,020
Only the purest of hearts
can resist their temptations.

47
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,750
But you,

48
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,690
you will never be worthy.

49
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,130
Wait.

50
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,170
- I'm good enough, I swear!
- What?

51
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,430
Let me back in!

52
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,970
Calm down, Thad!

53
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,300
- Don't open the door!
- Stop it!

54
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,570
- Calm down.
- Stop!

55
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,140
Hey, I'm gonna kill you,
you little freak!

56
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,710
Stop... Oh!

57
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,930
I was just there.

58
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,130
This man, this wizard,
he took me to a castle and...

59
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,500
Stop. Stop!

60
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,200
Stop it!

61
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,800
You miserable, whiny,
little shit!

62
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,740
You could have killed us!

63
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,510
Do you understand that?

64
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,190
Dad?

65
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,190
Dad!

66
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,040
Dad?

67
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,840
You're okay.

68
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,240
You're gonna be okay.

69
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,120
You did this.

70
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,690
You did this!

71
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,150
No.

72
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
Dad.

73
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,250
Your magic grows weak.

74
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:52,490
Soon, you won't be able to
contain us.

75
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,960
Seeking Spell,

76
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,230
find me one soul
who is worthy.

77
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,770
No matter
how long it takes.

78
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,910
Holy moly! The boys in blue!

79
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,710
Sure glad to see you.

80
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,950
I called as soon as I saw.

81
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,220
They're in there.

82
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,290
You stay here.

83
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,660
Police!

84
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,060
I saw 'em hide
back in there.

85
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,840
- Police, coming in!
- Police!

86
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,470
- There's nobody here.
- What do you mean?

87
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,440
- It's a closet.
- You really bought that, huh?

88
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,180
- Hey, no, no, no!
- Hey!

89
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,120
Stop, stop, stop!

90
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,520
Open this up
right now, kid.

91
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,620
That's a federal offense, kid.
You can't do that!

92
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,590
Do not go in that car.

93
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,820
Come on,
open the door. Please.

94
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,430
Please, come on.

95
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,400
Open this, right now!

96
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,270
Very good, very funny.

97
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,000
Very funny. That's great.
That's hilarious.

98
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,110
Uh, Dispatch, we need backup at the
Laurelwood shopping center, please.

99
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,980
Dispatch, cancel that request.

100
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,080
Some kid stole
our walkie-talkies.

101
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,280
<i>Walkie-talkies? How old are you?</i>

102
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,660
No, no, no.

103
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,830
That's my lunch, kid!

104
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,170
Miss Batson...

105
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,270
I've been looking for you.

106
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,510
No. Gosh.

107
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,410
It's me. It's Billy.

108
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,490
Okay.

109
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,290
I want the tiger.

110
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:46,330
I know, honey, I know.
But Mom's not exactly going pro here.

111
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,030
We got one!

112
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,170
But I wanted a tiger.

113
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,340
Oh, but this is
the real prize, baby. See?

114
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,940
You can use that
your whole life.

115
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,250
You'll always find your way.

116
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,470
I can't let
the ball get away.

117
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,850
Mom?

118
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:42,990
Mom!

119
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,130
Mom!

120
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,160
Hey.

121
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,530
Who are you with, bud?

122
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,540
Yeah, he says
it's Billy Batson.

123
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,800
Hey, don't worry, kid.

124
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,640
I'm sure she'll come looking
before too long, okay?

125
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,040
They always do.

126
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,920
Mom, I'm home.

127
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,390
Yes?

128
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,090
Yeah, uh,
is this Rachel Batson?

129
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,860
Who's asking?

130
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,930
Um...

131
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,530
Yeah, see, the thing is...

132
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,670
I think you're my mom.

133
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,570
You sure about that?

134
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,280
Sorry to bother you.

135
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,280
Just had to take my lunch, huh?

136
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,020
You save me any fries?

137
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,220
Foster home in Pittsburgh reported
you missing two weeks ago.

138
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,490
You're sending me back?

139
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,560
No.

140
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,960
They don't want you.

141
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,200
- Harsh.
- You laugh,

142
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,040
but you've run from foster homes
in six counties, Mr. Batson.

143
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,570
From good people

144
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,070
who want you,
all in pursuit of someone

145
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,050
who arguably does not.

146
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:53,350
It's time someone looked you in the
eye and told it to you straight.

147
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,280
I don't need parents
to play make-believe with.

148
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,150
- I got a mom.
- Yes.

149
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,290
You're some detective.

150
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,090
Seventy-three Batsons

151
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:06,930
between the ages of 28 to 40,
and you've crossed out every one.

152
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,730
She's still out there.
I know it.

153
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:21,110
There's a couple outside,
Mr. Batson.

154
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,980
They run a group home.

155
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,950
I can take care of myself.

156
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,610
When you're 18.

157
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,420
Until then, I won't have you
living on the streets,

158
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,620
looking for someone
who never looked for you.

159
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,120
Give these people
a chance.

160
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,790
'Cause that's what
they're giving you.

161
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,460
You're out of options.

162
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,470
I'm gonna skip the spiel.

163
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,380
Just know that me and
Rosa, we get it.

164
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,040
We were foster kids
back in the day.

165
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,710
Ooh, back in the Dark Ages.

166
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,180
Girl, I'm young at heart.

167
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,820
I got my finger
on the pulse.

168
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,350
Yeah, that's a reference

169
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,620
to his blood pressure because he's old.

170
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,220
Billy, do you have
any food allergies?

171
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,090
Gonna wish you did.
Darla's cooking.

172
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,760
What?

173
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,960
We know how
overwhelming it can all be.

174
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,830
New house, new faces.

175
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,360
All up in your face.

176
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,240
Just take it
at your own speed.

177
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,280
Hello?

178
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,650
We're home.

179
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,120
That's what happens
when you suck!

180
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,620
So much
for the welcome party.

181
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,960
Yeah, that thing
growing out of the couch

182
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,530
would be Eugene.

183
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,860
Is that him?

184
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,630
Oh, my gosh! Billy!

185
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,060
Whoa!
Slow down, slow down.

186
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,330
Welcome home!

187
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,230
- And that's Darla.
- I'm Darla.

188
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,170
Big hugger.

189
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,740
I noticed.

190
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,770
Die, die, die!

191
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,710
He doesn't mean that.
It's a game.

192
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,380
Hey.

193
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,850
No sodas after dark,
remember?

194
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,580
Whoa. When did it get dark?

195
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,820
Oh, the poster.
I made you one.

196
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,090
Come look! Oh, no!

197
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,890
Sorry, Pedro must've been
working out.

198
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,460
His goal is to get swole.

199
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,560
Just one hit!
Just one hit!

200
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,660
Oh...

201
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,830
Here.

202
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:26,730
Yes, exactly why your math department
is so uniquely suited for me.

203
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,230
Shut up! No!

204
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,440
I can't even
with Eugene right now.

205
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,210
I'm sorry. Mary, hi.
College interview.

206
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,340
I'm Billy.

207
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,880
What am I
most excited about?

208
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,350
Oh! What a great question.
I was hoping you'd ask.

209
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,210
What am I most
excited about?

210
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,950
Mention you're a foster kid.
Colleges eat that up.

211
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:48,290
What I'm most excited about
is the campus experience.

212
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,130
As a foster child, I'm a big believer
in finding family and friends

213
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,530
in the most unlikely
of places.

214
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,200
I'm gonna miss that girl
so much.

215
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,570
It's Caltech.
It's a very prestigious school.

216
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,270
And also all the way
in California.

217
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,610
But we don't have to talk
about that right now.

218
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,140
It's a tough subject
for me.

219
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,440
Do you like vegan food?

220
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,880
- Mmm-mmm.
- Because, see, I love animals.

221
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,420
Oh, no! The Tofurky!

222
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,250
Oh, no, we may have to eat
a real turkey!

223
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,390
- Is that...
- It's okay.

224
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,350
Come, I'll show you
your room.

225
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,620
It's a bit of a madhouse,
I know, but it's fun.

226
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,360
Time to dance
on your grave!

227
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,100
Watch the bum step. Pedro...

228
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,490
Say hi to Billy.

229
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,700
Don't take it personally.
He's like that with everyone.

230
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,740
Freddy.

231
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,540
This is Billy Batson.

232
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,210
Make sure you make him
feel at home.

233
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,410
- Okay?
- Yeah.

234
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,380
Maybe don't say anything
too weird?

235
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,220
Oh, one weird thing is,

236
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,900
did you know that Romans used to
brush their teeth with their urine?

237
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,390
And apparently, it works.

238
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,460
Yep. Um...

239
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,730
Oh, it's a long way down.

240
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,310
Trust me, I speak
from experience.

241
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,180
Victor pushed me.

242
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,080
They seem nice,
but don't buy it.

243
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,420
It gets real <i>Game of Thrones</i>
around here.

244
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,320
What?

245
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,460
Dude, I'm just
messin' around.

246
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,260
It's, um, terminal cancer.
I only have three months.

247
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,960
Kidding, again!
You look at me, and you're like,

248
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,800
"Why so dark? You're a disabled foster kid.
You've got it all."

249
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,840
Right?

250
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,570
Oh, yeah,
that's the old Batarang.

251
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,410
I mean, it's a replica,
but feel how sharp.

252
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,250
I could kill you in your
sleep with that thing.

253
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,480
You more of a Supes guy?

254
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,150
Yeah, me, too.
Behold, the holy grail.

255
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,050
One nine-millimeter round
shot at Superman himself.

256
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,750
It's legit.

257
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,320
Probably worth, I don't know,
five, six hundred, maybe more.

258
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,490
What's in the bag?

259
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,730
Hey.

260
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,060
Hey, it's all good.
It's good to maintain boundaries.

261
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,930
You don't gotta talk
so much, you know.

262
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,740
Anyway, this place is great.
You're gonna love it.

263
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,700
Dinner!

264
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,740
All hands on deck.

265
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,580
Thank you for this family.

266
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,180
Thank you for this day.

267
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,010
Thank you for this food,
even if it's not steak filet.

268
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:07,050
Big school.
2,000 students, you might think,

269
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,690
"Wow, so many strangers."

270
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,260
But not if you think of them
as possible future friends.

271
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,460
Then it's,
"Wow, so many friends."

272
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,700
The principal, her name's Shirley.
She's the best.

273
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,630
Next.

274
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,370
This is
our security scanner.

275
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,940
Like in an airport.
It's totally safe.

276
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,840
I know what it is.

277
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,870
- Does she always do this?
- Mmm-hmm.

278
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,380
Silence makes me
uncomfortable.

279
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,950
She's almost never
uncomfortable.

280
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,750
Have a good first day,
big brother.

281
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,890
Look, you don't have to
hug me all the time.

282
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,460
We're not actually
brother and sister, so...

283
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,390
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,930
- Hey.
- Hey.

285
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,700
I didn't mean
to make her...

286
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,540
<i>I was overwhelmed, honestly.</i>

287
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:01,210
<i>He said
I must be pure of heart.</i>

288
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,480
<i>He call himself a wizard.</i>

289
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,220
<i>He even dressed like a wizard
from</i> Harry Potter <i>or some...</i>

290
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,420
<i>But you're saying that other
people have experienced this?</i>

291
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:17,060
In a sense, yes.
Do you remember what he said to you?

292
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,730
<i>He tested me.</i>

293
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,230
<i>There were these statues.</i>

294
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:26,330
<i>Their eyes, it's like they were
looking at me, making me think things.</i>

295
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,970
<i>Horrible things.</i>

296
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,410
And do these approximate
what you saw?

297
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:35,710
<i>Yes, that's exactly
how I remember it.</i>

298
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,580
<i>I don't understand.
How do you know...</i>

299
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,020
Recurrent imagery has proven very
common in cases of mass hysteria.

300
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,050
<i>Mass hysteria?</i>

301
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,790
I know. The term's
a bit theatrical.

302
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,660
But take UFO sightings,
for example.

303
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,130
Lights in the sky,
flying saucers.

304
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:54,260
Isolated incidents of people
who do not know each other...

305
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,760
The symbols.

306
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,400
Ask her about the symbols.

307
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:06,770
Sorry, Ms. Kwan.
But as an example of recurrent imagery,

308
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,740
maybe you'll recall seeing

309
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,210
these symbols
before the alleged abduction.

310
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:15,080
<i>I don't remember
any symbols, no.</i>

311
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,920
<i>I think I got it on video.
There was something, um...</i>

312
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,190
<i>I remember the numbers
on my alarm clock.</i>

313
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,460
<i>They kept shifting.</i>

314
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,660
Video?

315
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,730
Show me the video.

316
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:30,330
Uh, Ms. Kwan,
this is Dr. Sivana.

317
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,470
<i>Um, one moment, I can send it.</i>

318
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:37,270
<i>Hello? Oh, my God!</i>

319
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,140
<i>Who's there?</i>

320
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,510
<i>Hello? What's going on?
What's happening?</i>

321
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,350
<i>I'm going to call
the police!</i>

322
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:50,050
<i>Then this blinding light
all around me</i>

323
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,320
<i>and I felt like I was getting
pulled down into something.</i>

324
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,090
<i>It felt like a temple
carved inside a mountain.</i>

325
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,190
<i>He looked exactly what you'd expect
from a guy who calls himself a wizard.</i>

326
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,360
<i>...and how you were brought
there to save the world.</i>

327
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,600
<i>- Wearing a cape.</i>
<i>- And there's no ceiling.</i>

328
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,030
We ran the numbers again...

329
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,630
Dr. Sivana!

330
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,840
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
but you're funding my project.

331
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,910
And when I'm interviewing,
I don't wanna be interrupted.

332
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,280
Fifty-six recorded abductions.

333
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,750
- I never saw it.
- Saw what?

334
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,260
Doctor, what is all this?

335
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,270
All these years...

336
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:44,340
I was convinced
I had the incorrect sequence.

337
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,340
Or perhaps the wrong symbols

338
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,010
to open the door.

339
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,180
But on that woman's
alarm clock,

340
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,690
the seven symbols.

341
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:02,660
The sequence
repeated itself seven times.

342
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,090
That's the difference.

343
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,400
Is this
some sort of joke?

344
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,160
It may seem that way to you

345
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:14,570
because we're not in actuality
studying mass hysteria.

346
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:17,240
What all these people
have seen,

347
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,880
every single one of them,
is absolutely real.

348
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,980
An alarm clock malfunctions

349
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:27,110
and your first thought is
it's proof of a wizard?

350
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,220
- Hmm.
- Come on, Dr. Sivana.

351
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,960
You can't believe
any of this is real.

352
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:45,830
Why, yes.

353
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,740
Yes, I do.

354
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:36,850
I've been waiting for
this moment for so long...

355
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:40,250
and now here we are.

356
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,290
You don't remember me,
do you?

357
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,970
I remember you.

358
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,900
You were a boy.

359
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,000
And now you dare intrude
in my kingdom.

360
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,410
Do you know what it's like for a child
to be told you'll never be good enough?

361
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:02,410
No, you don't.

362
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:06,680
What you said to me all those years
ago made me realize who I really was.

363
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,320
And you know something?

364
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,790
I am not pure of heart.

365
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:18,390
The wizard
is too weak to stop us.

366
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,130
No!

367
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,270
No!

368
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:35,080
You never found
your champion.

369
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,420
But we found ours.

370
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:58,470
You are the true champion.

371
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,370
They're using you.

372
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:34,570
You're nothing to them
but a means of escape.

373
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,740
Through you, they'll spread their
poison to everything they touch!

374
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:48,010
Make mankind
turn on each other!

375
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,580
You seek a pure soul, old man,

376
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,920
but no one's worthy.

377
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,500
Flight or invisibility?

378
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,100
If you could have
one superpower,

379
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,140
flight or invisibility,
what would you pick?

380
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,670
I mean, everybody chooses flight.
You know why?

381
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,840
So they can fly away
from this conversation?

382
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,510
No, no.
'Cause heroes fly.

383
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,480
And who doesn't want people to
think they're a hero, right?

384
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,880
But invisibility, no way.

385
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,550
That's pervy.

386
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,620
Spying around on people who
don't even know you're there.

387
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,650
Sneaking around everywhere.
It's a total villain power, right?

388
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,760
Then they did this study,
and this is a real thing.

389
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,000
They asked people
the same question.

390
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,670
You know, what power
do you want?

391
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,030
But this time, they made it
so the answers were anonymous.

392
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,500
And most people,
since they knew

393
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,200
that it was secret,
said invisibility.

394
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,640
And I think that's 'cause
most people

395
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,170
don't feel like heroes
on the inside, deep down.

396
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:48,270
You're gonna run away.

397
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,840
I mean, you stole
my Superman bullet.

398
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,680
Dude, I get it.
I get it.

399
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,550
You've been screwed over
way too many times.

400
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,450
You don't trust anyone.

401
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:01,150
That's the thing about invisibility.
You end up all by yourself.

402
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,930
I didn't steal your dumb bullet.

403
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,200
Hey. How was it today?

404
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,600
That good, huh?

405
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:19,040
Whoa!

406
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,810
Oh, my God! Freddy.

407
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,940
Are you okay?

408
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,350
- You okay?
- Yes. Yes.

409
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,480
What the hell?

410
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,120
- What is wrong with you two?
- Oh, ho!

411
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,880
No way that's gonna buff out.

412
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,220
You gonna pay
for that, Freeman?

413
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,890
For the dent you made
almost hitting me?

414
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,020
Yeah, sure. Um...

415
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,490
You guys take these?

416
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,190
Brett, stop!

417
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,760
Don't touch my brother!

418
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,670
What, do you need your fake
family to stand up for you?

419
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,230
- Stand up for yourself, Freeman.
- Yeah, huh?

420
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,940
Hey, Freeman.
Freeman, here, stand up.

421
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,370
Stand up for yourself.

422
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:51,700
What are you gonna do,
go home and cry to Mommy?

423
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:54,270
Oh, yeah.
You don't have a mommy.

424
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,410
Hey.

425
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:02,380
Man, sorry about that.

426
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:04,950
That wasn't fair,
but then again you don't fight fair, so...

427
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:13,190
Back off, assbags.
I know how to use these things.

428
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,900
Hey! He's getting away!
Where you going?

429
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,500
Freddy, are you okay?

430
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,610
Hey, let's go
through the back.

431
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:26,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

432
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,850
Nowhere to run!

433
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,220
Hey!

434
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,980
- Go, go, go!
- Grab him! Move!

435
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,520
- Get out the way.
- Move, woman!

436
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,520
Whoa!

437
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:45,830
No, no, no.

438
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,190
You're dead, kid.

439
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,660
Yeah, you think
you're funny.

440
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,530
We know where you go to
school, buddy!

441
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,730
<i>Next stop, 30th Street Station.</i>

442
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,070
<i>Change for the regional
rail lines.</i>

443
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,160
Uh... Hello?

444
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,700
What's going on?

445
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,150
Help!

446
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,760
Okay.

447
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,110
Holy moly.

448
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,590
Hello?

449
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,080
What the hell?

450
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,750
Who's doing this?

451
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,040
Hi. Um...

452
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,710
I was supposed to get off
at 30th.

453
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,320
Billy Batson.

454
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,950
How'd you know my name?

455
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:29,290
I am the last of
the Council of Wizards.

456
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:31,760
Keeper of
the Rock of Eternity.

457
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,530
Oh...

458
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,900
You're...

459
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,360
that guy.

460
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:39,230
Hey, listen, I don't have
any money.

461
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,440
Do not patronize me, boy.

462
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,070
You are standing
in the source of all magic.

463
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:52,440
The Rock of Eternity.
Seven thrones of seven wizards.

464
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:56,120
But long ago,
we chose a champion

465
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,150
and we chose recklessly.

466
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,460
He used his power for revenge,

467
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:08,660
releasing the Seven Deadly
Sins into your world.

468
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:14,800
Millions of lives were lost.

469
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,510
Entire civilizations
erased from existence.

470
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:27,210
That is why I vowed
never to pass on my magic

471
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:31,590
until I find
one truly good person.

472
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:34,690
Strong in spirit,

473
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:37,190
pure in heart.

474
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:40,430
Look, man,
maybe this is magic

475
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,060
and, I don't know,

476
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:46,400
but the people you're looking
for, good, pure people,

477
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,600
I'm not one of them.

478
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,740
I don't know
if anyone is, really.

479
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:54,340
You, Billy Batson,

480
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,510
are all I have.

481
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:59,380
All the world has.

482
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,220
Lay your hands on my staff.

483
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,820
Gross.

484
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,850
And say my name so my
powers may flow through you.

485
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:11,560
I open my heart to you,
Billy Batson.

486
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,930
And in so doing,
choose you as champion.

487
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,500
Thanks.

488
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,930
Real sweet of you, mister,
but I really gotta get going.

489
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,870
My brothers and sisters
were slain by the Sins.

490
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:27,170
Their thrones lie empty.

491
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:29,780
My magic
must be passed on.

492
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:33,050
Now, speak my name!

493
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,420
I don't know your name, sir.
We just met.

494
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,690
My name is...

495
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,960
Shazam.

496
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,260
Wait, for real?

497
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,960
- Say it!
- Okay!

498
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,760
Jeez.

499
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,880
So just say it? Like...

500
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,980
Shazam?

501
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,610
Yes!

502
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:08,510
Carry my name, and with it,
you carry all my powers.

503
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,420
The wisdom of Solomon,
the strength of Hercules,

504
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,720
the stamina of Atlas,
the power of Zeus,

505
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,630
the courage of Achilles,
and the speed of Mercury.

506
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,840
What happened to me?
Why am...

507
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,900
What did you do to me?
What did you do to my voice?

508
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,840
You have been transformed to your
full potential, Billy Batson.

509
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:42,110
With your heart,
unlock your greatest power.

510
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,720
The thrones of our brothers
and sisters await.

511
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,930
Get me outta here!

512
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,870
Dope!

513
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:07,070
My brother,
I applaud your choices today.

514
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:09,940
Gold shoes, gold belt,
white cape.

515
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,480
It shouldn't work,
but hot damn, it does!

516
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,820
Ow!

517
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,960
Hey!

518
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,900
Hey, babe!

519
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,500
<i>Yes, Officer.</i>

520
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,070
I'm aware he's run away
in the past.

521
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,110
Twenty-three times?

522
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:43,740
Guy's got no social media presence.
At all.

523
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,050
The guy is a ghost.

524
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,540
You know, guys,
I'm happy to look for Billy.

525
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,870
More than happy.

526
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,340
But no, you gotta wash
the dishes.

527
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,840
That's what's
more important.

528
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,240
"What are you gonna do,
Freddy, run after him?"

529
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,950
Very funny.

530
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,950
No, I said, don't scream.

531
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,610
- Uh... Victor? Victor!
- No, no!

532
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,180
- Victor!
- It's me. It's Billy.

533
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,990
It's Billy!

534
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:28,050
You asked me flight or invisibility.
I thought that was stupid,

535
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,790
but now I look like this
and I need your help.

536
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,790
Meet me back here
after lights-out?

537
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,160
'Sup, bud? You all right?

538
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,500
Yeah. Yeah. I'm just...

539
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,840
I'm really sad
because Billy's gone.

540
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,610
And, you know, maybe it's my fault.
Maybe I did it.

541
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,240
Uh, you know, maybe I snore.

542
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,640
Hey, hey, hey.
Not your fault, son, all right?

543
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,650
We'll find him, 'kay?

544
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,610
You don't snore that bad.

545
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,620
But you kinda smell.

546
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,230
Oh, thank God!

547
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,200
Hey. Stop right there.

548
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,700
How do I know you're not a
supervillain using telepathic abilities

549
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,840
to make me believe
that you're Billy? Huh?

550
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,040
What?

551
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,640
All I have to do
is press "dial" on this thing.

552
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,110
No! No, I have proof.
I have proof. Here.

553
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,640
Look, I lied, okay?
I took your bullet.

554
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,880
- Oh, no! No, no, no.
- No!

555
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,250
Stupid adult hands.

556
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,950
But you saw it.

557
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:34,020
You saw it, right?
Look, Freddy, I swear. It's me, okay?

558
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,950
Look, I know we're not really
close friends or anything,

559
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,460
but you're the only person
that I know

560
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,990
that knows anything about
this caped crusader stuff.

561
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:41,060
- That's Batman.
- What?

562
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,800
Forget it.

563
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,800
Can I...

564
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,870
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

565
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:59,280
Oh... Oh, my God!

566
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,480
It's crazy, right?

567
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,280
What are your superpowers?

568
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,120
Superpowers? Dude, I don't even
know how to pee in this thing.

569
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,720
Okay. Can you fly?

570
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:11,720
<i>Okay!</i>

571
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,560
Let's do this.

572
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,360
How do we do this?

573
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,830
Just, um, like, Superman it.

574
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,130
Oh, my God.
Obviously, you have to jump.

575
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,470
Come on.

576
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,170
How is any of this obvious?

577
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,710
Okay.

578
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,640
Try, uh, to believe
that you can fly. Okay?

579
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:32,010
I read this deep dive

580
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:33,680
into peer-reviewed studies
about superpowers

581
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,480
and in six out of ten,
belief is the key.

582
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,120
Belief. Belief. Belief. Okay.
Okay. I believe I can fly.

583
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,020
I believe I...

584
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,020
I believe I can fly.

585
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,160
I believe...

586
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,200
Whoa!

587
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,070
Did you believe?

588
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,470
Yeah.

589
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,980
You wanna try invisibility?

590
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,610
How do I do...

591
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,110
Forget it. You know, okay.

592
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:06,080
Okay, okay, okay.

593
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:11,620
Oh, my God! It worked!

594
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,820
Where'd you go?

595
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,320
I'm right here.
You can't see me?

596
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,620
Where?

597
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,820
I'm invisible!

598
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:20,590
I'm right here. Over here.

599
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,530
I'm invisible!
I'm invisible!

600
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:25,560
Hey!

601
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,200
Nice outfit, dipshit.

602
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,200
I might've been testing invisibility

603
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:33,240
and super-intelligence
at the same time.

604
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,240
Freeman, I'm gonna come
over there and beat you.

605
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,550
Oh, my God! The lightning emblem!

606
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:48,260
It was staring us right in
the face the whole time.

607
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,890
Literally!

608
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,700
Okay, okay.

609
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,230
Clearly, we gotta give you

610
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,840
- a lightning-themed superhero name.
- Yeah.

611
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,150
Oh, right.

612
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,150
Hey, yo! Back...

613
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,280
off.

614
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:23,020
Hyper-speed, check.

615
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,090
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

616
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:26,690
I thought you were the one
who was screaming.

617
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,570
I doused him with pepper spray.

618
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,360
Smart move.

619
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,470
Yeah, hey, Mr. Mugger Guy.
Give the old lady her purse back.

620
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,370
I'm your age.

621
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:37,740
And he didn't get a chance to take
it 'cause I didn't let him take it.

622
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,310
Good. Yeah, good.
You're really on top of this stuff.

623
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,410
And that should teach you
that old ladies...

624
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:46,510
Regular-aged ladies like yourself
don't need your protecting, right?

625
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,780
So get woke, bro.

626
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,350
I'm sorry, who are you?

627
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:51,920
His name is Thundercrack,

628
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,920
hero to the people with all the power
and speed of lightning all in one.

629
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,320
Dude, that sounds
like a butt thing.

630
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,690
Mister Philadelphia.

631
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:02,160
That's a cream cheese thing,
dude!

632
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,830
Power Boy.
'Cause he's got all the powers.

633
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:06,400
'Cause sometimes pepper spray
can't protect against evil.

634
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,470
Power Boy, do you know
this child?

635
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:13,570
Like a teeny little bit.
I don't really know...

636
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:15,570
Yeah. He's like
a little miniature manager.

637
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,540
I'm his manager.

638
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:20,080
But Power Boy's not gonna work, either,
okay? So work on something else.

639
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,750
Hey, bud, what could...

640
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,820
Electricity manipulation,
hyper-speed, super-strength.

641
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,220
Dude, you're stacked!

642
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:33,030
You're almost as cool
as Superman. Almost.

643
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,090
I didn't see you.
I don't know what just happened here.

644
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,930
I don't wanna know.
Just don't hurt me.

645
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:38,200
I'm not doing it
for the money.

646
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,670
Thank you for
your kind donation.

647
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:41,400
No, no, no, but if you
ever need any more help

648
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,340
just look for the superhero
that still can't fly.

649
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:46,300
Forget flying, man.
We just made 73 bucks!

650
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:48,340
Seventy-three bucks?

651
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,950
Come on!

652
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:52,650
Hey, wait a minute.

653
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:54,210
I just got an idea.

654
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,950
I'd like to purchase some of
your finest beer, please.

655
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,270
I don't know about this.
I mean, we don't have a fake ID even.

656
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:21,240
Freddy, Freddy,
would you relax?

657
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,110
Look at me. I am the fake ID.

658
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:25,340
Everything from the register!

659
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:27,110
Go, go! Now!

660
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:29,680
Come on! We don't have any time.
Let's go. Move!

661
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,020
We want it all! Hurry.

662
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,420
This is your chance.

663
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:35,690
Oh! Okay.

664
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:38,130
Come on, come on, come on!
Let's do this!

665
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:40,000
That's it. That's it.

666
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,400
Gentlemen,

667
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,800
why use guns when we can
handle this like real men?

668
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,440
Billy, look out!

669
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,720
Bullet immunity.
You have bullet immunity!

670
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,490
I'm bulletproof.

671
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,090
Today is December 8th,

672
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:12,530
and this is video proof of
authenticity.

673
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,290
Shoot him again.

674
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,960
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Here, here. Go. Both of you!

675
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,400
Come on. Go to town.

676
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:26,340
Wait, wait, wait.

677
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,640
We still don't know if
the suit is bulletproof,

678
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,280
or if you are.

679
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:32,380
Shoot him in the face.

680
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,250
Shoot me in the face.
In the face?

681
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:43,620
It kinda tickles.

682
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:45,720
You're dead.

683
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:53,070
- Sorry about your window.
- Have a good night!

684
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:55,370
But you're welcome
for not getting robbed!

685
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:58,700
Come on!
Let's get outta here.

686
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:00,170
Hey.

687
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:02,040
- To fighting bad guys.
- Yeah.

688
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,080
Bleh!

689
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:06,980
Ugh!

690
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,610
That tastes
like actual vomit.

691
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,550
Hey, do you know
habanero jerky,

692
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:15,650
if you eat enough of it,
it can burn a hole in your stomach?

693
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:16,820
Worth it.

694
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:18,190
Yeah.
Probably not you, though.

695
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:19,760
You've probably got
stomach superpowers.

696
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,160
Probably. Oh, hey.

697
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,530
What's up?
I'm a superhero.

698
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,100
Yeah, his name is, uh,

699
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,600
Captain Sparklefingers.

700
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,700
No, it's not. No, it's not!
That's not my name.

701
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,270
Hey, we should hang out.
We're, like, the same age.

702
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:32,000
Oh, okay. I'm out.

703
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:33,380
Hey, wait up!

704
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:42,110
I mean,
it's a pretty sick view.

705
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:45,590
I totally get why Rocky was
training so hard to get up here.

706
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:50,320
You know, I like you like this.
This is so cool.

707
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,060
I mean, no offense,

708
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:58,030
but, like, at first you were kinda
like the opposite of how Darla is.

709
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:00,300
A dick?

710
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,800
Your words. Not mine.

711
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,340
But yeah.

712
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:07,310
All right, well,
I feel like every criminal

713
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:09,570
is either on drugs or asleep
by now.

714
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,010
Wanna head home?

715
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:13,410
Looking like this?

716
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:14,680
Well, yeah,

717
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,750
I mean, usually,
we'd have a lair to go back to,

718
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,620
but that's long-term.

719
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:22,420
Right now, we have
a bunk bed.

720
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:29,030
Just scares me thinking of
him out there all alone.

721
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:32,160
This is what he does, Rosa.

722
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:34,400
Difference is,
when they find him,

723
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,840
we'll be the first
to take him back.

724
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,310
With open arms.

725
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,710
Didn't even make it two days.
Not even two days.

726
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:46,740
Baby, we did our fair share
of running off back when.

727
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,510
At least I did.

728
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,920
- Yeah.
- Even Mary did it.

729
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,350
Hmm? Twice.

730
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:56,150
That second time
she ran off,

731
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,560
you said something to me
I'll never forget.

732
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:00,360
You said,

733
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,760
"It's not a home
until you call it a home.

734
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,530
It's something you choose."

735
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:10,700
All we can do is give him
a place full of love.

736
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:14,310
Whether he chooses to call it a
home, that's up to him.

737
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:17,680
Yeah.

738
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:20,910
You gonna help me
with this tree?

739
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:24,190
This tree's so sad.

740
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:27,490
Hello?

741
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:29,590
Got lost
finding the bathroom.

742
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:31,460
Oh, okay, Freddy, sweetie.
Good night.

743
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:32,960
- Good night.
- Night.

744
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,730
Freddy, who is that?

745
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:39,230
It's Billy. He's just really
tired and he has laryngitis.

746
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:40,400
What? Laryngitis!

747
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,200
I'm just kidding!
I'm just kidding.

748
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,000
He's really, really tired,
and he wants to go to beddy-bye.

749
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:45,510
- Beddy-bye? Who says beddy-bye?
- Just hide, hide.

750
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:48,140
Billy, you're back.
Let us see you.

751
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:50,410
We've been so worried
about you.

752
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:52,240
I told you
this was a bad idea!

753
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:53,950
Freddy?

754
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:57,030
Freddy,
what happened to the stairs?

755
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:58,720
Mmm!

756
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,220
Hey! Covering her mouth
like you're gonna kidnap her

757
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:01,780
is not gonna make her
less scared, okay?

758
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,220
Darla, it's me. It's Billy.
I know I don't look like me.

759
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:07,390
A wizard made me
look like this.

760
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,660
Maybe don't start
with "wizard."

761
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,730
It's just gonna make her
more confused.

762
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:13,290
Some old guy brought me to a temple
and he made me say, "Shazam."

763
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:16,540
Rosa!

764
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,740
Verbally triggered
body-manipulation properties!

765
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:20,340
You can switch
by saying, "Shazam."

766
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:25,680
Baby, was that you?
Are you okay?

767
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,010
Uh...

768
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:29,310
I was screwing in a bulb.

769
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,380
Listen to me, Darla. You cannot
tell anybody about this, all right?

770
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:34,520
But it's Billy.
He's a hero.

771
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,050
Yeah, but if a supervillain
finds out that he's a hero,

772
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,620
that endangers us, okay?

773
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:40,560
A hero's loved ones are
the perfect bad guy target.

774
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,190
I mean, is she even good
at keeping secrets?

775
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,930
- Moderate.
- No.

776
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:44,960
Oh, God.

777
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:46,670
Okay, listen, D,

778
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:48,970
you cannot tell a single soul about
this, all right? Please?

779
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:51,670
Why? What if it's people
we trust?

780
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:56,570
Because good sisters
don't tell secrets.

781
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:59,240
- I'm a good sister.
- Yeah, you are.

782
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:00,850
You know what'd make you
an even better sister?

783
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:02,220
Is if you fixed
the doorknob for us, okay?

784
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,480
Yeah.

785
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,320
- Sweet dreams.
- Sweet dreams. Bye.

786
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,840
- See you in the morning.
- Good night.

787
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:14,230
Hello, sir.
How may I help you?

788
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:16,560
Hi. Sir?

789
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,830
Sir, you can't go in there.
Excuse me!

790
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:21,230
You cannot go in there!

791
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,510
Sorry I'm late.

792
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:28,870
Thad, this is for
board members only.

793
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,380
I'm aware of that, Father.

794
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:38,950
Now, that night in the car.

795
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:43,220
I swore to you I saw something,
but you never believed me.

796
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:46,860
So much easier to blame me,
wasn't it?

797
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:49,560
And say that if I hadn't
screamed that night,

798
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,300
you'd still have your legs.

799
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:54,670
Well, now I have proof.

800
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:58,840
That's enough, Thad.

801
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,780
Dear Sid, you think?

802
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:06,950
You know, even before the
accident, you belittled me.

803
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:10,150
Don't make me
throw you outta here, Thad.

804
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,380
You don't need
to make a scene.

805
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:14,020
Oh, brother,

806
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,560
the scene
has only just begun.

807
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:21,830
Ask that if you can
throw me out.

808
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:22,860
What?

809
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:24,230
Ask the ball
if you're man enough

810
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:25,630
to throw me
out of this room.

811
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:31,510
Let me spoil it for you.

812
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:43,320
Outlook not so good.

813
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:49,790
I've come here during the
season of giving to give you...

814
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:55,360
what you deserve.

815
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,810
Run!

816
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:54,850
Oh, my God! No!

817
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:57,320
No! No!

818
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:13,810
Help!

819
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:15,670
Somebody!

820
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,080
Help me!

821
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,580
You can't go crying to
other people all the time.

822
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:26,050
What sin best befits you,
Father? Hmm?

823
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:27,720
I'll give you anything.

824
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:29,720
Money.

825
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,590
The company.
You want the company?

826
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:33,490
There it is.

827
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:36,960
Greed.

828
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,530
Do you honestly think

829
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:43,640
all this material
you've accumulated

830
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,040
amounts to actual power?

831
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:52,510
This is power.

832
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:55,750
More than you ever had.

833
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,550
More than anyone has.

834
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:03,220
There is one more powerful.

835
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:07,390
The wizard
found his champion.

836
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:13,360
Kill the champion before he
learns his true potential,

837
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:16,530
or he will defeat you.

838
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,640
Show me where to find him.

839
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:35,020
Oh, Greed,

840
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:38,060
you can have him.

841
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:40,360
No.

842
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,560
No. Oh, no!

843
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:47,900
No! No! No!

844
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:09,820
<i>Family is more than just a word.</i>

845
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:14,030
<i>At Sivana Industries,
our focus is family.</i>

846
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,120
Uh, Burke.

847
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,090
Where's the truck?

848
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,170
I can hear it.

849
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,210
Oh, my God!

850
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:07,710
My truck!

851
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:09,480
- My truck!
- Are you kidding?

852
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:12,490
You know, guys,

853
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:14,520
I don't think
that's gonna buff out.

854
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,460
Hey.

855
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,670
Making the crippled kid
do the dirty work. Wow!

856
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:28,730
I'm a better lookout.
I can play innocent.

857
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:31,040
And I can't?

858
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,870
Your face gives off
a very strong vibe

859
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:34,770
of someone who's
hatching schemes.

860
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:37,380
- My face? This face?
- Yeah. Yeah.

861
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,580
Okay.

862
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:46,480
You boys got a hall pass?

863
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:48,960
Oh, us? Yeah. Always.

864
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:50,860
You!

865
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:55,190
You look like you're
up to something.

866
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:56,560
Me? Up to something?

867
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,660
No. Never am I up
to something.

868
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:01,870
Our dad's picking us up.
He got held up at the...

869
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:03,800
The business office.

870
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,640
The business office, huh?

871
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:07,370
Sure, kid.

872
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:09,310
Look, parents or guardians

873
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:12,910
must appear physically
to check out students.

874
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:14,950
Gotcha.

875
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:16,950
Okay, well,
you hear that, Dad?

876
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:18,350
- Hey!
- Shazam!

877
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:20,250
Well, hey there, son,

878
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:22,120
and hey there,
other son that I also have

879
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,190
that's related to that son
I just passed in the hallway.

880
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:28,900
I'm so sorry I'm late.
I got held up at the business office,

881
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:31,330
doing all the work stuff.

882
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:35,070
This is the security guard
all the kids admire so much.

883
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:36,430
Oh.

884
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,970
Actually, that's the other one.
This one sucks.

885
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:40,040
That's not funny.

886
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:43,170
I'm gonna talk to him
about that. I apologize.

887
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,880
Anyway, this is me
appearing physically

888
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,710
to check my sons
out of school.

889
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:50,820
So, thank you so much for keeping 'em
safe, Detective Moron.

890
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:55,850
It's Moran.

891
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:57,760
- You ready?
- Algebra!

892
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:00,190
Science!

893
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:02,560
English!

894
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:05,760
Health!

895
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,810
Oh. Oh.

896
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:39,890
Are you okay?

897
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:19,310
I'm sorry!

898
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,160
More powerful
than a locomotive.

899
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,500
Locomotive. What are you?
An old prospector?

900
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,070
Can leap tall buildings
in a single bound.

901
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:55,140
Single bound.

902
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,410
Oh!

903
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:00,610
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

904
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:01,780
I'm sorry, people. Hi.

905
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:02,980
- Your phone's charged.
- Wow!

906
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:04,750
Your phone's charged.

907
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:06,750
Your phone's charged.

908
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:09,290
You really need like a mic drop
catchphrase after you do some cool shit.

909
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:10,860
I've been thinking
about that.

910
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:12,660
What about this?

911
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,860
"That's why you don't mess with electricity."

912
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:16,990
Catchphrases obviously aren't
one of your superpowers.

913
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,600
And your phone's charged.

914
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,370
- Well, you think you can do better?
- What the hell?

915
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:23,440
Let there be light.

916
01:00:26,770 --> 01:00:29,010
Yeah, yeah, baby.
Yeah, baby, okay.

917
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:35,580
How do I... Never mind.

918
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:36,780
Shazam!

919
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:41,520
Shazam!

920
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:52,300
What'd you see?
What'd you see? Were there boobies?

921
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,530
You see nipples?
Why aren't you talking?

922
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:57,540
We're gonna need more money.

923
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:58,900
Why? You were in there
for, like, five minutes.

924
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,410
Dude, they were
very convincing!

925
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:06,910
Oh, get it, get it!

926
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,280
Go, go, go!

927
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:16,890
No!

928
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:18,890
Stop! No!

929
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:20,130
- I'm not even looking!
- Stop!

930
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:22,290
- I'm not even looking! Oh!
- Stop!

931
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:24,400
- Why?
- Oh, and done!

932
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,930
Finished him.

933
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,340
A lair.

934
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:32,400
Yes.

935
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,070
And obviously,
we're gonna have to

936
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:35,720
- be making this purchase anonymously.
- Mmm.

937
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:37,140
Obviously.

938
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:39,910
And, um, if you have
a location on a cliff.

939
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:41,650
Like a castle-esque
type thing.

940
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:43,280
- Overlooking some water.
- Overlooking some water,

941
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,350
seas, below it.
Rough, you know...

942
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:46,850
Like a waterfall,

943
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:48,890
- so you can drive into...
- Waterfall, yeah. If you... Yeah.

944
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:51,520
Look, Maximum Voltage,
is it?

945
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:53,460
You can call me Max.

946
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,560
Look, Max, why don't you
just start with

947
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:57,090
how many bedrooms
you're looking for?

948
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,500
- One!
- Seven.

949
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:59,600
- One?
- Seven?

950
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,240
What, am I running
a foster home now?

951
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:15,380
Have you seen the one where
he throws the football into space?

952
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:16,850
So dope.

953
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:18,350
Hey, you guys gotta wonder
who's filming those, right?

954
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:20,750
I mean, that's bravery
in and of itself.

955
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:22,150
I mean, is it, though?

956
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,490
Yeah. I'd actually argue
maybe even more brave.

957
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,660
Holding a camera?

958
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:28,560
Staring in the face of danger.

959
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:30,060
Like some weirdo fanboy.

960
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:32,800
Hey, Freeman.

961
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,600
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

962
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,670
What, is your bestie gonna hit
us with a wheelchair this time?

963
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,300
No, maybe not him,
but I have another best friend

964
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:41,190
who might hunt you down
and destroy both of you.

965
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:43,740
Okay, Freddy.

966
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:46,340
You may have heard of him.
The Human Power Storm.

967
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:48,810
Frequency Flinger.
Sir Zaps-A-Lot.

968
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:50,680
Yeah. He's a man
of many names.

969
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,880
You know
the Red Cyclone?

970
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,550
You? My ass you do.

971
01:02:54,550 --> 01:02:56,490
Oh, we're a lot closer
than you think.

972
01:02:56,490 --> 01:02:58,720
Maybe even at this
very moment.

973
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:00,360
Prove it.

974
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,890
I will, tomorrow.
Tomorrow he's gonna come to lunch.

975
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,760
Right, right, Billy?

976
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:07,030
Oh, yeah, and then Superman's gonna
be bringing us dessert, right?

977
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,100
Tomorrow at lunch.
You'll see.

978
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:15,410
And when he doesn't show,
then we'll kick your ass.

979
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:21,850
So, wait, my identity's a secret
so no one I know can get hurt.

980
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:24,780
Except when it makes you look
cool, then it's all good.

981
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:26,420
Billy, it's not like
they're supervillains.

982
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:28,490
They're just super douchebags.

983
01:03:28,490 --> 01:03:31,020
So, you're breaking
your own rule?

984
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:32,690
Got it.

985
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:36,530
This thing is as
much as mine as it is yours.

986
01:03:36,530 --> 01:03:39,260
Starting to think
you think it's all your thing.

987
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:41,570
Billy, you're still
gonna do it, though, right?

988
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:43,970
I mean, what would a good brother do?

989
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,040
All hands on deck.

990
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:53,310
Thank you for this family.
Thank you for this day.

991
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:57,020
Thank you for this food.
Sorry Billy's hand's on vacay.

992
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:03,860
Big news in Philly.
Got a costumed hero.

993
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:05,090
He's doing good.

994
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:07,130
Yeah,
but is he, though?

995
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:10,090
Ooh! Controversy. Into it.

996
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:13,460
Share with us
your perspective, Eugene.

997
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:16,430
Just saying, he's what?
Charging people's phones?

998
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,570
So what?
I can charge a phone with a plug.

999
01:04:19,570 --> 01:04:20,570
Preach.

1000
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:24,070
Pedro, any thoughts?

1001
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,110
Costume's stupid.

1002
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:27,840
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1003
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:29,480
Big white cape like he's
getting married or something.

1004
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:31,950
What if he didn't get
to pick his costume?

1005
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:34,150
Ever think about that?

1006
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:35,890
You're a specialist, Freddy.
What do you think?

1007
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:40,160
Yeah, Freddy,
let's manage to see the positive.

1008
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,160
Okay, well,
I think it looks like

1009
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,430
he doesn't have gratitude
for what he's been given.

1010
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:46,970
Very specific.
All right.

1011
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:48,370
Maybe to the superhero,

1012
01:04:48,370 --> 01:04:50,030
gratitude doesn't mean
having to be clingy.

1013
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:51,400
Clingy?
Wow, interesting take.

1014
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,700
You know,
maybe sometimes

1015
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:55,670
a superhero just wants
a little me time.

1016
01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:57,810
You know, me time
could also be construed

1017
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,080
as pushing away his family.

1018
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,880
Family. Is that what
they are now?

1019
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,010
It's a classic symptom
of "Superhero Syndrome."

1020
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:06,720
Coined by German psychologist
Heinrich Von German-something,

1021
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:10,120
where superpowers become
an all-consuming narcotic.

1022
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:13,360
Son, we're still
eating dinner.

1023
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,230
What he needs is a sidekick.

1024
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:17,800
Name one cool sidekick.

1025
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:20,200
Darla, why are you
so quiet over there, baby?

1026
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,330
You're never at a loss
for words.

1027
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:24,200
I'm eating.

1028
01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:36,650
Why am I still doing this?

1029
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:39,250
Well,
you can't skip every day.

1030
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,350
Not at your age.

1031
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:43,720
But I'm not your age anymore.

1032
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,020
But I can go with you.

1033
01:05:45,030 --> 01:05:47,530
We just gotta trick the guard
out, you know?

1034
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:49,490
Billy, where are you going?

1035
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,030
You're still gonna have
lunch with me, right?

1036
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,660
Billy!

1037
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:57,030
Sir Zaps-A-Lot's still gonna
eat in the cafeteria, right?

1038
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:07,340
All right.

1039
01:06:07,350 --> 01:06:09,080
Did you check it to...

1040
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:12,920
People typically give me
a little money, you know...

1041
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,490
You're a sweet couple.
You guys have a good day.

1042
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:27,360
Ooh!

1043
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:30,230
- Oh, my God.
- Mary, are you okay?

1044
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,540
How do you know my name?

1045
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:34,370
Uh... How do I know
your name? Uh...

1046
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:37,170
One of my superpowers
is name guessing.

1047
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:38,980
Which is really weird, I bet.

1048
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:41,680
Uh, it's not as cool as
super-strength or super-speed,

1049
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:44,680
but it's really helpful
when I meet new people.

1050
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:45,950
Are you hurt?

1051
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:49,860
No, I'm okay. Thank you. Um...

1052
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:54,260
I just need a second to think.

1053
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,560
This has been
such a weird day.

1054
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:00,060
Um, using my powers
of super-observation,

1055
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:02,700
I see that you're holding
a letter from a college

1056
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:03,870
in your hand.

1057
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:06,540
Are you upset
because you didn't get in?

1058
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:11,150
I got in.

1059
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:15,980
Well, now my superpowers are failing me

1060
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:17,750
and I am very confused.

1061
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:21,420
Yeah. Me, too.

1062
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:23,420
I don't know.
I know I should be excited

1063
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:26,390
'cause this is my dream and I've
worked really, really hard for this,

1064
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:28,400
but it's like...

1065
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:33,400
I don't know. Leaving my family
does not feel fun, you know?

1066
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,530
Could I give you a little piece of advice?

1067
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:38,440
Don't be worried
about everybody else.

1068
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,370
Always look out
for number one.

1069
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:41,770
Gandhi said that.

1070
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:43,710
- I don't think he said that.
- Yeah, he did.

1071
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:45,180
- Gandhi did not say...
- Somebody like Gandhi said that.

1072
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:46,640
"Take care of number one."

1073
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:48,280
It was a really wise...
It might've been Yoda.

1074
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,950
- Listen.
- I'm sorry, no.

1075
01:07:49,950 --> 01:07:52,520
Agree to disagree.
The point is, you do you, you know?

1076
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,020
You gotta look out for you.

1077
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:56,290
And get as far away
from this place as you can.

1078
01:07:58,420 --> 01:07:59,890
I don't know if I want to.

1079
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:01,730
Of course you do.
What're you gonna do?

1080
01:08:01,730 --> 01:08:03,970
You gonna live in a group home
for the rest of your life?

1081
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:06,930
Look, families are for people

1082
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:09,370
who can't take care
of themselves, okay? So...

1083
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,400
And you can take care
of yourself.

1084
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:14,780
Also, look both ways when you cross the street.

1085
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:21,780
I'll just call him.
I'll just make sure.

1086
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:26,550
It's ringing.

1087
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:31,660
Red Cyclone, hey!
Hey, what's going on?

1088
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:33,360
Oh, that's crazy!
Yeah, it's Freddy, by the way.

1089
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:36,060
Yeah, it's crazy!
Great story.

1090
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:38,800
He's not talking to anyone.

1091
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,730
I was!

1092
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:43,500
I was! We're friends.
I know him, I do!

1093
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,740
I know him! I know him!
Uh, yeah.

1094
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:50,580
Shit.

1095
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:56,110
Come on now.

1096
01:08:56,110 --> 01:08:59,350
<i>♪ Hands! Lightning with my hands! ♪</i>

1097
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:01,490
<i>♪ Lightning with my hands! ♪</i>

1098
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:03,720
<i>♪ Lightning with my hands! ♪</i>

1099
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:05,420
Hey. Hey.

1100
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:07,390
Hey, young man!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1101
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:09,530
What are you doing?
I'm in the middle of a show right now.

1102
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:11,230
How can I help you?

1103
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,930
I just wanted to say thank you
for showing up to lunch today.

1104
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:16,970
Yeah, I got a little something called
a, uh, suitcase wedgie, right?

1105
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:18,740
I don't know if
you've ever heard of it,

1106
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:21,040
but it's when someone grabs
your underwear like that

1107
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,080
and holds you like a suitcase,
walks you down the hallway.

1108
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,810
And this was my underwear.

1109
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:30,650
Gross.

1110
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:32,080
You said you'd come.

1111
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:34,290
You said I would come!
I never said I was...

1112
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:35,690
I'm a superhero, dude!

1113
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:37,520
Well, you're acting
real heroic.

1114
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,060
How much people
paying you today?

1115
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:42,230
Listen, I have serious
responsibilities now, okay?

1116
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:44,790
But that's cool because I can
carry that burden with my...

1117
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:47,700
<i>♪ Hands! Lightning with my hands! ♪</i>

1118
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:08,420
Oh, man!

1119
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:14,900
Holy moly.

1120
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:20,260
Don't move! Nobody move!

1121
01:10:28,410 --> 01:10:29,670
Oh, no, no!

Oh, no, no, no!

01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,820
Oh, that looked like it hurt.

1125
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:47,590
It's him!
It's that superhero guy!

1126
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:50,530
Help us! Save us!

1127
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Come on!

1128
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,600
Come on... Yeah.

1129
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,870
What's he doing?
What's going on?

1130
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:08,720
No way.

1131
01:11:16,490 --> 01:11:19,320
Oh, no, no.
Please don't make me do this.

1132
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:20,690
God, this is
the worst idea ever!

1133
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:34,270
I did it! I did it!

1134
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:36,510
I got the bus! I got the bus.

1135
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:38,340
Nobody move in there.

1136
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:40,740
Oh, I gotta put this thing down.
I gotta put this thing down.

1137
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:42,980
Oh!

1138
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:45,980
Oh.

1139
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:48,150
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Doggy, doggy, you have to move.

1140
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:49,850
Move! Move! Shoo! Shoo!

1141
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:51,790
Please be a good dog,
good dog!

1142
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:53,390
You're being a bad dog!

1143
01:11:53,390 --> 01:11:55,730
Go! Go!

1144
01:11:55,730 --> 01:11:58,160
Please go. Please move.

1145
01:11:58,170 --> 01:12:00,600
Yes, thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

1146
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,830
Thank you.

1147
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:20,990
Yeah. Yeah, no, no, no, no.

1148
01:12:20,990 --> 01:12:23,150
I was in the neighborhood,
you know, so I thought...

1149
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,290
Thank you!

1150
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:26,560
It was kind of
my fault anyway.

1151
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:32,700
So, it seems Philadelphia has
gotten an early Christmas present

1152
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:36,600
in the form of its
very own superhero.

1153
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,370
And we're out.

1154
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:40,170
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, of course, yeah.

1155
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:43,070
Dude! Dude, dude!
Dude, did you see that?

1156
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:46,410
Yeah. You electrocuted a bus
and almost killed these people.

1157
01:12:46,410 --> 01:12:48,610
And then I caught it!

1158
01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:51,750
Freddy, I caught a bus
with my bare hands, man!

1159
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:53,750
I caught a bus
like people catch fly balls.

1160
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:55,320
Like, who does that?
I do that!

1161
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,690
Billy! You do nothing.

1162
01:12:56,690 --> 01:13:00,120
You take selfies
and make people pay you.

1163
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:03,630
You know, forget it. I can't really
talk to you when you look like this.

1164
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:05,600
You just wish it was you.

1165
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:07,500
No shit!

1166
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:11,470
You think?
I would kill to have what you have.

1167
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,370
Because everything I do
is, like,

1168
01:13:13,370 --> 01:13:16,470
some desperate attempt
to get people to notice me.

1169
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:18,380
To not feel sorry for me.

1170
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:21,850
I mean, look at me! Look at me.
Do you even see me?

1171
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:26,520
'Cause most people don't.
'Cause they don't want to.

1172
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,720
And now you don't either.

1173
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:30,850
I mean, you think
this is who you are?

1174
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:32,560
I mean, Billy, you're 14,

1175
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:35,460
and now you're no better
than the Breyers.

1176
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:37,630
All this power,
and all you did

1177
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:39,600
was turn into a show-off
and a bully.

1178
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:43,500
Whatever, kid!

1179
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:44,940
I do what I want!

1180
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:49,180
And I'm, like,
mid-20s probably!

1181
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:52,010
Maybe even, like, 30.

1182
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:56,680
Chosen one.

1183
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:02,590
The so-called perfect man.

1184
01:14:03,790 --> 01:14:05,160
Pure of heart.

1185
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,130
Flawless in every way.

1186
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,330
What made you so worthy?

1187
01:14:12,330 --> 01:14:14,700
I'm sorry, can I help...

1188
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,170
Do you want an autograph
or something?

1189
01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:17,870
Give me your power.

1190
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,370
Or die.

1191
01:14:21,370 --> 01:14:24,580
Oh, snap! You're, like,
a bad guy, right?

1192
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:28,050
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
Before this gets really stupid for you,

1193
01:14:28,050 --> 01:14:30,410
you should know that
I'm basically invincible.

1194
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:41,460
The weapons of man
draw no blood from our kind.

1195
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:44,160
I said, stop right there!

1196
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:46,100
The only thing
that extinguishes magic...

1197
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,400
is magic.

1198
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:52,170
Time to transfer
your power to me.

1199
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:58,370
Oh, you did not see that one
coming, did you, grandpa?

1200
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:00,380
Them's street rules.

1201
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:11,050
Okay, okay, okay.

1202
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:12,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1203
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,990
I never should've punched you
in the nuts like that.

1204
01:15:14,990 --> 01:15:16,030
That was totally my bad.

1205
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:17,530
We can talk about this.

1206
01:15:17,530 --> 01:15:19,000
You grovel like a child.

1207
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,100
That's because I am one.
I'm a kid!

1208
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:22,840
You don't wanna hurt a kid,
do you?

1209
01:15:25,670 --> 01:15:28,810
I believe I can fly!
I believe I can fly, I can fly!

1210
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:30,370
Freddy said if I believe
I can fly, then I can fly.

1211
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:32,540
So I believe!
I believe! I believe!

1212
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:33,510
Okay.

1213
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:34,650
Superman!

1214
01:15:34,650 --> 01:15:36,910
Superman! What arm is it?

1215
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,580
Why am I not flying?

1216
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:40,190
Please, I don't wanna die!

1217
01:16:02,610 --> 01:16:04,440
I'm floating!

1218
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,920
What the hell
was that?

1219
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:19,660
I can fly!

1220
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:26,100
Billy?

1221
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:29,570
Freddy! I need your help!

1222
01:16:29,570 --> 01:16:31,500
You can fly?

1223
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,380
Who's the other guy?

1224
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:41,780
Santa!

1225
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:48,820
So, like, what do you and Mrs.
Claus do in the summertime?

1226
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:51,290
Well, in some ways,

1227
01:16:51,290 --> 01:16:53,390
Santa is always here for you.

1228
01:17:00,230 --> 01:17:01,870
Help Santa!

1229
01:17:01,870 --> 01:17:04,700
Santa needs help! Help!

1230
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:06,240
Give us a shout
if you need us.

1231
01:17:13,950 --> 01:17:16,470
I'm just gonna chill in here for
a little while, if that's okay.

1232
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:20,680
This is crazy.

1233
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:22,290
This is crazy.
You don't have to fight this guy.

1234
01:17:22,290 --> 01:17:24,660
This isn't your job.
You can run, right?

1235
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:26,960
Yes, you can run. Awesome!

1236
01:17:35,470 --> 01:17:36,870
Get back!

1237
01:17:36,870 --> 01:17:38,400
Get away!

1238
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:42,410
<i>- I'm Batman!</i>
- Get him, Batman!

1239
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,610
Oh, sorry.

1240
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,540
Come on!

1241
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:41,000
Shazam!

1242
01:19:11,130 --> 01:19:12,330
Billy!

1243
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:14,670
Billy!

1244
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,500
Billy, where are you?

1245
01:19:20,610 --> 01:19:21,610
Billy!

1246
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:24,070
Where are you, Billy?

1247
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,180
Billy, come on!

1248
01:19:33,090 --> 01:19:35,990
Billy. Where is he?

1249
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:37,390
Supervillain.

1250
01:19:37,390 --> 01:19:40,290
Supervillain! Supervillain!

1251
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:43,930
Worse. Much worse.

1252
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:47,530
Radioactive anthromorph?
Psychic energy manipulator?

1253
01:19:47,530 --> 01:19:50,930
I won't let you read my mind.
My mind is blank. You can't get in.

1254
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:53,270
I don't need to read
your mind.

1255
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:54,910
Because you are
going to tell me.

1256
01:19:55,910 --> 01:19:57,340
Where is he?

1257
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:11,820
Oh, my God,
honey, are you okay?

1258
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:13,660
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1259
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:15,590
What happened?
Are you hurt?

1260
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,560
Come inside.

1261
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,800
We need
to have a talk.

1262
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,100
Just don't be
so hard on him, okay?

1263
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:29,640
Running out on us! Lying!

1264
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,370
Huh? Then I get a call
from the school,

1265
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:33,510
telling me
you've been cutting class!

1266
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:34,840
Getting in fights!

1267
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:41,050
<i>Bill, the man saved nine people.</i>

1268
01:20:41,050 --> 01:20:43,020
Whoa! Is that...

1269
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:44,390
<i>I'm questioning his motive.</i>

1270
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:47,460
What's Freddy doing
with a superhero?

1271
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:54,230
Or what's a superhero
doing with Freddy?

1272
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:58,940
You remember dinner,

1273
01:20:58,940 --> 01:21:00,970
when Billy and Freddy
were arguing

1274
01:21:00,970 --> 01:21:03,970
like an old married couple,
like this?

1275
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:06,540
When he rescued me,
he knew I lived in a group home.

1276
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:08,980
He knew my name.
He called me Mary.

1277
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:20,920
Wait, are you saying Billy's
the Human Power Storm?

1278
01:21:20,930 --> 01:21:22,830
Yes! You guys figured it out!

1279
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:24,260
All on your own.
I didn't help.

1280
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:27,000
- I didn't break any promises.
- You knew?

1281
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,600
I'm a good sister!

1282
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:35,240
I mean,
what were you thinking?

1283
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:37,280
And then you bring
Freddy into it.

1284
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:46,220
Give him some space, guys.
He's a little upset, okay?

1285
01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:57,260
Billy?

1286
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:03,640
You're him.

1287
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:06,170
You're the hero.

1288
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:09,210
Yeah, well,
not anymore, so...

1289
01:22:14,110 --> 01:22:16,480
Why do you have my notebook?

1290
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:20,150
Eugene finished your search.

1291
01:22:21,050 --> 01:22:23,390
Look, I'm not a hacker, okay?

1292
01:22:23,390 --> 01:22:25,720
But I have played
<i>Watch Dogs</i> and <i>Uplink.</i>

1293
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:28,860
And maybe I did pick up a few
skills, which maybe did get me

1294
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:31,130
into federal databases
most people can't get into.

1295
01:22:31,130 --> 01:22:33,300
Good for you,
but I'm gonna go.

1296
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:37,270
Your parents' names
are Marilyn and C.C. Batson.

1297
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:43,840
What?

1298
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,740
You were born
in Zumbrota, Minnesota.

1299
01:22:45,740 --> 01:22:47,580
They divorced
when you were three.

1300
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:49,450
Your mom moved here
that year.

1301
01:22:49,450 --> 01:22:51,780
Twenty months later,
you got lost.

1302
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:53,550
You never found them

1303
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:55,890
'cause your dad's been in
prison in Florida for ten years.

1304
01:22:55,890 --> 01:22:57,260
And your mom's...

1305
01:22:58,930 --> 01:23:00,130
What?

1306
01:23:01,730 --> 01:23:03,330
Is she dead?

1307
01:23:03,330 --> 01:23:05,230
She's two subway stops away.

1308
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:08,300
What?

1309
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:11,740
You know, you didn't find her because
she reverted to her maiden name.

1310
01:23:16,010 --> 01:23:18,180
Hey, Billy! Billy!

1311
01:23:21,810 --> 01:23:23,450
- Victor, get the keys.
- I got it.

1312
01:23:23,450 --> 01:23:25,680
Kids, stay here
in case Billy comes back.

1313
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,290
Come on. Inside, let's go.

1314
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:46,370
Wait. I thought
we were running after Billy.

1315
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:49,340
No, we're gonna
wait here for now.

1316
01:23:52,910 --> 01:23:54,310
Billy?

1317
01:23:56,810 --> 01:23:57,820
Freddy?

1318
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,420
Oh, how quaint.

1319
01:24:07,290 --> 01:24:09,260
Actually, I take that back.

1320
01:24:11,230 --> 01:24:13,400
What a shithole.

1321
01:24:56,070 --> 01:24:57,640
Just a second.

1322
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,050
Hey, look, I'm late
for work already, all right?

1323
01:25:04,050 --> 01:25:06,850
We don't need any magazines or whatever.
Thanks, though.

1324
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:08,490
Oh, I'm not.

1325
01:25:08,490 --> 01:25:10,960
You probably
don't recognize me...

1326
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:14,290
but I found my way home.

1327
01:25:15,630 --> 01:25:16,630
Mom.

1328
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:19,730
It's me.

1329
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:22,230
Oh, God.

1330
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:24,470
Is it?

1331
01:25:27,310 --> 01:25:29,540
Um... Hang on.

1332
01:25:30,470 --> 01:25:31,980
Who's at the door?

1333
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:35,180
It's, um...

1334
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:37,280
It's no one, Travis.

1335
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:43,620
That wasn't Dad, was it?

1336
01:25:44,590 --> 01:25:46,460
No.

1337
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:49,300
Listen, um...

1338
01:25:51,130 --> 01:25:52,430
It's really you, huh?

1339
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:59,070
I didn't mean to run away.
You know that, right?

1340
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:02,110
I let go, but it was
by accident.

1341
01:26:02,110 --> 01:26:03,880
Yeah, no. I know, yeah.

1342
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:06,050
I saw you.

1343
01:26:07,210 --> 01:26:08,480
What?

1344
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:13,320
I saw you after.

1345
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:19,860
So, it was never your fault.

1346
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:24,630
Look, I was 17, okay?
And my daddy kicked me out.

1347
01:26:24,630 --> 01:26:28,630
And your dad just decided
not to be a part of anything.

1348
01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:32,810
<i>And I was hurting,
and I was screwed up.</i>

1349
01:26:35,110 --> 01:26:36,910
- I want the tiger.
- I know.

1350
01:26:36,910 --> 01:26:38,540
I know, honey,

1351
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:41,480
but Mom's not exactly
going pro here, okay?

1352
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:45,350
Billy?

1353
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:46,820
Billy!

1354
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:49,020
Billy?

1355
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:52,020
Jesus Christ.
Billy, this isn't funny!

1356
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:53,660
Here you go, buddy.

1357
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:56,890
That should warm you up.
Is that better?

1358
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:02,570
<i>Look, it's just once
I saw you with the police,</i>

1359
01:27:02,570 --> 01:27:04,730
<i>I realized that they could do</i>

1360
01:27:04,740 --> 01:27:07,640
<i>a better job taking care
of you than I ever will.</i>

1361
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:14,650
But you're good, right?

1362
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:19,020
I mean,
you landed on your feet.

1363
01:27:19,020 --> 01:27:21,020
Because, I mean,
you look real good.

1364
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:24,520
It's just...

1365
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:30,030
now is not a really good time
for me, Bill.

1366
01:27:34,130 --> 01:27:39,370
All I wanted to do is
let you know I'm doing good,

1367
01:27:40,810 --> 01:27:43,980
but I have to get back
to my real family.

1368
01:27:46,110 --> 01:27:47,110
Here.

1369
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:52,620
What's this?

1370
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:55,820
Marilyn! What's goin' on out there?

1371
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:57,690
You might need it
more than me.

1372
01:28:15,210 --> 01:28:17,940
Freddy, you were right.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1373
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:21,480
<i>Come home, Billy.
Come home.</i>

1374
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:25,580
<i>Billy! Supervillain! Supervillain!</i>

1375
01:28:41,530 --> 01:28:42,770
Shazam!

1376
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:59,150
Who are you? What do you want?

1377
01:28:59,150 --> 01:29:00,750
What do I want?

1378
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:02,760
I want...

1379
01:29:07,490 --> 01:29:08,730
That.

1380
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,060
Whoa.

1381
01:29:14,430 --> 01:29:16,230
Kick his ass, Billy!

1382
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,340
Yes, Billy.

1383
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:22,910
Try it, by all means.

1384
01:29:22,910 --> 01:29:25,010
Let them go
and I'll come inside.

1385
01:29:25,010 --> 01:29:27,280
No, first, you come inside,

1386
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:28,880
then maybe I'll let them go.

1387
01:29:45,970 --> 01:29:47,570
Good boy.

1388
01:29:50,030 --> 01:29:52,200
Because that's all you are,
isn't it?

1389
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:54,270
How old are you?

1390
01:29:54,270 --> 01:29:56,710
- Basically 15.
- Hmm.

1391
01:29:58,510 --> 01:30:02,510
When I was a child,
the old man told me I wasn't good enough.

1392
01:30:02,510 --> 01:30:06,450
Yet here you are, a coward.

1393
01:30:06,450 --> 01:30:10,990
Run from me and the wizard chooses you?
You're not a hero.

1394
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:14,720
But I'm gonna give you
the opportunity to be one.

1395
01:30:14,730 --> 01:30:16,560
Give me the power
of the champion.

1396
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:17,930
No. Don't do it, Billy.

1397
01:30:34,710 --> 01:30:37,350
Give me the power
and I'll let them go.

1398
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:39,180
Darla, no.

1399
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:41,180
Don't go, Billy.

1400
01:30:41,190 --> 01:30:43,290
- Don't go, Billy.
- Darla, come here.

1401
01:30:43,290 --> 01:30:45,220
No, I have to.

1402
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:48,290
It's what a good brother
would do. Right?

1403
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:54,570
Billy.

1404
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:23,730
I dedicated my life to getting here.

1405
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:26,760
I scoured the earth.

1406
01:31:26,770 --> 01:31:28,160
No one believed me.

1407
01:31:28,170 --> 01:31:30,870
No one helped.

1408
01:31:30,870 --> 01:31:32,600
Not the wizard.

1409
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:34,870
Not my family.

1410
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:38,940
I only had myself.

1411
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:40,140
I get it.

1412
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:43,220
I get what that's like.

1413
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:47,150
Feeling like
you're all alone in the world.

1414
01:31:47,150 --> 01:31:48,880
Stand.

1415
01:31:48,890 --> 01:31:51,120
Feeling like there's that one thing,
and if you could just find it,

1416
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,360
then you'd finally
be good enough.

1417
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:54,360
Stand.

1418
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,400
The champion's name.

1419
01:32:00,330 --> 01:32:01,330
Say it.

1420
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:30,430
Look, no offense, mister,

1421
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:32,960
but I don't think these things
have your best interest at heart.

1422
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:36,330
Don't listen to this child.

1423
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:39,070
Take the staff.

1424
01:32:39,070 --> 01:32:44,010
Hold it and say the champion's name.

1425
01:32:44,010 --> 01:32:46,140
They're using you.

1426
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:48,750
You have to see that,
that they are using you.

1427
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:50,080
Say your name.

1428
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:54,480
His name...

1429
01:32:55,650 --> 01:32:57,550
is Captain Sparklefingers.

1430
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:59,960
And we're gonna keep
throwing things at your big,

1431
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:01,990
fat, ugly-eyed head,

1432
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:04,100
until you let our brother go.

1433
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:30,620
Boy, am I glad
I didn't sell that Batarang.

1434
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:32,820
- Pedro, is that a lamp?
- It's an ugly one.

1435
01:33:32,820 --> 01:33:34,620
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1436
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:36,290
Guys,
I appreciate the thought,

1437
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:38,030
I really do, but I don't think
your weapons are gonna help.

1438
01:33:38,030 --> 01:33:39,860
You can put 'em down now.

1439
01:33:41,370 --> 01:33:42,330
The door was right here.

1440
01:33:42,330 --> 01:33:44,230
Billy, how do we
get outta here?

1441
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:45,740
What, you think I know?
I don't know.

1442
01:33:46,770 --> 01:33:47,700
This way!

1443
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:49,170
Go, go, go. Follow Darla.

1444
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:51,270
Good job, Darla. Go, go, go!

1445
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:52,280
Kids?

1446
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:55,480
Why is this open?

1447
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:57,780
Freddy? Mary?

1448
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:02,720
Pedro, Pedro, come on.

1449
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,620
Freddy? Freddy, keep up.

1450
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:06,130
Darla, stay in front.

1451
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:08,060
We gotta hurry.

1452
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:32,980
Whoa!

1453
01:34:33,820 --> 01:34:36,050
So many doors.

1454
01:34:36,050 --> 01:34:38,950
One of these has to be
a way out, right?

1455
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:40,390
Yeah, I would hope so.

1456
01:34:57,410 --> 01:34:58,440
Not this one.

1457
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,460
Okay, no more doors.
Nobody open any more doors.

1458
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:16,660
Come on, Billy.
What are we gonna do?

1459
01:35:16,660 --> 01:35:18,160
Darla, I don't know.

1460
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:20,090
Yes, you do. Just think.
How'd you get out last time?

1461
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:22,430
Uh, last time, I thought about the
subway, and I was on the subway.

1462
01:35:22,430 --> 01:35:24,430
Okay. Then, Billy, look,
think about the subway.

1463
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:27,170
Think about any place
except for here, okay?

1464
01:35:49,430 --> 01:35:50,890
Come on, come on, come on.

1465
01:35:50,890 --> 01:35:52,400
Why are you covering my eyes?

1466
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:55,160
Really? This is the first
place you think of? Wow!

1467
01:35:55,170 --> 01:35:56,500
You're welcome!

1468
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:58,070
Why can't I see what's inside?

1469
01:35:58,070 --> 01:35:59,500
You are not old enough.

1470
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:01,640
Old enough to know
that was great music.

1471
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:03,470
Not my thing.

1472
01:36:03,470 --> 01:36:04,470
Where's Freddy?

1473
01:36:04,470 --> 01:36:05,980
Yeah, you, too, Sriracha.

1474
01:36:05,980 --> 01:36:07,680
Hey, have a holly
jolly Christmas.

1475
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,980
Freddy! What are you doing?

1476
01:36:08,980 --> 01:36:10,550
Nice people.

1477
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:11,980
Nice people? Come on.

1478
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:13,550
Is that glitter? They have glitter!
Can I get glitter?

1479
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:14,780
No, not from them.

1480
01:36:14,790 --> 01:36:15,880
Please?

1481
01:36:15,890 --> 01:36:16,820
No.

1482
01:36:18,790 --> 01:36:20,060
Darla.

1483
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:26,760
Go, go, go. Everybody, go!

1484
01:36:26,770 --> 01:36:28,330
Freddy? Freddy, Freddy.

1485
01:36:28,330 --> 01:36:30,100
One, two, three.
Up, up. Up we go.

1486
01:36:38,180 --> 01:36:39,940
Carnival, go! Go, Mary, go.

1487
01:36:39,940 --> 01:36:41,980
Come on, Pedro. Come on.

1488
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:55,220
Don't run,
but don't walk. Just be cool.

1489
01:36:55,230 --> 01:36:57,790
Act naturally, like kids
naturally act in a carnival.

1490
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:59,760
- He's not gonna look for us here.
- Is that him?

1491
01:36:59,770 --> 01:37:01,700
- Oh, my God!
- Dude, it's Zap-tain America!

1492
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:03,460
- Power Boy!
- He's an impersonator, okay?

1493
01:37:03,470 --> 01:37:05,130
Yeah, I'm an impersonator!
I'm a fake version of myself.

1494
01:37:05,140 --> 01:37:06,170
Don't take pictures.

1495
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:09,440
Shazam!

1496
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:18,150
Hey! Where'd he go?

1497
01:37:18,150 --> 01:37:19,720
What,
is he invisible now?

1498
01:37:26,860 --> 01:37:29,760
Oh, man,
I just spit on a baby!

1499
01:37:31,060 --> 01:37:32,730
Yo, what is that?

1500
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:37,570
Who is that guy?

1501
01:37:38,570 --> 01:37:40,770
Champion.

1502
01:37:42,870 --> 01:37:46,240
You don't deserve that name.

1503
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:48,840
See that?
Look at that up there!

1504
01:37:48,850 --> 01:37:52,750
Hiding behind
innocent people who will now die.

1505
01:37:54,390 --> 01:37:58,290
Because deep down you're still
just a scared little boy.

1506
01:38:00,430 --> 01:38:02,090
Oh, no.

1507
01:38:03,130 --> 01:38:06,030
Run! Run!

1508
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:21,210
- Oh! What do we do?
- Just hold on!

1509
01:38:21,210 --> 01:38:23,110
- To what?
- The bar, you idiot!

1510
01:38:32,090 --> 01:38:34,090
Well, you wanted
me to be a hero.

1511
01:38:34,090 --> 01:38:35,360
Are you kidding?

1512
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,230
Okay, no.
Old guy's up there harboring

1513
01:38:37,230 --> 01:38:39,060
multiple spiritual entities.

1514
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:40,700
Plus, he has
the same powers as you.

1515
01:38:40,700 --> 01:38:42,660
Plus, I mean,
he knows what he's doing.

1516
01:38:42,670 --> 01:38:45,070
Plus, I mean, you're my best friend.
I don't want you to die.

1517
01:38:45,570 --> 01:38:48,470
If a superhero
can't save his family,

1518
01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:50,810
he's not much of a hero.

1519
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:57,080
That was a decent catchphrase.

1520
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,120
Shazam!

1521
01:39:08,130 --> 01:39:09,760
Now, let's try this again.

1522
01:39:24,070 --> 01:39:25,680
Or try that again!

1523
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:34,780
Billy, look out!

1524
01:39:37,790 --> 01:39:40,260
Laser eyes!
Guys, he's got laser eyes!

1525
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:42,590
Too bad your aim sucks balls!

1526
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:53,740
That's his power matrix.

1527
01:39:53,740 --> 01:39:55,100
His what-what?

1528
01:39:55,110 --> 01:39:58,410
When the demon guys leave
his eye, he loses his powers.

1529
01:39:58,410 --> 01:40:00,250
That's why
the Batarang hurt him.

1530
01:40:01,450 --> 01:40:02,210
Hey!

1531
01:40:02,210 --> 01:40:04,510
Over here!

1532
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:06,350
- Wait. What are you doing?
- Trust me. Divide and conquer.

1533
01:40:06,350 --> 01:40:07,950
We separate the Sins
from the eye,

1534
01:40:07,950 --> 01:40:09,320
and he's just an old man.

1535
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:10,820
Gather the mutts.

1536
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:25,700
Run!

1537
01:40:31,510 --> 01:40:33,780
Darla, no!

1538
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:50,390
Here. Take it.

1539
01:40:50,390 --> 01:40:52,360
Take it. It's for you.

1540
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:53,900
Hold it tight.

1541
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:57,130
Close your eyes.
Everything's gonna be okay.

1542
01:40:57,140 --> 01:40:58,840
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1543
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,170
Okay.

1544
01:41:40,940 --> 01:41:41,950
Shazam!

1545
01:42:04,340 --> 01:42:05,900
Shazam!

1546
01:42:10,940 --> 01:42:12,540
Playtime's over, boy.

1547
01:42:13,810 --> 01:42:15,480
Your friends
can't help you anymore.

1548
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:16,810
Shazam!

1549
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:22,690
Hey!

1550
01:42:49,310 --> 01:42:50,520
Shazam!

1551
01:43:15,070 --> 01:43:16,910
Nice trick.

1552
01:43:16,910 --> 01:43:18,370
Catchy.

1553
01:43:18,380 --> 01:43:20,340
One simple word.

1554
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:22,080
I have a better trick.

1555
01:43:23,050 --> 01:43:24,380
Four words.

1556
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:26,780
Kill the little girl.

1557
01:43:26,780 --> 01:43:29,650
- Darla, no!
- Take me instead!

1558
01:43:33,860 --> 01:43:34,890
Stop!

1559
01:43:50,110 --> 01:43:52,970
Billy, there's
one more demon guy in his eye!

1560
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:55,280
You gotta just rip it out
of his face hole!

1561
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:56,510
It's where he gets his power.

1562
01:44:00,950 --> 01:44:02,350
Reach for it.

1563
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:04,920
I dare you.

1564
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,430
Wise decision.

1565
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:19,630
Hands on the staff.

1566
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:21,900
Billy, don't do this. Billy!

1567
01:44:21,910 --> 01:44:23,640
- Billy.
- Don't do it, Billy!

1568
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:24,840
Don't!

1569
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:45,560
<i>Say my name</i>

1570
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:47,700
<i>so my power
may flow through you.</i>

1571
01:44:47,700 --> 01:44:50,870
I open my heart to you,
Billy Batson.

1572
01:44:50,870 --> 01:44:55,270
And in so doing,
choose you as champion.

1573
01:44:55,270 --> 01:44:58,970
With your heart,
unlock your greatest power.

1574
01:44:58,980 --> 01:45:02,010
The thrones of our brothers
and sisters await.

1575
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:11,590
All hands on deck.

1576
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:18,460
Say my name.

1577
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:21,130
Billy!

1578
01:45:21,130 --> 01:45:22,600
No, not my name.

1579
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:24,400
Say the name that I say
to turn into this guy.

1580
01:45:25,170 --> 01:45:26,170
Shazam!

1581
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:06,040
Guys.

1582
01:46:08,010 --> 01:46:09,010
What's happening?

1583
01:46:13,420 --> 01:46:14,820
I can fly!

1584
01:46:19,590 --> 01:46:20,960
Guys.

1585
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:23,190
Check out these guns.

1586
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:27,200
No. It's not possible.

1587
01:46:28,970 --> 01:46:32,200
Gee-whiz, mister.
Sorry I took your cane.

1588
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:33,570
Do you want it back?

1589
01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:37,710
Guys, I don't believe in violence,

1590
01:46:37,710 --> 01:46:41,550
but I think we should kick this guy's
butt, like, really hard.

1591
01:46:46,150 --> 01:46:47,590
Whoa!

1592
01:46:52,890 --> 01:46:54,530
Guys, I think
I can move really...

1593
01:46:55,390 --> 01:46:57,130
fast.

1594
01:46:57,130 --> 01:46:59,130
Hyper-speed! Check!

1595
01:47:08,170 --> 01:47:10,740
Billy! The eye!

1596
01:47:18,350 --> 01:47:19,580
Look out!

1597
01:47:21,650 --> 01:47:22,820
Whoa!

1598
01:47:24,260 --> 01:47:27,490
What?

1599
01:47:27,490 --> 01:47:28,760
- What!
- Dude!

1600
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:31,260
You almost exploded me.

1601
01:48:16,770 --> 01:48:18,770
Dude, I've studied
the fighting techniques

1602
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:20,350
of every single superhero.

1603
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:23,180
What do you got?

1604
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:28,620
Well, that's terrifying.

1605
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:05,090
Enough games, boy.

1606
01:49:05,090 --> 01:49:06,890
You think
a pack of children can...

1607
01:49:10,190 --> 01:49:11,260
Wait, what?

1608
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:13,630
You will beg for mercy

1609
01:49:13,630 --> 01:49:15,800
as I feast on your heart...

1610
01:49:16,430 --> 01:49:17,730
slow.

1611
01:49:19,540 --> 01:49:22,570
Are you making some big evil guy
speech right now or something?

1612
01:49:22,570 --> 01:49:26,280
You're, like, a mile away from me
right now. There's cars and trucks.

1613
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:29,310
I will have the world eating
out of the palm of my hand...

1614
01:49:29,310 --> 01:49:31,950
All I see is mouth moving.
I don't hear any...

1615
01:49:31,950 --> 01:49:35,750
Only I have
the power to unleash...

1616
01:49:37,490 --> 01:49:38,920
Ah, whatever. Screw it.

1617
01:50:09,690 --> 01:50:11,190
Oh, my gosh. Those people!

1618
01:50:19,230 --> 01:50:20,400
Hi!

1619
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:21,830
Wow. I caught you.

1620
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:35,950
I got it. I got it.

1621
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:43,920
Oh, my God. I do got it.

1622
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,640
You're not gonna believe this,

1623
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:03,140
but you're actually the first
villain I've ever fought.

1624
01:51:03,140 --> 01:51:05,140
It's kind of
a huge deal for me.

1625
01:51:19,060 --> 01:51:21,860
Somebody help!

1626
01:51:35,670 --> 01:51:39,640
Hi. Wow. It's really you.

1627
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:42,780
My name is Darla,
and I've been really good.

1628
01:51:42,780 --> 01:51:43,880
What?

1629
01:51:47,780 --> 01:51:49,120
Oh, crap.

1630
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:51,490
No, no, no.

1631
01:51:51,490 --> 01:51:52,490
No, no. No!

1632
01:52:10,510 --> 01:52:12,110
No! No, no.

1633
01:52:20,150 --> 01:52:21,480
Oh, my God!

1634
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:23,190
Is he giving us
suitcase wedgies?

1635
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:03,220
So this is, like,
the Seven Deadly Sins, right?

1636
01:53:03,230 --> 01:53:05,630
I mean, I've never
been great at math,

1637
01:53:05,630 --> 01:53:08,730
but, uh, the big, angry one,
that's Wrath, yeah?

1638
01:53:08,730 --> 01:53:11,630
And then Gluttony, obvi.

1639
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:14,870
Pride, Greed, Sloth, Lust,

1640
01:53:14,870 --> 01:53:19,310
who I thought was gonna be way
hotter, if I'm being honest.

1641
01:53:19,310 --> 01:53:22,440
But that's only six.
Where's lucky number seven?

1642
01:53:22,450 --> 01:53:24,680
Where's little man?
Where's Envy?

1643
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:27,680
Is he just scared of me and my
family because we're so awesome?

1644
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:29,250
Because I get that.

1645
01:53:29,250 --> 01:53:31,350
Like, the other sins,
they get to come out and fight

1646
01:53:31,350 --> 01:53:33,520
because they're big
and strong and scary.

1647
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:34,590
But Envy...

1648
01:53:35,890 --> 01:53:37,460
he's just the runt.

1649
01:53:49,770 --> 01:53:53,070
And that's why all the other sins
never invite him out to play, man.

1650
01:53:53,080 --> 01:53:55,640
Because they all know
who'd win.

1651
01:53:55,650 --> 01:54:01,280
And it's not weak,
worthless, ugly Envy.

1652
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:29,510
Gotcha.

1653
01:54:29,510 --> 01:54:30,510
Shazam!

1654
01:54:37,590 --> 01:54:38,660
Shazam!

1655
01:54:49,230 --> 01:54:51,230
Ready to go round up your buddies?

1656
01:55:20,300 --> 01:55:23,500
No. No!

1657
01:55:53,330 --> 01:55:55,730
Here's the thing about power.

1658
01:55:55,730 --> 01:55:59,700
What good's power,
if you got nobody to share it with?

1659
01:56:01,210 --> 01:56:02,870
- Nice.
- Ta-da!

1660
01:56:02,870 --> 01:56:05,010
- That's disgusting.
- Fatality.

1661
01:56:06,640 --> 01:56:07,980
I got the voice.

1662
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:12,450
What's that?

1663
01:56:18,260 --> 01:56:20,590
I can have anything
I've ever wanted?

1664
01:56:24,260 --> 01:56:25,760
Billy.

1665
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:27,530
No, no, no!

1666
01:56:27,530 --> 01:56:28,860
- Stop it!
- Don't look at that!

1667
01:56:28,860 --> 01:56:30,330
Billy, don't do it!

1668
01:56:30,330 --> 01:56:32,330
Ah!

1669
01:56:32,340 --> 01:56:34,570
- You should hear yourselves!
- Not funny.

1670
01:56:34,570 --> 01:56:36,870
You think I'm gonna put
a demon ball in my head?

1671
01:56:36,870 --> 01:56:38,510
That's disgusting.

1672
01:56:38,510 --> 01:56:40,240
That's funny. That's pretty funny.
You got me going.

1673
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:41,910
- You got me going.
- Uh... Guys.

1674
01:56:45,050 --> 01:56:46,010
What?

1675
01:56:47,850 --> 01:56:49,750
Oh. Hey.

1676
01:56:49,750 --> 01:56:52,850
Oh, wow.

1677
01:56:59,930 --> 01:57:01,260
All right, we did it!

1678
01:57:01,260 --> 01:57:05,470
Hey, all right, yeah!
We did it!

1679
01:57:06,340 --> 01:57:08,940
We did it!

1680
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:11,940
Hey, you guys are all safe.
There's no more danger anymore.

1681
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:14,480
- We're fine. It's okay.
- All right, all right, all right.

1682
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:15,810
We're good.

1683
01:57:25,820 --> 01:57:27,760
You sure
this is gonna work?

1684
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:31,030
Told ya.

1685
01:57:31,030 --> 01:57:32,400
Whoa!

1686
01:57:34,030 --> 01:57:35,300
Whoa!

1687
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:51,310
You guys know
what this place is, right?

1688
01:57:51,310 --> 01:57:54,480
A dark, haunted cave
with demon statues.

1689
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:57,420
Well, yes, but also...

1690
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:03,160
Lair! We got a lair!

1691
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:04,420
- Lair.
- Yeah.

1692
01:58:04,430 --> 01:58:05,760
No, you right.

1693
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:07,440
We got a lair.

1694
01:58:09,100 --> 01:58:11,230
What's a lair?

1695
01:58:11,230 --> 01:58:12,900
<i>And thanks to six superheroes,</i>

1696
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:14,900
<i>citizens are back
in their homes,</i>

1697
01:58:14,900 --> 01:58:17,040
<i>safe again
with their families.</i>

1698
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:19,670
<i>And here with an eyewitness
account of the events...</i>

1699
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:22,140
<i>It was</i> <i>crazy, man!</i>

1700
01:58:22,150 --> 01:58:23,950
<i>Creatures from</i> <i>hell!</i>

1701
01:58:23,950 --> 01:58:26,680
<i>Lightning coming out of everyone's</i> <i>everything!</i>

1702
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:29,550
<i>And that is not</i> <i>cool, man!</i>

1703
01:58:29,550 --> 01:58:31,650
So, first day
as a superhero.

1704
01:58:31,650 --> 01:58:34,760
Automatic top spot
for best ever.

1705
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:36,760
The man shattered
the glass noodle ceiling.

1706
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:38,990
- No. That's racist.
- Not if I say it.

1707
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,730
Guys.

1708
01:58:40,730 --> 01:58:42,330
- All hands on deck.
- Oh!

1709
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:46,940
Wait, wait, wait.

1710
01:58:46,940 --> 01:58:48,040
Wait.

1711
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:49,570
Thank you for this food.

1712
01:58:49,570 --> 01:58:51,670
Thank you for this day.

1713
01:58:51,680 --> 01:58:53,780
Thank you for this family.

1714
01:58:53,780 --> 01:58:56,180
I thought maybe
this time I'd stay.

1715
01:58:57,380 --> 01:58:59,650
I mean, after all,

1716
01:59:00,250 --> 01:59:01,390
I'm home.

1717
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:35,050
He better not sit
at our table.

1718
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:39,820
Nope!

1719
01:59:42,030 --> 01:59:43,030
Okay.

1720
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:47,930
What are you doing?

1721
01:59:47,930 --> 01:59:50,230
Waiting for your imaginary BFF
to show up?

1722
01:59:50,230 --> 01:59:51,670
Yeah.

1723
02:00:00,110 --> 02:00:01,440
What are you guys doing here?

1724
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:02,910
Well, we're having lunch
with you.

1725
02:00:02,910 --> 02:00:04,850
But you guys have
different lunch periods.

1726
02:00:04,850 --> 02:00:08,280
Well, we made
a very special arrangement.

1727
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:11,890
- Darla, what's going on?
- Why are you asking me?

1728
02:00:11,890 --> 02:00:12,990
Freddy Freeman.

1729
02:00:15,260 --> 02:00:16,920
This guy

1730
02:00:16,930 --> 02:00:20,590
taught me everything I know
about being a dope superhero.

1731
02:00:20,600 --> 02:00:22,860
True story. You should get
some pointers from him.

1732
02:00:22,870 --> 02:00:27,330
What's going on,
my best bud in the whole world?

1733
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:32,070
And also new kids that I'm meeting
for the first time but seem very cool?

1734
02:00:32,070 --> 02:00:33,470
Uh...

1735
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:36,110
I invited another friend.
I hope that's okay.

1736
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:37,590
Sun of Ra.

1737
02:03:38,330 --> 02:03:44,870
Ouroboros.

1738
02:03:46,670 --> 02:03:50,370
Solomon's...

1739
02:03:50,370 --> 02:03:53,010
Knot.

1740
02:04:03,950 --> 02:04:07,590
No! No!

1741
02:04:13,660 --> 02:04:16,430
<i>Primitive symbols.</i>

1742
02:04:16,430 --> 02:04:22,000
<i>You walking, talking monkeys
with your cave drawings.</i>

1743
02:04:22,010 --> 02:04:26,340
<i>You assume there's only
one way to gain magic.</i>

1744
02:04:26,340 --> 02:04:29,180
<i>No, no, no.</i>

1745
02:04:29,180 --> 02:04:32,320
<i>There are more ways
than a mind can imagine.</i>

1746
02:04:33,380 --> 02:04:35,150
What in God's name?

1747
02:04:35,150 --> 02:04:39,590
<i>I name the gods, Doctor.
Not the other way around.</i>

1748
02:04:39,590 --> 02:04:43,020
<i>Oh, what fun
we're going to have together.</i>

1749
02:04:43,030 --> 02:04:47,430
<i>The Seven Realms
are about to be ours.</i>

1750
02:11:13,420 --> 02:11:16,050
Don't beat yourself up, buddy.
You're gonna find someone.

1751
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:18,390
Yeah, I'm sure.

1752
02:11:18,390 --> 02:11:20,920
Because there's plenty of fish
in the sea.

1753
02:11:22,390 --> 02:11:24,360
Of course it's not real.
I can't talk to fish.

1754
02:11:24,360 --> 02:11:26,890
Even if I could, I mean, honestly,
what could we do with that that's cool?

1755
02:11:26,890 --> 02:11:31,370
I don't know, maybe command
an army of billions in the ocean.

1756
02:11:31,370 --> 02:11:34,700
Oh, yeah.
Well, that's not that cool.

1757
02:11:36,700 --> 02:11:43,700
