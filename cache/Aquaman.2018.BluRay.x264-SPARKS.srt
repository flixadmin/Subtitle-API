301
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,431
by inviting Xebel
to be the first kingdom

302
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,552
to join King Orm's alliance.

303
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,592
As if you had a choice, Vulko.

304
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,552
By law,
you need four of the Seven Kingdoms

305
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,750
to ascend and attack.

306
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,634
The Lost Nation and the Deserters
have long perished.

307
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,513
The Trench are nothing but animals.

308
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,475
The Brine will never join you,
and the Fishermen are cowards.

309
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,431
Without me and my army to convince
them, your plans are stillborn.

310
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,916
But I know what you really want.

311
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,475
Once you've obtained
the pledge of the four kingdoms,

312
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,199
you will be ordained

313
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,714
Ocean Master.

314
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,555
That is merely a title.

315
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,158
I'm no fool, King Orm.

316
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,760
As Ocean Master,
you'll be commander

317
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,111
of the greatest military might
on this planet.

318
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,393
I am the natural choice to lead it.

319
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,710
Are you?

320
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,479
What about the rumors
that there's another?

321
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,279
An Atlantean,
living among the surface.

322
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,753
One of royal blood.

323
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,439
You may sit on the throne of Atlantis,
but your claim to it is weak.

324
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,599
How can you possibly hope
to unite the empire?

325
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,672
My mother's bastard
has never even been to Atlantis.

326
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,079
His loyalty is to the surface.

No, thank you. I'm not interested.

You defeated Steppenwolf
and saved Atlantis.

359
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,399
That had nothing to
do with Atlantis.

360

Your half-brother King Orm is about
to declare war upon the surface world.

The only way to stop this war

and that's why I'm here.

Vulko has learned of the location
of the Lost Trident of Atlan.

It's not a myth.

With the Sacred Trident,
the people will listen to you.

You can then claim your birthright

My birthright?
It died with my mother.

But I promise you this.
If Orm attacks,

I will treat him exactly the

When you're ready, I'll take you

I can't believe Orm attacked.

497
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,480
It wasn't an attack.

498
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,916
Legally, he's not allowed to yet.

499
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,238
What he did to your surface
warships was merely a warning.

500
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,396
What provoked it?

501
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,559
King Orm and your father
were ambushed by the surface.

502
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,995
By the surface? I don't think so.

503
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,873
They still think
Atlantis is a fairy tale.

504
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,520
I was there.

505
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,552
A surface warship fired at us.

506
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,474
Now, Xebel sides with Atlantis,

507
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,317
giving Orm a fleet big enough to force
the other two kingdoms to join him.

508
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,594
If we're going to prevent this war,
you must dethrone him now.

509
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,674
How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't wanna be king.

510
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,434
You don't understand.

511
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,679
Once he is named Ocean Master,
it'll be too late.

512
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,718
The power at his disposal will be
unlike anything you have ever seen.

513
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,750
I'm from the surface.
No one is gonna take me seriously.

514
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,239
Okay? I don't even
know where to begin.

515
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,835
By winning
the hearts and minds of the people

516
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,398
by proving to them that you're
worthy, and retrieving this.

517
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,350
Hmm.

518
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,794
I already got one of those.

519
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,276
Not like this one, you don't.

520
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,357
This is the Lost Trident of Atlan.

521
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,116
Oh, I know the story.

522
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,954
It's more than a story. It's real.

523
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,630
<i>It was forged by the greatest
weapon masters in history.</i>

524
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,436
<i>Crafted from Poseidon's steel
for King Atlan,</i>

525
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,397
<i>the first ruler of Atlantis.</i>

526
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,709
<i>Legend says the trident was imbued
with the power to command the sea.</i>

527
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,200
So what happened to it?

528
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,110
To know that is to go back to
the time before the Great Fall,

<i>when King Atlan ruled

<i>when the kingdoms of
Atlantis were one.</i>

<i>It was a time of great prosperity

<i>at a time when the rest of the world

00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:45,272
<i>But we became too ambitious,</i>

<i>too hungry for power.</i>

of the Sacred Trident.

We don't know.

Don't you see?

602
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,991
If I defeat the
firstborn son of Atlanna

603
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,629
in a formal challenge
in front of everyone,

604
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:49,710
then all Seven Kingdoms will have to
concede that I am the one true king.

605
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,157
Your Majesty, there is no victory
in defeating the ignorant.

606
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,120
Your brother is
clearly an imbecile.

607
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,077
Your Highness,
he doesn't know our ways.

608
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,232
Then he's about to
get an education.

609
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,678
Are you officially challenging me?

610
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,638
Hell yes, I challenge you.
And when I win...

611
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,559
If you win,

612
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:12,151
I will cease all immediate action.
The war is over.

613
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,480
But if I win...

614
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,400
You're over.

made, and I accept.

Your mother loved you
more than anything in the world.

648
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:45,230
But she had to return to Atlantis
to keep you safe.

649
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,472
Her marriage to King Orvax
was arranged a long time ago,

650
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,319
so she had to marry him...

651

And bear him a son, Prince Orm.

When Orvax
eventually found out about you,

653
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,800
he became overwhelmed with jealousy

654
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:03,278
and sacrificed her
to the creatures of the Trench.

Let's go, Lady Mera.

679

Down here, we have a legend
about the Karathen,

680
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:55,676
an ancient sea monster so powerful
that even King Atlan himself feared it.

681
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:59,760
So, he imprisoned it
in the depths of the ocean.

682
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:04,360
And in that abyss, the creature
bides its time waiting to rise again.

683
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,559

And now, the beast has awakened.

1168
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:49,909
That you have spent years training
him to take the throne from me.

1169
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:54,513
Do not deny it.

1170
01:38:57,680 --> 01:38:58,830
I do not.

1171
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:00,680

1173
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:07,470
I have devoted my life to Atlantis.

1174
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:11,559
He wanted nothing to do with it.
You swore to serve the throne!

1175
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:12,560
I do serve it.

1176
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:15,280
Arthur may only be half-Atlantean,

1177
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:19,314
but he's already twice the king
you'll ever be.
