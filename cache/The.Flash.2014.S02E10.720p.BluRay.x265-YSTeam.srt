1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:06,174
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,018
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:13,180
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:16,100
I fight crime and find other meta-humans
like me.

5
00:00:16,265 --> 00:00:18,768
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,984
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:25,109
And I am the only one fast enough
to stop them.

8
00:00:25,274 --> 00:00:27,824
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,696
Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:32,332
When my mother left us, she was pregnant.

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,243
Dad, I'm so sorry
that I didn't tell you sooner.

12
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:38,380
Hi. I'm Wally. I'm Francine's son.

13
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,337
You want Barry to get faster.

14
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:44,969
The more power he has,
the more I can take.

15
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,253
Don't let him take me back.

16
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,637
I won't.

17
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:49,765
And you're going to help me

18
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:52,973
in return for your daughter's life.

19
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:56,060
I will help you steal The Flash's speed.

20
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,979
I know I'm moving pretty fast, but
stop me if you've heard this one before.

21
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,317
Boy meets girl. Happens every day.

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,156
Except this boy was struck by lightning
and became the fastest man alive.

23
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:10,787
So, nothing is ever that simple.

24
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,704
Oh, my... Oh, uh... Careful.

25
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,954
Ho! Sorry. It's all good. It's all good.

26
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,123
Those... Those weren't
for me anyway, right?

27
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,668
They were. I didn't realize
roses were so flammable.

28
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,051
Oh, my God.

29
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,838
Well, it's the... It's the thought
that counts.

30
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:32,805
And, you know, proper fire safety
management, that counts most.

31
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:38,441
Yes. I have spent most of my life
feeling very unlucky.

32
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,850
Yeah, and now?

33
00:01:40,516 --> 00:01:42,735
Feels like I've been
struck by lightning twice.

34
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,030
No!

35
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,370
Help!

36
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,207
Help.

37
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:06,048
Flash, everything you have will be mine.

38
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,711
- No!
- No!

39
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:26,818
Okay, so, there's my desk.
Upstairs is Anti-Crime and the CSI lab.

40
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:30,700
That's where Barry works.
And we have the open files...

41
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:34,158
And that is a pencil. That, stapler.

42
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,042
Okay. Sorry, Wally. Obviously,
your sister got the funny genes.

43
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,997
Captain, I want you to meet somebody.

44
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,457
This is my son. Wally West.

45
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:43,997
Handsome young man, Joe.

46
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:45,586
Hey, he's a West. He can't help that.

47
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,751
Your pops here is a hell of a detective.

48
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,260
Obviously not.

49
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,348
Pleasure to meet you, Wally.

50
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:58,012
Anyway. I'm glad you're here, Wally.

51
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,556
Yeah, I've always wanted a baby brother.

52
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,439
What about the White Shadow?

53
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:06,479
You're joking but,
yeah, we did call Barry that.

54
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,693
He's been pretty busy. He's doing
a whole lot of running around.

55
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:12,699
But, why don't we do dinner?
The whole family?

56
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,360
I... I got plans.

57
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,780
Iris will cook.

58
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,118
Dad, wejust met the kid.
We don't want to kill him.

59
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,704
All right. We do take-out.
Chinese, whatever. Come on.

60
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:22,914
Where are your cuffs, Tail Lights?

61
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,379
Come on. Let's go.

62
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,756
You know that kid?

63
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:32,384
Uh, no, no. You know, it'sjust
what they say. I got one of those faces.

64
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,137
I'll see you guys at dinner.

65
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,550
Okay.

66
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,271
Any chance I could chat with you
for a minute?

67
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,728
Yeah. What's up, Detective?

68
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,602
Oh, I... I meant Iris.

69
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,570
Yeah. You're not needed.

70
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,985
I am needed. Somewhere.
I'm gonna go there.

71
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,241
What can I do for you?

72
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,079
Uh, I Just wanted to talk with you...

73
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:03,159
About Barry.

74
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,126
I know that Barry's, you know,
practically your brother

75
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,670
so I understand that your loyalty
is obviously to him, not me,

76
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,807
but I was just hoping that maybe
you would think I'm good for him,

77
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:19,093
so you'd want to help me figure him out.

78
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:23,016
Well, I mean, if you did that,
you would be the first.

79
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,353
Wonderful. That gives me tons of hope.

80
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,274
It's just... Um...

81
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:32,822
He's being... Not "distant" but...

82
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,028
"Guarded."

83
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,067
Yeah. He's being guarded.

84
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:39,829
And he's waking up from these bad dreams
and not telling me about them.

85
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:42,911
And I know that we got close really quick.

86
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,829
It's just... It's like
there's something holding him back.

87
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,372
Here's the thing about Barry.

88
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:55,132
He has a bad habit of carrying
the weight of the world on his shoulders.

89
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,596
Burdens that aren't even his to bear.

90
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,428
But he doesn't have to do that with me.

91
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,810
Which is exactly what you should tell him.

92
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,245
Hey! No. Absolutely not.

93
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,115
You don't get to throw somebody else's
stuff when you're pissed off.

94
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,086
Thank you.

95
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,384
What is this?

96
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,420
Wrong answers.

97
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,507
Maybe you're asking the wrong questions.

98
00:05:41,423 --> 00:05:42,516
What does that mean?

99
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,519
I've been thinking about this a lot
recently.

100
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,351
We keep trying to come up with ways
to make Barry faster,

101
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,608
but I still think we can figure out a way
to make Zoom slower.

102
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:53,394
We tried that already, remember?
Those darts didn't slow him down at all.

103
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,939
Yeah, I know. I'm not
talking about the darts, okay?

104
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,358
The darts clearly didn't work.
Theyjust pissed him off.

105
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:01,199
I'm talking about something else.
A way we can steal Zoom's speed.

106
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,826
How?

107
00:06:08,617 --> 00:06:09,744
The Turtle.

108
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,372
As some of you may well know,

109
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:16,509
I've been deeply embroiled in a secret,
one-sided battle with an invisible enemy.

110
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,466
No. Not the Turtle again.

111
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:20,880
What? What is the...
Who is the Turtle?

112
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,423
It's Cisco's white whale.

113
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:23,682
Half whale, half turtle.

114
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,932
Mmm, no. Do you see what you're doing,
Caitlin? Everybody's confused now.

115
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,187
Get to it.

116
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,519
I stumbled upon a few of these cases when
we were looking for the Reverse-Flash.

117
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:34,310
Robberies that were seemingly
committed at high-speed.

118
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:36,149
People holding their beloved items
one second,

119
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,610
those items were gone the next.

120
00:06:37,771 --> 00:06:39,115
Tell me what you see.

121
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,872
So he can, what? Stop time?

122
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,127
No, no, no. Look at the time code.
It's still running.

123
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:55,040
Yeah, okay. So if he's not stopping time,
what is he doing?

124
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,675
He's slowing down everything around him.

125
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,800
And that is why we call him The Turtle.

126
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,805
Why have you never
mentioned this guy to me before?

127
00:07:03,964 --> 00:07:06,514
Oh, I don't know. I think we'vejust been
a little distracted, you know?

128
00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:08,848
What with Captain Cold, and the
Weather Wizard, and Gorilla Grodd.

129
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,103
Do I need to go on?

130
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:12,937
Okay, so, if we can catch him,
figure out how he uses his powers...

131
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:15,898
Maybe we can show Zoom
what life is like in the slow lane.

132
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,687
How would you even know where to find him?

133
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:20,572
Well, the robberies in the videos
all correspond with police reports

134
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,735
that were dismissed as
"lost or missing items" instead of thefts.

135
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:24,903
The suspect's MO being?

136
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,742
Items of immense personal value.

137
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,125
Huh...

138
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:39,047
Oh! It appears that there's
a press conference at CCPD

139
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,007
because the Vandervoort diamonds
have just been recovered.

140
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:46,137
From hell's heart, I stab at thee.

141
00:07:47,716 --> 00:07:50,687
The perpetrators who committed this
heartless crime have been apprehended,

142
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,141
and are now in our custody.

143
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,601
And we're happy to report

144
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,564
that the famed Vandervoort diamonds have
been returned to their rightful owner.

145
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:59,855
The real gem is the return
of my great grandfather's ring.

146
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:03,408
Getting that returned to the family
is what's most priceless to me.

147
00:08:03,565 --> 00:08:04,737
Gotcha.

148
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:32,888
The ring is gone. What happened to it?

149
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,562
Lock this place down. No one
leaves this room. Sweep the Precinct.

150
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,565
Well, the good news is,

151
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,280
whatever the Turtle did,
it only affected you temporarily.

152
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,783
Yo! What was it like?
Being in Turtle Time?

153
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,165
Yeah. No, it was weird.
It was like waves of inertness.

154
00:08:53,323 --> 00:08:56,543
Like all the energy was suddenly sucked
out of my body, and then it would return.

155
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,580
That's because
that's exactly what was happening.

156
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,671
He has the ability to transfer all the
surrounding kinetic energy into himself.

157
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,427
Leaving everyone else
in a temporary state of potential energy.

158
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:05,677
That's right.

159
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,596
So why could I still move?

160
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,969
Your speed. Your speed allows you to
change positions faster than anyone else.

161
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,979
So you can convert your stored
potential energy back to kinetic energy.

162
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,389
Excuse me. Where are you going?

163
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,432
Trying to figure out how to use this
against Zoom.

164
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,190
You remember Zoom?

165
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:24,113
"Cisco, please join me."

166
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,741
"We'll use your idea, and take it to new
scientific heights and save the world."

167
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,197
"Yes, I'd love to."

168
00:09:29,693 --> 00:09:33,698
Okay! Facial recognition software
found us a match

169
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:39,121
from the press conference footage.
The Turtle's name is Russell Glosson.

170
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,663
He was a small-time thief,

171
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,504
who stopped thieving
after the particle accelerator explosion.

172
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:46,009
All right, I'm gonna head to work.
Catch Joe up.

173
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,171
Let me know if you find out
anything else.

174
00:09:51,548 --> 00:09:52,926
You okay?

175
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,730
Yeah, yeah. It's just...

176
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:01,688
It's hard to look at that and not think
about how I can't help people anymore.

177
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,105
Well, we have lots of technology here.

178
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,278
Why don't we figure out
how to get your speed back?

179
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:10,826
I'm a scientist too, Caitlin.

180
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:14,534
And when I first got here, all I did was
work on how to get my speed back.

181
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,042
Believe me, whatever test you could run...

182
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:20,753
I've already done it.

183
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,961
The Turtle?

184
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,381
Cisco's been looking for this guy forever.

185
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,174
Singh just put an APB out on him.

186
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,094
Um... How did everybody know
about Glosson before I did?

187
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,313
Mmm. Cisco's got a whole list of
unidentified metas.

188
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:42,559
The boys around here are calling him
Cisco de La Mancha.

189
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,688
Hey, are you good?
You seem a little jittery.

190
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:48,903
A little anxious.

191
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:50,948
Let's be honest.

192
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,700
I'm really nervous about
this whole dinner tonight with Wally.

193
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,331
Come on. Why are you...
Why are you nervous?

194
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,866
You're, like, the best dad ever.
He'll see that.

195
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,288
It'll be a whole lot easier
with you being there.

196
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,121
Joe, I wouldn't miss it.

197
00:11:05,914 --> 00:11:07,383
- See you tonight.
- All right.

198
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,505
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

199
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,048
- You got a sec?
- Yeah.

200
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,341
I just...

201
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,302
I Just want to make sure
everything's okay.

202
00:11:18,635 --> 00:11:19,761
Yeah.

203
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:22,773
Yeah, I'm... I, uh, don't want to nag.

204
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,649
That's not, you know, who I am. I Just...

205
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,938
I don't want you to feel burdened
by anything.

206
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,697
No, I don't.

207
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,575
Okay.

208
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:38,787
Yeah, wait, Patty. The New Years
is always a hard time for me.

209
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,788
It's when my mom died,

210
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,998
so just those memories all come out
and they're hard to put away.

211
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,546
So if it feels like
I haven't been communicating...

212
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,125
I'm sorry-I'm sorry. I didn't know.

213
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,756
No, no, no.

214
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:53,467
Look, um, we haven't had a romantic night
in a while.

215
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,091
What do you say, tomorrow night,
we get some dinner and drinks,

216
00:11:57,966 --> 00:12:00,061
and maybe a little kissing...

217
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,517
That sounds like what we need.

218
00:12:01,678 --> 00:12:03,807
Okay. All right, I'll see you later.

219
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:05,144
Okay.

220
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,366
Okay, I think we can call it.
Wally is not coming.

221
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,325
I'm sorry, Joe.
I know how much this meant to you.

222
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,409
He's a kid, right? I get it.

223
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,952
He could have at least called.

224
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,587
Well, there could be a number of reasons
why he didn't.

225
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,960
Thank you for being here. I love you.

226
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,677
I love you.

227
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,844
See you in the morning, Barr.

228
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:39,224
Yeah.

229
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,269
Well, West family 2.0
is not really off to a great start.

230
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:51,357
You've been quiet all evening.

231
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,364
The Turtle?

232
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,192
How do you know about him?

233
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,910
No, erm. No. Just had a lot on my mind.

234
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:08,087
Patty? We... We may have met for coffee.

235
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,297
Iris...

236
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,048
She really cares about you, Barry.

237
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:15,131
And she's just wondering
why you've been so "guarded."

238
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,716
And what did you tell her?

239
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,006
I told her to talk to you.

240
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,549
Oh, that's not cool.

241
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:26,722
You know, she did mention
that you've been having nightmares.

242
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:32,442
About Zoom killing her.

243
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:40,741
Look, I know that things have been
moving pretty fast between you two.

244
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,033
But you realize you can't keep things
from her forever, right?

245
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,831
One day, you're going to have to
tell her the truth.

246
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:52,256
That I'm The Flash? I can't do that.

247
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,048
Barry... I wish a year ago,
you had told me the truth.

248
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,928
So, what?
You think that I should just tell her?

249
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:03,634
I think that if you are serious
about being with her,

250
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,679
you have to.

251
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,269
All right. Then that's what I'm gonna do.

252
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,481
I'll tell Patty I'm The Flash.

253
00:14:26,948 --> 00:14:29,952
Hey. You guys got anything?

254
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,288
I think we found the next target for

255
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,173
our 30-something
metahuman-not-a-ninja Turtle.

256
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,879
How long did it take you
to come up with that one?

257
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,720
Itjust came out of my mouth.
Did you see that? That was amazing.

258
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,427
Central City Museum is hosting
a special black-tie event tonight

259
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,432
showcasing The Crystal Ball.

260
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,144
It's a famous painting, apparently,

261
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:48,725
recently recovered from Markovia.

262
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,982
The painting is on loan to the museum
from the Silverberg family.

263
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:56,024
Jacob Silverberg, himself, said, "The
painting's safe return means more to us"

264
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,188
"than all the money in the world."

265
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,323
It's like they're begging Turtle
to rob it.

266
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,155
Okay, yes. This is a plan.

267
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:08,325
So, the Turtle will make his move, and
we can be there waiting to take him down.

268
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,494
How do you look in a tux?

269
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:14,460
Come on. He's 6'2", he's square-jawed
and he's jacked. I think he looks fine.

270
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,664
I'm 6'4".

271
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,083
Oh, crap.

272
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,341
Problem?

273
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,761
No. No.

274
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:25,642
An opportunity. Maybe. Hold on.

275
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,184
Hey, you. I'm excited to see you tonight.

276
00:15:31,346 --> 00:15:33,394
Yeah, me too. Actually, about that, um...

277
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:38,313
So I know I said let's have dinner, but,
uh, you've been wanting me to share more.

278
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:42,654
So, I thought that I would share
that I love art.

279
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,195
Okay. Interesting.

280
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,783
Yeah. No, it's just, you know,
I can't get enough of art.

281
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,496
Anyway, there's this event
at the Central City Museum tonight.

282
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:54,582
They're showing this really famous
painting that I've always loved.

283
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:58,375
Actually, I don't know anything about art.

284
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:04,048
But, what's the saying? I know what
I like, and I like you, so count me in.

285
00:16:04,212 --> 00:16:06,181
All right, great. I'll see you at 8:00.

286
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:07,383
7:00.

287
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,717
Or 7:00. I'll see you at 7:00.

288
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,477
Okay. 7:00 it is.

289
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:11,727
Bye.

290
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,770
You know, you're a really great superhero,
a really great superhero...

291
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:17,024
Thanks. Thank you.

292
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,563
But, do you think it's a good idea, when
you're fighting crime, to bring a date?

293
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,279
I'm gonna tell Patty that I'm The Flash.

294
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,071
What... ls that a bad idea?
What do we think?

295
00:16:28,236 --> 00:16:31,912
I will say, she put bullets
in King Shark and Harry.

296
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,952
So, as far as I'm concerned,
that's Team Flash material to me.

297
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,422
All right. Yes. Thank you, Cisco.
Yeah. Thank you.

298
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,706
- Cool.
- Mmm...

299
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,171
I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna tell her.

300
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,634
Don't tell her.

301
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,049
Huh?

302
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,390
You care for this woman?

303
00:16:55,096 --> 00:16:58,692
That's nice. Then keep her
as far away from this as possible.

304
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,562
And here's why.

305
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:07,361
If Zoom finds out who you care for,
who you love, who you live for,

306
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,163
he'll take them from you.

307
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,392
All right. Keep your eyes open
for the Turtle.

308
00:17:36,012 --> 00:17:37,810
A sentence I never thought I would say.

309
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,785
Cisco, are you and Harry in position?

310
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:57,167
I'm in the security feed. I've got
the facial recognition software running,

311
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,453
so we'll be able to spot Turtle
before he makes his move.

312
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:00,872
Turtle.

313
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:04,459
Why do you insist
on giving them ridiculous nicknames?

314
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:08,299
Me? Who's the genius
that came up with "Zoom?"

315
00:18:12,215 --> 00:18:13,558
Yeah, well...

316
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:17,680
I'll tell you.

317
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:22,443
About two years ago,
this was on Earth-2 now,

318
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:30,781
the CCPD there, they got a 911 call
about a hostage situation.

319
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:35,373
But when the S.W.A.T. team got there,
there were no hostages.

320
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:37,871
It was a trap.

321
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:43,544
Zoom set a trap in order to show
the police that they could not stop him.

322
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:49,550
And he killed 14 officers. Men and women.

323
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,259
Slaughtered them.
Left one alive to tell what happened.

324
00:18:55,968 --> 00:19:02,726
That officer described blue lightning
zooming all about

325
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:05,355
as his comrades,

326
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,815
brothers- and sisters-in-arms,
were murdered.

327
00:19:10,523 --> 00:19:15,075
That officer considered himself
to be a lucky one,

328
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,787
spared in order to tell the tale,

329
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,416
until Zoom went to his house that night
and killed him, too.

330
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,251
Anyway, that's how
we got the nickname Zoom.

331
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:37,971
If you ever need me to vibe,

332
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,769
so you can know if she's still alive...

333
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,057
She's alive.

334
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,189
Right.

335
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,657
No!

336
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,163
You have a really weird look on your face.
Do I look weird?

337
00:20:03,326 --> 00:20:08,208
No, no. Um, you look like a dream.

338
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,759
You look very handsome.

339
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:14,963
I can't wait to see this painting.

340
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:19,636
What painting? The painting. Uh, yeah.
Me too. Um, yeah.

341
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,813
How about we talk first?

342
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,523
I thought you'd never ask.

343
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,193
I can't figure you out, Barry Allen.

344
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:37,157
That is because I work hard
to hide who I really am.

345
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,366
You don't have to hide with me.

346
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:44,664
I just have to really trust someone,

347
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,378
if they're gonna know the truth.

348
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,798
D0 you?

349
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,674
I trust you, Patty.

350
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,972
I trust you, too.

351
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,138
Patty, um...

352
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:06,519
After I was struck by lightning,

353
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,858
when I woke up...

354
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,737
We've got eyes on Turtle!

355
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,029
Barry, you were saying?

356
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,365
I have to go. I'm sorry.

357
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:25,284
What? What? Barry!

358
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,130
CCPD! Freeze!

359
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,848
How are you as fast as The Flash?

360
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,810
Oh, no. He is much slower.

361
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:53,528
What's this, a trap? I'm slow, not stupid.

362
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,929
Oh, my God!

363
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,183
Okay, I got him. Come on.

364
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:52,587
Your pupils are normal.
Your heart rate's a little low.

365
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,544
But other than that,
no concussive symptoms.

366
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,755
I really do feel fine. What about Turtle?

367
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:58,134
No sign of him.

368
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,465
Or the painting.

369
00:22:59,627 --> 00:23:02,221
He must have gotten away with it
in the chaos.

370
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,848
Yeah. Things went a little sideways

371
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:07,011
After your girlfriend decided to go all
Lethal Weapon lthrough IV on Turtle.

372
00:23:07,176 --> 00:23:11,147
Oh, my God. Patty's gonna think
I ditched her. No. I gotta go.

373
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:15,152
Where are you... Finding Turtle
is what's important right now.

374
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,654
Yeah. This is important to me, too.

375
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,815
But we need to see
if your speed still works.

376
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,154
I think it still works.

377
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,319
We still have to find out
how Turtle drained him of it.

378
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,742
Can I talk to you for a second?

379
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,633
You never got your champagne.

380
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:46,142
I couldn't find any flutes.
I hope that's okay.

381
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:47,513
Of course.

382
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,427
Here you go.

383
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,644
Mmm...

384
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:04,280
Let me go see if I can
make myself useful.

385
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,575
Mmm!

386
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,826
I was right. I thought
that you would look mad and you do.

387
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,076
What happened?

388
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,950
Um...

389
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:57,288
I don't really have a good excuse.

390
00:24:57,453 --> 00:24:59,923
Nothing? Nothing? I mean, come on, Barry.

391
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,923
Anything is better than nothing.

392
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:04,384
I mean, come on.

393
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:07,138
Holy crap, I've been a really, really
cool girlfriend.

394
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:10,346
Most girls don't have the self-esteem
to handle the...

395
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,557
"Plans? Oh, no plans. That's cool."

396
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:17,476
Orthe waking up in the middle
of the night screaming again?

397
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:21,770
Fine. Whatever. And then,
and then the really, really fancy plans?

398
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:26,320
Which were awesome, and then
you ditched me right before I almost died.

399
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,411
I mean, when you put it that way, it's...

400
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,946
I'm actually really upset.

401
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:33,789
Yeah, I know.

402
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,996
Look, we've been having fun.
And fun has been so great.

403
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:42,465
But I'm moving past fun to the close part.

404
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:46,465
That's what I want, okay?
That's where I'm going.

405
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,969
You need to figure out
what it is that you want.

406
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:50,970
And do it fast.

407
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,479
Fast is my specialty.

408
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:57,325
Tail Lights! Tail Lights!

409
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,537
Yeah!

410
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,215
Yo, pay up.

411
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,817
What, you got someone tailing me now?

412
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,656
Why didn't you show up for dinner
last night?

413
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,159
Couldn't make it.

414
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,912
You tell someone you're gonna
be somewhere, you show up.

415
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,700
Guess I didn't have my dad
to teach me that, huh?

416
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,920
Is this why you came to Central City?

417
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,709
Not to get to know me or your sister,
but this nonsense?

418
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,927
You know, no one in Keystone
will race me anymore.

419
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,013
But I don't actually have
to explain myself to you.

420
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,516
Actually, you do.

421
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,181
This is illegal. I'm a cop, remember?

422
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,688
Oh, yeah. Yes. The detective
who didn't know he had a son.

423
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,941
And who doesn't know anything about me.

424
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:07,611
I am trying to get to know you, Wally.

425
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,154
These races, that car that I won,

426
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,818
that's the only way that
I can pay for my mom's hospital bills.

427
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,487
Get her the help that she needs.

428
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,871
You don't have to do this. I have money
saved. I can dip into my pension.

429
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:24,833
I don't need your money. I can take care
of myself and my mom, okay?

430
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:29,125
I'm the man of our house.
That position has been filled.

431
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,674
Go home to your family, Joe.

432
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:48,853
Barry?

433
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,605
Hey.

434
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,003
What do you want from me?

435
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,384
The thing most precious to The Flash.

436
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,592
You.

437
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:30,690
Patty?

438
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:45,246
No, no, no, no, no.

439
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:55,093
Joe, Joe!
Um, I think the Turtle has Patty.

440
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,300
Look, just meet me at S.T.A.R. Labs,
all right?

441
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,080
What do you want from me?

442
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,327
I want you to stop moving...

443
00:30:28,242 --> 00:30:29,414
Forever.

444
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,416
What do you get out of killing me?

445
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,832
Oh, I'm not gonna kill you.

446
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:36,298
That's much too fast and messy.

447
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,006
I like to take things nice and slow.

448
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,220
You don't have to hurt me
to try to prove a point.

449
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,259
This isn't about hurting you.

450
00:30:45,259 --> 00:30:48,388
This is about hurting someone
who values you.

451
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,106
Who, Barry?

452
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:54,436
No. The Flash.

453
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,445
What does he have to do with this?

454
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,406
I saw the way he saved you.

455
00:31:02,568 --> 00:31:05,413
Yes, that's what he does. He's a hero.

456
00:31:05,571 --> 00:31:07,574
He saves people who need saving.

457
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,461
It's a waste of time saving people.

458
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,295
They take everything for granted.

459
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,095
So you take the things
that matter most to them.

460
00:31:20,836 --> 00:31:23,009
My wife, Rosalyn, took me for granted.

461
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:28,269
She wanted to leave me,
the thing I valued most.

462
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:32,557
So that's what this is about?
You're hurt because your wife left you.

463
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,311
I couldn't let that happen.

464
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,816
So I made her mine.

465
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,240
Forever.

466
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,060
I do hope I spelled your name right.

467
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:18,606
Barr, we'll find her.

468
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:20,363
I'm not getting any leads on this guy.

469
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,023
It's like he's totally
fallen off the grid.

470
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,193
You know, any of the stuff
he's stolen, I can't find it.

471
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:29,285
He keeps them. He keeps them
the way a serial killer collects trophies.

472
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,825
He's stolen a lot of stuff.

473
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,210
Which means he needs a lot of space
to store it, right?

474
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:36,962
That's where we start.
See if he rented any storage spaces.

475
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:40,296
No, no... I'm not getting anything.

476
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:45,343
Wait a minute. His ex-wife used to be
an archivist

477
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,474
for antiquities at the Naydel Library
before it shut down.

478
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,511
And it shut down three months
after the accelerator exploded.

479
00:32:51,677 --> 00:32:53,555
That place is big enough to hold
Turtle's stuff?

480
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,102
Okay, all right.

481
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:58,108
Wait, Barry, we haven't even figured out
how to neutralize the Turtle's power.

482
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,111
Well, I'm gonna have to power through it.

483
00:33:04,773 --> 00:33:06,526
All right.
I'm outside the library.

484
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,028
Barry, the only way to save Patty

485
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,951
is if you grab her
in between each of the Turtle's pulses.

486
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,788
You'll only have two-tenths of a second
to make your moves.

487
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,076
I got it.

488
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,917
No!

489
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,715
I guess he doesn't care about you
as much as I thought.

490
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,347
No!

491
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,726
No! No! Please...

492
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:58,764
Patty. It's all right.

493
00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:04,398
Thank you. Thank you.

494
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,438
Thank you, whoever you are.

495
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:11,074
It's okay. It's okay.

496
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,373
Hey, Turtle.

497
00:35:26,373 --> 00:35:28,842
So you want to know
my new definition of "irony"?

498
00:35:30,085 --> 00:35:33,385
Now you are our most prized possession.

499
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:41,681
Patty okay?

500
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,016
She is. Yeah.

501
00:35:55,277 --> 00:35:56,403
Jay.

502
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,119
Yeah?

503
00:36:00,532 --> 00:36:04,708
I know. Why didn't you tell me
that you're sick?

504
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,630
The champagne...

505
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,260
You took my DNA off the glass.

506
00:36:11,585 --> 00:36:15,762
You know I lost my husband.
How hard that was for me to move on.

507
00:36:16,715 --> 00:36:20,436
How could you let me get close to you
knowing that soon, I'd lose you, too?

508
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:27,394
I Just... I didn't expect this.

509
00:36:28,894 --> 00:36:29,942
I didn't expect you.

510
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,606
Then help me find a cure.

511
00:36:33,315 --> 00:36:34,532
There is no cure.

512
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,992
The only way to save me
is to get my speed back.

513
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,083
And the only way to do that
is to stop Zoom.

514
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,244
Then let's stop him.

515
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,248
Yeah.

516
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:58,846
Hey.

517
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,478
I think I left my sweater here
the other night. It's green.

518
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,056
Oh, yeah.

519
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,481
I thought that didn't look like Barry's.

520
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,153
I'm heading back to Keystone tonight.

521
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,235
That's a fast trip.

522
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:20,117
Yeah, well, it's getting a little hot
in Central City for me.

523
00:37:20,362 --> 00:37:23,081
Don't worry, I'll try not to run
too many lights on the way there.

524
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:32,793
You know, if you're waiting
for an apology, it's not coming.

525
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,753
No, no. I'm...

526
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,677
I'm the one that should be apologizing
to you.

527
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:44,516
I felt bad not being there
while you were growing up,

528
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,269
And I was pushing
this whole father-son thing.

529
00:37:49,224 --> 00:37:50,476
I'm sorry.

530
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,153
Let's just slow down a bit.

531
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,360
I won't try to be your instant dad

532
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:59,027
and you won't have to pretend
that you want to be my son.

533
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,030
Deal?

534
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,166
All that food for you?

535
00:38:07,367 --> 00:38:10,166
Doesn't have to be. You like chow mein?

536
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,043
No.

537
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,844
But I like kung pao chicken.

538
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,896
Initial and sign.

539
00:38:30,557 --> 00:38:33,402
There you go. Thank you, guys.
Crazy night.

540
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,731
- Patty. Hey.
- Hi.

541
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,773
Um, can we talk? Like, really talk?

542
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,067
Yeah, uh...

543
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,202
No. Now is not really an awesome time.

544
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,409
I have a mountain of paperwork on my desk
I need to finish, so I'm sorry, I can't...

545
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,119
Okay, no, no. Okay. Really quick.

546
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,835
Urn, so you were right.
You were right about everything.

547
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:54,795
Urn, I've been closed off and weird
and all the things that you said I was.

548
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:58,713
But mostly, I have not been honest.

549
00:38:58,878 --> 00:38:59,925
Barry?

550
00:39:01,713 --> 00:39:03,260
I'm leaving Central City.

551
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,144
What?

552
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:13,610
Before Mardon, and before my dad,
before everything

553
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,521
I always wanted to be CSI.

554
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,275
And four years ago, I was accepted into
the Forensic Science program

555
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,784
at Midway City University.

556
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,788
That's a really great school.

557
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,708
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I Just... I didn't go.

558
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:34,005
You know, I deferred to become a cop
and catch my dad's killer.

559
00:39:35,914 --> 00:39:37,166
And I've done that.

560
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,672
So, uh...

561
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,471
So it's time to move on.

562
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:45,382
From thejob.

563
00:39:48,802 --> 00:39:49,974
From everything.

564
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,231
Patty, Patty, Pat...

565
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,829
Journal log entry number 113.

566
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:17,132
Jess, I'm coming for you.

567
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:20,009
Soon. I promise.

568
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:24,306
I was thinking earlier today
about the time that you were four,

569
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,722
I took you to the planetarium,
just you and me.

570
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:31,514
I remember because it was the first time
I took you out all by myself.

571
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,309
The planetarium was crowded,
you held my hand for dear life.

572
00:40:36,224 --> 00:40:38,353
Or maybe it was the other way around.

573
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,360
But it was in the Mars exhibit
that I lost you.

574
00:40:41,521 --> 00:40:44,025
Panic. I had that place locked down.

575
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,536
And in one minute, I had
every security guard looking for you,

576
00:40:46,693 --> 00:40:49,367
and I could feel the fear rise
in the back of my throat,

577
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,873
and something else rising also.

578
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:57,255
Some dark instinct inside me

579
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:01,713
about what I would do
to the person who had taken you.

580
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:03,757
The things I would do...

581
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,547
Unspeakable things.

582
00:41:08,173 --> 00:41:13,226
And it was in that moment that I realized
for certain

583
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:19,561
that I would do anything to get you back.

584
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,010
Gideon.

585
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,603
Yes, Professor Thawne?

586
00:41:53,927 --> 00:41:55,224
Where the hell am I?
