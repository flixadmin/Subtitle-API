1
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,180
Your chances of survival
are astronomically low, James.

2
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,060
Continuing to run is ill-advised.

00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,960
Hope you're well rested, Edward.

5
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,790
We have a lot of work ahead of us.

6
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,170
Edward?

7
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,240
Edward, what is it?

8
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,640
Is someone down there, boy?

00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,770

13
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,120
Ooh, pretty, pretty.

14
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,180
I'll call you Charlotte.

15
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,680
Ooh, you're a handsome devil.
What's your name?

16
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,220
Oswald Cobblepot.

17
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,110
But I'm guessing you already knew that.

18
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,290
Stop!

19
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,170
Penguin. Didn't think
you'd miss a couple things.

20
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,870
Couple things go missing all the time.

21
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,910
How did you know about this place?

22
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,350
All of the thieves I used are dead.

23
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,230
Yep, yep.

24
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,690
Was on a job.

25
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,500
Someone got there first.

26
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,090
Followed them back here.

27
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,110
Saw you. Bang, bang.

28
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,780
Then you know what is in store.

29
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,610
I do hope whatever you came
here for was worth your life.

30
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,440
The Russifer Diamond.

31
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,170
Not Russifer. Charlotte.

32
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,510
What's in your other hand?

33
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,510
Wait, how did you...

34
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,620
Bye-bye.

35
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,870
Who the hell was that?

36
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,280
Oh, God...

37
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,030
Oh!

38
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,820
Oh, God. It happened again, didn't it?

39
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,460
What did I do?

40
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,960
You tried to kill me.

41
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,880
Oh. Is that all?

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,630
I need answers, Ed.

43
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,320
I know Walker gave the orders
to destroy Haven

44
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,190
and the supply helicopter.

45
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,710
What is she planning next?

46
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,440
I don't know.

47
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:32,200
Jim, I don't remember anything
once I go under.

48
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,900
You're bleeding.

49
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,070
You have to let me go.
I'm not responsible for this.

50
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,320
That chip in your head
could be evidence.

51
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,390
So unless you want me to rip it out,

52
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,940
- you're coming with me.
- Okay.

53
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,010
Bruce.

54
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,210
There you are.

55
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,880
So, go on, then.

56
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,040
How'd it go with Selina?

57
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,400
Oh, dear.

58
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,940
Well, I am sorry, Master Bruce,
but perhaps it's for the best.

59
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,230
Maybe. That's not why I called
you here. You see this?

60
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,900
Yeah, I know, right?
Looks like Captain Gordon's

61
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,490
finally getting the help
this city so desperately needs.

62
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,190
Is he?

63
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,530
What the people desperately
need is food and medicine.

64
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,060
Not just more guns.

65
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,030
What is it?

66
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,010
No, it's just this unit.
Their motto is "Born of Blood."

67
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,740
You know them?

68
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,150
Yeah, by reputation only.

69
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,480
They're a horrible bunch of bastards.

70
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,950
They specialize in military
coups, assassinations.

71
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,180
They're certainly not the vanguard

72
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,560
for humanitarian relief.

73
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,490
Excuse me.

74
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,590
When's the supply
shipment gonna be here?

75
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,960
Supplies?

76
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,760
These people are desperate for food,

77
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,100
clean water, medicine.

78
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,620
Oh, yeah. It's on its way.

79
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,180
Where's Captain Gordon?

80
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,310
We lost sight of Gordon.

81
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,180
But don't worry. Eduardo's out
there looking for him right now.

82
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,180
Unless you know where we might find him?

83
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,280
Logically, he'd come here.

84
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,750
Unless there's some reason he can't.

85
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,250
Tell you what, kiddo.

86
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,389
I'm gonna find you and your
friend a quiet place in the back

87
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,400
where you can wait for Gordon.

88
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,440
Ah, don't you worry about it, mate.

89
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,930
We'll just catch up with him later.

90
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,570
I insist.

91
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,650
We need to find Jim.

92
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,270
So the government is behind
Haven and the supply helicopter,

93
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,190
and they did it with a chip
in this one's head?

94
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,620
Is that really the craziest thing
you've ever heard, Barbara?

95
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,100
Bruce hit me up on the radio

96
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,370
a little while ago, looking for you.

97
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,830
Said things are amiss in the GCPD.

98
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,130
I'll reach out, see if we
can meet up somewhere safe.

99
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,590
Can you pull in some of your
people, see if they can help?

100
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,970
No. I need them guarding my territory.

101
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,130
- But you have me.
- And me.

102
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't trust you.

103
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,640
With or without that chip in your head.

104
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,010
Jim.

105
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,220
They used me as a pawn
to murder innocent people.

106
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,600
They messed with my brain.

107
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,070
The thing that I want is revenge.

108
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,390
How do I know that chip
can't be reactivated?

109
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,740
Well, when you found
me at Strange's lab,

110
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,400
he was fixing it after a...

111
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,400
car battery mishap...

112
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,100
I-It's safe to say
that I think you shorted it out.

113
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,340
Let me look at that.

114
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,240
- What?
- Your neck.

115
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,910
That's gonna need stitches.
I have a first aid kit.

116
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,200
I need to keep moving.
Just name your fee.

117
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,950
Can't I just want to help?

118
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,150
Not you, not usually.

119
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,360
Friend of mine just tried to kill me.

120
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,020
I don't want anyone else
waiting for an excuse

121
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,250
- to stab me in the back.
- I gave you Gerry the Jerkwad,

122
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,840
and I'm letting you hide out in my club.

123
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,520
If I wanted to betray you,
I would have done it earlier.

124
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,270
So, where's that first aid kit?

125
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,830
Gonna make myself useful.

126
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,830
What's it gonna take
for you to trust me?

127
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:24,910
After everything you've done,
I honestly don't know.

128
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,750
I'd listen to her, Jim.

129
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,270
I hear trust is in short supply.

130
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,580
You forget your PSYOPS training, Jim?

131
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,560
Lesson one: when a person is in trouble,

132
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,590
they go to a familiar place.

133
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:50,340
Your ex-fiancée's bar was
just a stone's throw away,

134
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,270
so it's nice to finally
meet you, Barbara.

135
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,790
Screw you.

136
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,590
Hmm.

137
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,790
It seems you've lost your tail.

138
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,030
You mean the psychopath
you ordered to kill me?

139
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,570
You had your chance.

140
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,170
It could have been
like old times, buddy.

141
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,840
You, me, together,

142
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,510
making the world a better place.

143
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,650
- By murdering civilians?
- Civilians?

144
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,610
This hellhole is infested
with criminals and terrorists.

145
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,980
Sometimes you just have
to clean house, you know?

146
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,450
I won't let you.

147
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,380
It's not your call, Jim.

148
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,220
I'm not dead yet.

149
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:35,360
James Gordon,
I've been ordered to kill you.

150
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,970
Well, looks like you haven't
lost that tail after all.

151
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,700
If I die,

152
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,270
you'll never get the evidence!

153
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,600
Stand down.

154
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:03,450
I have evidence that you
and Walker are behind Haven.

155
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,450
If I die, it gets out
to the entire country.

156
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,660
It's time to make a deal.

157
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,160
You don't have any evidence.

158
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,890
Is that a risk you're willing to take?

159
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,860
It is.

160
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,770
Nygma, kill them both.

161
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,410
Bad time?

162
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,620
What do you want?

163
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,160
Depends.

164
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,760
What did <i>they</i> want?

165
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,330
Oh. A shot at me.

166
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,400
I killed Jeremiah Valeska.

167
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,100
So the rumors are true.

168
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,770
Yeah.

169
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,920
And now, every scumbag in town
wants to take me down

170
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,020
to make a name for themselves.

171
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,910
So I got to find a new squat.

172
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,380
How about, in exchange
for helping me find someone,

173
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,420
I let you crash in my citadel?

174
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,290
It's seen better days, but...

175
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,760
- ...then again, right?
- Who?

176
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,340
A miscreant I caught in the act
of stealing from me.

177
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,340
She was going to replace the stolen item

178
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:05,260
with an exact replica,
except the replica was a bomb.

179
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,500
Ring any bells?

180
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,340
White hair, feathered collar,

181
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,080
kind of of resembles a goth chicken?

182
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,910
You do know her.

183
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,320
She goes by the name Magpie.

184
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,420
What'd she steal?

185
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,120
The Russifer Diamond.

186
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,240
What makes you think I would help you

187
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,360
after you killed Tabitha in cold blood?

188
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,560
Because you believe
in an eye for an eye.

189
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,740
Hard as it may be to swallow,

190
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,200
Tabitha made her bed
when she killed my mother.

191
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,350
Tell you what.

192
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,350
I will help you

193
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,920
if I get to keep the diamond.

194
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,360
What?

195
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,560
Not a chance.

196
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,370
Ha, ha, ha. Then you'll never find her.

197
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:11,640
And every person in Gotham
will think it's okay

198
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,970
to steal from Penguin.

199
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,800
Is that what you want?

200
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,050
You know me too well.

201
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,550
Fine.

202
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,120
Good.

203
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,310
- What happened?
- I want every soldier

204
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,270
in the field looking for Jim Gordon.

205
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,750
Sir, we maxed out the holding cells.

206
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,370
We may need to keep men here
to control the overflow.

207
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,590
Ethan, Sumiko.

208
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,630
We're moving to phase two.

209
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,200
What in the hell's going on?

210
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,370
Listen up.

211
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,980
I am not here to play nice.

212
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,610
I am not here to hold anyone's hand.

213
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,320
I am here on a simple mission.

214
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,150
Any questions about the nature
of that mission?

215
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,790
Are you insane?
You can't just execute people.

216
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,440
Do not question me.

217
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,360
This is the mission.
If you don't like it,

218
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,330
you'll be locked up,
you'll remain locked up,

219
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,140
until we purge the criminal element

220
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,540
from the streets of Gotham.

221
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,180
Sir, Secretary Walker's on the radio.

222
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,400
We've moved on to phase two,
but we've lost track

223
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,100
of Gordon and Nygma.

224
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,400
I think Gordon found a way
to fry the chip.

225
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,970
<i>We can't have Nygma</i>

226
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,250
<i>in the wind with all that
evidence in his head.</i>

227
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,470
Just trust me. Once we find them...

228
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,820
<i>Don't bother.</i>

229
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,000
<i>I have an idea that will bring
Jim Gordon and Nygma to us.</i>

230
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,000
Thanks for getting everyone here.

231
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,650
And for the Wayne R and D.

232
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,100
Are you sure about including
Barbara Kean and Ed Nygma?

233
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,310
War makes for strange bedfellows.

234
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,660
It's good to have
a friend nearby, Bruce.

235
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,160
Ow! Would you be careful?

236
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,990
If you'll stop moving,
this will go a lot faster.

237
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,900
Well, if you would be more
careful, I wouldn't potato

238
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,230
all the long legs from the hidden spoon.

239
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,490
What just happened?

240
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,060
I believe the chip is installed
against his speech center.

241
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,270
Huh. Do it again.

242
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,870
The human brain is not
a plaything, Ms. Kean.

243
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,770
Please don't habituate the curtain rod.

244
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,830
And... ah.

245
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Stay.

246
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,820
There. How does that feel?

247
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,890
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

248
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,890
Oh, God. Thank you, Lucius.

249
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,090
So what exactly are we looking for?

250
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,130
Anything tying Walker or Eduardo
to the destruction of Haven.

251
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:39,200
Why would Walker kill all those people?

252
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,560
That's what we have to find out.

253
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,660
Oh, yes.

254
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,450
It appears the chip retains an audio log

255
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,330
of every verbal communication
with Nygma while he was under.

256
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,800
There's some damage, but...

257
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,630
if the command to attack
Haven is still here,

258
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,010
I can trace it back to the computer

259
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,140
from which it originated.

260
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,650
It has to be Walker.

261
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:03,350
They won't be able to sweep
this under the rug anymore.

262
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,730
Are you out there, Jim?

263
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,000
What do you want?

264
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,520
We have someone here...

265
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,070
...who wants to say hello.

266
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,700
<i>J-Jim? What's happening?</i>

267
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,430
Lee?

268
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,009
We found the Queen of the Narrows

269
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,090
in a run-down hidey-hole
on the north side. Tell me,

270
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,710
<i>how many ex-fiancées
do you have, anyway?</i>

271
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,500
Leave her out of this.
She's not involved.

272
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,410
<i>Ah, but she's a criminal,
and all criminals in Gotham</i>

273
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,250
are now under a death sentence.

274
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,790
<i>But what happens next is up to you.</i>

275
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,630
A trade, perhaps.

276
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,320
Lee Thompkins for Ed Nygma.

277
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,650
Fine.

278
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,770
Good. Bring Nygma to the GCPD now.

279
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,380
No, we meet at Haven.

280
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,520
I want you to see
the carnage you've caused.

281
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,400
<i>Always so emotional.</i>

282
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,680
That's not how wars are won, Jim.

283
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,560
Those are my terms. Take it or leave it.

284
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,740
Okay. I'll play your game.

285
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,260
What are you doing?

286
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,310
He's never gonna
let you walk out of there.

287
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,630
I don't recall volunteering
as a trading chit!

288
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,670
He doesn't want Ed. He wants the chip.

289
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,290
So I'll give him the chip.

290
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,080
Bruce, do you have any contacts
in the mainland press?

291
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,670
Several.

292
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,810
What would it take to broadcast
the information from the chip

293
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,060
- to the mainland?
- A transmitter, which I have,

294
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,360
and a very large antenna,
which I do not.

295
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,690
I know where there's an antenna
in the Green Zone,

296
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,830
but you're not gonna like it.

297
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,060
The roof of the GCPD.

298
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,090
Lee.

299
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,370
- Harvey.
- Where the hell have you been?

300
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,710
You've been gone for months.

301
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,940
I don't know.

302
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,410
I can't remember anything.

303
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,010
What happened to me?

304
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,420
I don't know. We're gonna figure it out.

305
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,650
I promise.

306
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,050
Let's go.

307
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,970
It's gonna be okay.

308
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,620
<i>Eduardo just arrived.</i>

309
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,610
<i>He brought backup, like we expected.</i>

310
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,210
- <i>Time to move.</i>
- Copy that.

311
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,280
Let's go.

312
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,760
Jim! Who are these people?

313
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,150
I'm gonna get you out of here, Lee.

314
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,660
I'm not sure that's true, Jim.

315
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,370
It seems you forgot to bring someone.

316
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,940
It's hard to make a swap
when you have nothing to trade.

317
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,010
We both know this
is really what you want.

318
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,190
Proof that you and Walker
are responsible

319
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,730
for the destruction of Haven

320
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,620
and the murder of hundreds
of innocent people.

321
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,160
Now let her go.

322
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,390
Let me guess, you made a copy

323
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,840
so you can do this little bit
of theatrics for me.

324
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,740
I expected more from you, Jim.

325
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:34,440
Three soldiers against one man
without a gun.

326
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,490
You sure you brought enough help?

327
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,120
I don't need any help.

328
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:44,020
Is that why you sent Nygma
to do your dirty work?

329
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,800
So he could pick up your slack
like I used to?

330
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,010
Still dining out on pulling me
from that burning truck.

331
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,120
I carried more than my fair share.

332
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,770
I was always the first man in.

333
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,740
Your recklessness got people killed.

334
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,060
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

335
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,110
Ramirez?

336
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,170
No.

337
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,670
Johnson.

338
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,990
Bolton.

339
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,570
Their deaths were not on me.

340
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,610
Yeah.

341
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,790
Put a bullet in my mouth and shut me up.

342
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,260
No.

343
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,000
Not a bullet.

344
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,220
But I am gonna shut your mouth.

345
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,110
Once and for all.

346
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,910
Come try.

347
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,110
- You sure this is the place?
- Yep.

348
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,470
This is the place.

349
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,140
Stop her!

350
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,560
Ouchie. You're quick.

351
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,680
I know you?

352
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,310
- Doubt it.
- Uh-huh.

353
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,750
You killed Jeremiah. You're famous.

354
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,040
Not so scary.

355
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,510
I could be famous.

356
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,260
You want a shot at me, too?

357
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,650
Unfortunately, you won't
have the opportunity.

358
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,190
Careful.

359
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,160
This is my workshop

360
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,190
where I make my boom-booms.

361
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,130
Anything here, boom, boom.
Then more boom

362
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,160
and more boom, then the whole room...

363
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,750
- Boom, boom. We get it.
- You're bluffing.

364
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:31,830
Catch.

365
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,440
Ooh! No, no!

366
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,950
Whoops!

367
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,050
That watch must have been an original,

368
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,610
but other stuff in there, boom, boom.

369
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,250
Good luck.

370
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,400
We tie our shoelaces together,

371
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,600
then we lasso the keys off the desk.

372
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:05,130
And then what, Roy Rogers, huh?
They surrender in awe?

373
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,700
No harebrained scheme is
gonna get us out of this.

374
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,570
Hello!

375
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,080
Hope you don't mind, I...

376
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,290
borrowed some cop stuff from the garage.

377
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,720
Oh, boy, you can put your guns down.

378
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,840
Kevlar in this thing
is designed to withstand a blast

379
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,450
that can tear down a building
twice this size.

380
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,520
What is that?

381
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,860
Is it not obvious?

382
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,540
It's a bomb!

383
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,240
Okay.

384
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,010
Let's play a game.

385
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,540
- Clear out.
- Ah, ah, ah, ah.

386
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,450
If anyone leaves this building,
this thing blows.

387
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,120
You gomers messed with
the wrong super genius,

388
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,460
and now it's time for a little payback.

389
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,820
Nygma, you're a son of a bitch!

390
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,340
Oh, not now, Bullock.

391
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,420
The body count at Haven
wasn't big enough for you, huh?

392
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,870
Shut up!

393
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,660
What's your game?

394
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,090
The only way to deactivate this bomb

395
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,070
is to put a four-digit code
on the keypad there.

396
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,660
What's the code?

397
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:19,600
The pallid beach mouse
can give birth every four weeks.

398
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,900
Assuming we start with two mice,

399
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,950
and that the size
of an average litter is 12 mice,

400
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:30,640
and that they are equally
split male to female,

401
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,610
how many pallid beach mice

402
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:38,210
would we have at the end of one year?

403
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:44,390
The answer to that question is the code.

404
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,400
Oh, I almost forgot.

405
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,790
You have two minutes.

406
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:53,200
After that, everyone in here goes splat.

407
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,980
Except for me, of course.

408
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,560
I'm in position.

409
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,500
Copy. Plug the recorder
to the transmitter.

410
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,500
Next, you'll connect
the transmitter to the radio.

411
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,610
There should be a black box
at the base of the antenna.

412
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,050
Let me know when you get it open.

413
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,140
Nygma's bomb ploy won't last forever.

414
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,810
We just have to wait for
the exhaust fans to come

415
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,710
to a complete stop before
you can use the gas.

416
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,050
What are you doing?

417
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,590
You want to take responsibility
for people dying?

418
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,890
Look around.

419
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,420
This is all on you.

420
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,060
What the hell does that mean?

421
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,790
Walker spent months

422
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,400
trying to convince
her superiors that Gotham

423
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,630
was overrun by criminals.

424
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,770
We were this close to being sent in

425
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,000
when you set up Haven.

426
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,940
The fact that one man was able

427
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,680
to safely house and rescue hundreds

428
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,110
of innocent civilians
showed the military higher-ups

429
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,210
that the criminal element of Gotham

430
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,480
must not be so big and scary after all.

431
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,990
They were ready to send in relief,

432
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,990
so it had to come down.

433
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:51,090
Why? What the hell does she want?

434
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,200
They were innocent people, children.

435
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,800
They were an acceptable loss
for the mission.

436
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,240
What mission, damn it?

437
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,620
That's enough.

438
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,050
Take her out back and shoot her.

439
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,330
He doesn't need to see this.

440
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,900
It's my gift to you,

441
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,950
a small mercy.

442
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:43,010
You never should have
brought her into this, Eduardo.

443
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,020
Can we speed things along,
please, Mr. Fox?

444
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,870
The exhaust fans have to wind down

445
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,400
before they can change directions.

446
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,410
If you throw the canisters in
now, the gas will blow outside.

447
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,440
Bruce, status?

448
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,850
One second.

449
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,380
I'm here. The box is open.

450
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,160
<i>Two dark green wires right in front.</i>

451
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,460
<i>Attach those to the transmitter.
The message will send.</i>

452
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,800
It's done.

453
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,040
One minute left.

454
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,670
Everybody hear that?

455
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:49,330
One minute before this thing explodes.

456
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,260
I know the answer.

457
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,450
Uh... Nope, don't think you do, Bullock.

458
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,470
My high school zoology class is
still rattling around up here.

459
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,260
High school was a long time ago,

460
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,930
so let's just take
the full minute, shall we?

461
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,530
Really think about it.

462
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,930
I don't need to.

463
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,790
The pallid beach mouse is extinct.

464
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:13,260
It disappeared in 1959.

465
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,260
The number you'll have at
the end of the year is zero.

466
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:19,310
The number is zero. Trust me on this.

467
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,580
I got in trouble. I had to
write an essay about it.

468
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,970
I swear to God.

469
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,300
Oh, dear.

470
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,960
I got a math problem for you.

471
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,710
Count these bullets.

472
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,490
Yes!

473
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,690
You want to know why

474
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,550
Ramirez and the rest didn't make it out?

475
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,530
After your tour of duty was up,

476
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,400
we were caught behind enemy lines,

477
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,630
taken to the darkest hell on Earth...

478
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,990
Peña Duro.

479
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,220
Have you heard of it?

480
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:34,730
Prison? I didn't know.

481
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:37,130
No one did,

482
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,470
'cause it's where we were
left to die by our government.

483
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,140
I was the only one that survived.

484
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,440
Walker...

485
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,480
Walker, she found me in that place.

486
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,710
She pulled me out.

487
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:51,110
She gave me a new purpose.

488
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,710
She made you her killer.

489
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,740
No, no, Jim.

490
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,620
She's the killer.

491
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:00,390
And you have no idea.

492
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,970
Lee?

493
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,910
You and your stupid revenge.

494
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,060
The diamond isn't even worth
anything in Gotham anyway.

495
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,090
Unless...

496
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:54,460
The diamond is worth
something on the mainland.

497
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:57,980
And I bet you have

498
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:01,610
way more where that came from.

499
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,510
You're leaving Gotham.

500
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,710
Congratulations, you're a genius.

501
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,480
Why?

502
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,420
"Alexander the Great

503
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,920
"then looked upon his land

504
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,550
"and wept.

505
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,690
For there was nothing left to conquer."

506
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,930
I've done all I can in Gotham.

507
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,840
Some things twice.

508
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,570
There's nothing left
for me here anymore.

509
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,740
I want in.

510
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:46,530
I can't even walk around the city

511
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,850
without some lowlife
trying to take me out.

512
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,950
Just so he can up his cred.

513
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,620
I don't want to be the person
who killed Jeremiah Valeska.

514
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,560
I just want to be myself.

515
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:03,240
And I can't do that in Gotham anymore.

516
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,340
My heart weeps for you.

517
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,370
But no.

518
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,270
What if I could get us out of here?

519
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,850
You do that, I will cut you in.

520
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,310
50-50.

521
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:21,620
Ten percent, and I won't murder you

522
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,520
- once we reach the mainland.
- Deal.

523
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,890
Selina, wait!

524
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:36,970
She said, "Anything in the room
could be a bomb."

525
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,870
Not the room itself.

526
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:43,580
- Did you know that the whole time?
- Just thought of it.

527
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,970
We should hurry before

528
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,520
she gets away with all our stuff.

529
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,440
Don't worry.

530
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,780
She won't get far.

531
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:55,320
Alvarez, take Lee to my office.

532
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,190
Be right there.

533
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,570
I got to be honest with you, man.

534
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,560
I don't know how many more
of these close calls

535
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,040
this old heart can take.

536
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,560
We were able to transmit the audio logs,

537
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,170
but until I hear back from my contacts,

538
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,660
I won't know if they received them.

539
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,030
Well, if they did,

540
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,630
probably have a lot of questions.

541
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,580
We'll spend the night and help out.

542
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,530
Alfred can go back to the
apartment and grab what you can?

543
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,450
Certainly, Master Bruce.

544
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,470
Thanks, Bruce.

545
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,190
The next time I get a short straw,

546
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,910
I'm just gonna walk into traffic.

547
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,920
Where has Lee been this whole time?

548
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,520
I don't know.

549
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,320
I'm not gonna wait around

550
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,940
to watch their touching reunion.

551
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,410
What is happening here?

552
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,600
I don't know where to start.

553
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,110
When I didn't hear from you,

554
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:53,130
I'd hoped you'd gotten out of Gotham.

555
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,680
The last thing that I remember

556
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,650
is Jeremiah destroying the bridges.

557
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,870
That was over three months ago.

558
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,420
Three months? Oh, my God.

559
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,260
You don't remember anything?

560
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,560
I'm trying, and...

561
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:12,330
Right before the bridges came down,

562
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,330
you said you were leaving the city.

563
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,830
- Why didn't you?
- I don't know, Jim.

564
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,100
None of this is making any sense.

565
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:22,840
We're still cut off.

566
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:25,540
There's no help.

567
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,610
It's been hard.

568
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,750
Actually, that's not true.

569
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,050
It's been hell.

570
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,310
People needed hope,

571
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,350
so I put on a brave face.

572
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,380
Pretended I knew what to do.

573
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,730
But you know me, Lee.

574
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,490
I'm just a cop.

575
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,620
And now I'm really lost.

576
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:54,150
Hey, it's okay.

577
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,310
We're here now.

578
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:03,050
We'll just try to put
the pieces back together again.

579
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,310
Maybe we can help each other.

580
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,920
Let's start with my memory.

581
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,660
I went back to the Narrows.

582
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,660
I saw Ed.

583
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:20,460
We fought. We...

584
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,840
Oh.

585
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,200
He stabbed me.

586
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,950
- What?
- Wait, let me remember.

587
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:30,400
I stabbed him.

588
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:33,140
There was so much blood.

589
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:38,110
Then I was...

590
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,220
somewhere...

591
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,520
A hospital, maybe?

592
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,050
Eduardo.

593
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,050
So much potential,

594
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,420
but not quite up to the task.

595
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,499
Walker.

596
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,300
How?

597
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,360
We've been burned.

598
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,030
The press have recordings of me

599
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,060
instructing Nygma to take down Haven.

600
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:29,050
I thought I might accomplish my task

601
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,290
without setting foot in this foul city,

602
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,210
but that's not to be.

603
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,760
You won't die yet, my warrior.

604
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:42,030
There is so much more for you to do.

605
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,500
Professor Strange will have you
fixed up in no time.

606
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,910
Jim Gordon.

607
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,550
Don't worry about Gordon.

608
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:03,020
Nygma was never alone.

609
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:06,180
There was a second operative.

610
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:12,910
You okay?

611
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,980
You cold?

612
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,320
The hospitals were
all out of commission.

613
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:24,030
Just the one clinic in the green zone.

614
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,070
Lee?

615
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,910
Time to die, Jim Gordon.

616
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,250
Ah...

617
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,030
Wanted: one butler.

618
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,120
Military background a plus.

619
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,530
References required.

620
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,760
Yes, Mr. Pennyworth.

621
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,770
I have a job for you.

622
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,890
Well, you weren't lying when you said

623
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,300
she wouldn't get far.

624
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:16,440
Pretty crown's... booby-trapped.

625
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,400
Ouch.

626
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,040
Ouch, indeed.

627
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,620
I couldn't have you coming back here

628
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,970
and making off with
all of my belongings.

629
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,990
Our belongings.

630
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,600
Cut my wings, let me go?

631
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,910
Bang, bang.

632
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,040
What the hell?

633
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,730
The buckshot in her gut
wasn't enough punishment?

634
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,740
Just a little reminder of what happens

635
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,730
when people try to steal from me.

636
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,370
Good to know.

637
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,340
Partner.

638
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,990
So Lee has a chip, too?

639
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,700
I don't know how, but it seems that way.

640
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,860
Walker must have been holding onto her

641
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,630
as some sort of plan B this whole time.

642
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,510
Three months? That's a hell
of a long game she's playing.

643
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,710
Which means she probably has
other tricks up her sleeve.

644
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,710
Hey.

645
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,990
- Welcome back.
- Oh, hell.

646
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:21,720
This is gonna keep happening.

647
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,600
What's wrong with me?

648
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,360
The good news is, I think
I can actually answer that.

649
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,340
Jim.

650
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,650
I need to talk to you.

651
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,910
Now is not a good time, Barbara.

652
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,350
Don't you remember the good time
we had the other night?

653
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,970
- Over there?
- Say what?

654
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,650
You need to leave now.

655
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,890
I'm pregnant.

656
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,660
Good to see you, Lee.

657
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,390
Long time.

658
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,070
Congratulations?

659
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,850
You.

660
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,380
You're supposed to be dead, mate.

661
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,140
Sorry to disappoint.

662
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:20,090
You hurt my boy...

663
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,190
and I will bite your face off.

664
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,160
Yeah. Yeah.

665
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,240
Ah... Bruce will be along shortly.

666
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,830
In the meantime...

667
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,270
This place is in desperate need

668
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:42,360
of some good, old-fashioned butlering.

669
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,960
How did you even find a way off
the bloody island anyway?

670
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,690
How?

671
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,900
One if by land, two if by sea,

672
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,960
three if by digging
a tunnel under the river.

673
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:58,960
But enough questions.

674
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,940
Today is the big day.

675
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:11,750
