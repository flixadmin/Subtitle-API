00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:54,206
TO THE MOST INSANE
CONCLUSION POSSIBLE.

159
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:57,751
SO THAT'S...THAT'S
A NO FOR THE RECORD?

160
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:01,838
NO. FOR THE RECORD.

161
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,006
WELL, GOOD

162
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,632
BECAUSE I THINK
OUR RELATIONSHIP

163
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,343
IS COMPLICATED
ENOUGH ALREADY

164
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:07,510
JUST WITH YOU
BEING MAYOR.

165
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,845
YEAH, SO DO I.

166
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,555
ASSISTANT: MR. MAYOR,
EVERYONE'S WAITING.

167
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,973
I HAVE TO GO
TO THIS CEREMONY.

168
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,058
-OF COURSE.
-CAN I SHOW YOU OUT?

169
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,226
MM-HMM.

170
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,605
SO I FIGURE THAT WE
TAKE GREGOR OUT

171
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,481
AT THE BATH HOUSE
BECAUSE HE'S GONNA

172
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,858
HAVE THE LEAST NUMBER
OF MEN GUARDING HIM,

173
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,818
AND...AND QUITE FRANKLY,
WE CAN BE SURE

174
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,779
THAT HE'S NOT...
PACKING.

175
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,407
ANYWAY, HE HAS MEN
HERE AND HERE AND HERE.

176
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,242
-NO, NO, NO, NO.
-NO WHAT?

177
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:34,079
BATH HOUSE IS
GREGOR'S TURF.

178
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,622
-YOU CANNOT DO IT ON YOUR OWN.
-OK.

179
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,916
-WE NEED ARMY.
-WELL, THEN WHO CAN WE TRUST,

180
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,585
ANATOLY, BECAUSE WE'RE
BASICALLY TALKING
ABOUT A COUP.

181
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:44,047
OHH. LYING HERE
WITH MY ASS HANGING
OUT LIKE BABY.

182
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,548
[GROANS]

183
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,634
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT MY MEN.

184
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,511
-THEY ARE LOYAL TO ME.
-SO AM I,

185
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,180
AND LOOK.

186
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,266
I AM GONNA STAY HERE

187
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,310
UNTIL WE TAKE OUT
GREGOR

188
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,603
AND WE PROTECT
THE BRATVA.

189
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,272
TY SKAZAL, "STAY"?

190
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:01,856
WERE YOU GOING
TO LEAVE?

191
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,234
LOOK, ANATOLY.
I REALIZED

192
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:07,446
I HAVE TO GET BACK
TO MY LIFE,

193
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,573
BUT THEN I SAW WHAT
GREGOR DID TO YOU
BECAUSE OF ME.

194
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:14,411
YOU ARE SIN-EATER,
OLIVER.

195
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:17,038
IN SOME CULTURES,
IS...IS GUY WHO LIVES

196
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,916
ON THE EDGE OF VILLAGE,

197
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,252
AND, UH, WHEN
SOMEBODY DIES,

198
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:23,878
THEY PUT BODY THERE
AND COVER

199
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,298
WITH FRUITS
AND VEGETABLES,

200
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,008
AND HE EATS THAT.

201
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,843
HE EATS THEIR SINS?

202
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:33,305
YES. SO THEY GO ON
TO THE AFTERLIFE

203
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:38,685
IF HE TAKES THEIR SINS
AS HIS OWN.

204
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,479
YOU...YOU ARE VERY MUCH...

205
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,565
WHAT?

206
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,942
FOR THE PAST 10 MINUTES,
I'VE SEEN

207
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,861
THE SAME ORDERLY PASS
BY 5 TIMES

208
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,155
WITH AN EMPTY STRETCHER.

209
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,449
COULD BE ONE
OF GREGOR'S MEN.

210
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:53,867
AT ANY RATE, THEY KNOW
THAT YOU ARE BACK.

211
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,577
OR THEY'RE JUST HERE TO
FINISH THE JOB ON YOU.

212
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,163
EITHER WAY...

213
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,540
ANATOLY: IT IS TIME FOR ME
TO...KAK TY SKAKHESH'...

214
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,916
STRETCH MY LEGS.

215
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,877
-ALL RIGHT. COME ON.
-THANK YOU.

216
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,545
AND I WILL ALWAYS
HAVE THE COURAGE

217
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,340
TO HELP MYSELF
AND OTHERS ACCOUNTABLE
FOR OUR ACTIONS.

218
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:09,799
OLIVER: I WILL ALWAYS
UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION,

219
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,386
MY COMMUNITY,
AND THE AGENCY I SERVE.

220
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,221
I WILL ALWAYS UPHOLD
THE CONSTITUTION,

221
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,224
MY COMMUNITY,
AND THE AGENCY
WHICH I SERVE.

222
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,726
WELCOME TO THE SCPD,
OFFICER DRAKE.

223
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,730
[APPLAUSE]

224
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,321
IS EVERYTHING OK
WITH SUSAN?

225
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:33,198
YEAH. W-WHY?

226
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,326
JUST, YOU KNOW, YOUR
ASSISTANT WAS CLOCKING
A LITTLE TENSION, SO...

227
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:39,162
THEA, IS...IS
MY ASSISTANT
YOUR MOLE?

228
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,498
I LIKE TO THINK
OF HIM MORE AS,
LIKE, MY INFORMANT,

229
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,335
BUT WHAT'S...WHAT'S
GOING ON?

230
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,462
SUSAN ASKED ME IF I WAS
THE GREEN ARROW?

231
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,881
WAIT. WHAT DID YOU
SAY TO HER?

232
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,592
I HANDLED IT.
I...I'VE BEEN DOING THIS

233
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,010
FOR A LITTLE WHILE NOW.

234
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,929
QUENTIN: CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE, PLEASE?

235
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,722
QUENTIN, IF I DELAY
THIS VOTE ANY MORE, I'M
GONNA GET IMPEACHED.

236
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:01,017
LISTEN TO ME. LIZA WARNER
ESCAPED LAST NIGHT.

237
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,227
OLIVER: AND CHINA WHITE
AND CARRIE CUTTER.

238
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,480
WE'RE ON IT.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

239
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,148
WE ARE ON IT SOONER
THAN I THOUGHT.

240
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,733
FELICITY HAS
THEIR LOCATION.

241
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,235
GREAT.
WHERE AM I GOING?

242
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,404
I HAVE PUT ALL 3 OF THESE
WOMEN AWAY, QUENTIN.

243
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,821
THIS IS NOTHING THE TEAM
CAN'T HANDLE.

244
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,407
MM-HMM. YEAH.
I KNOW THAT,

245
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:17,200
BUT THIS IS
PERSONAL, OLIVER.

246
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,410
[SIGHS]

247
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,252
QUENTIN: SEEMS LIKE
WE'RE A LITTLE LATE.

248
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,003
[SIGHS]

249
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,631
LOOKS LIKE CHINA WHITE
HAD A FALLING OUT
WITH THE TRIAD.

250
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,133
THIS IS MORE THAN
JUST A FALLING OUT.

251
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,051
THIS IS A MASSACRE.

252
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,846
OVERWATCH, ALL WE'VE
GOT HERE ARE BODIES

253
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,723
AND A SECURITY CAMERA.

254
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:41,808
ON IT.

255
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,609
THAT'S WARNER.

256
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,278
THIS ISN'T
ON YOU, QUENTIN.

257
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,862
I'M NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THAT,

258
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,114
BUT EITHER WAY,
WE GOT TO STOP
WHATEVER IT IS

259
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,698
THESE WOMEN
ARE UP TO

260
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,367
BEFORE MORE BODIES
DROP.

261
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,039
CHUCANG ZAI NALI.

262
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,250
HUH?!

263
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,460
UNH!

264
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,633
SO SHE SAID, "WHERE IS
THE DEPOSITORY?"

265
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,468
I DON'T THINK
SHE GOT HER ANSWER.

266
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,094
WHAT DEPOSITORY IS
SHE TALKING ABOUT?

267
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,388
WELL, I MEAN, THE WORD
COULD ALSO MEAN STORAGE.

268
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,681
JOHN: SO THE 3 OF THEM
ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
THE TRIAD IS STORING?

269
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,142
WELL, THAT COULD
MEAN ANYTHING.

270
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,435
THE TRIAD'S GOT
STASHES ALL OVER
THE CITY.

271
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,228
WHATEVER THESE 3
ARE LOOKING FOR,

272
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,647
THEY JUST KILLED
AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE
TRYING TO FIND IT.

273
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,524
WE WANT THEM TO STOP
DROPPING BODIES,

274
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,108
WE GOT TO FIND IT FIRST.

275
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:44,829
GO! COME ON! GO!

276
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,257
REGRETTING YOUR
CHOICE NOT TO
GO HOME?

277
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,551
NOT YET!

278
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,563
COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON.

279
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,401
THAT COUP AGAINST GREGOR

280
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,986
MIGHT BE SHORT-LIVED...
LIKE US.

281
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,080
THIS JUST ARRIVED, BOSS.

282
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,248
-WHAT IS IT?
-NO IDEA,

283
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,790
BUT IT SAID,
"URGENT," SO...

284
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,840
CHAPMAN, I WANT
THE ENTIRE ACU

285
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,718
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM
IN 5 MINUTES.

286
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,097
HEY! LONG TIME,
NO SEE.

287
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,682
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
DOWN HERE?

288
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:48,851
OH, JUST SOME
DAMAGE CONTROL.
YOU HAVE A MINUTE?

289
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,437
YEAH, FOR YOU
ANYTHING.

290
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,940
-WHAT'S UP?
-WELL, IT'S, UM, SUSAN WILLIAMS.

291
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,276
-HMM.
-SHE'S SUSPECTING

292
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,985
THAT OLIVER'S
THE GREEN ARROW.

293
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,364
WHY? I MEAN, OTHER
THAN THE FACT THAT
HE IS, BUT WHY?

294
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,284
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, HE SAYS

295
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,702
THAT SHE CONFRONTED
HIM ABOUT IT,

296
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,786
AND THEN HE CLAIMS
HE PUT IT TO BED,

297
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,830
BUT SHE'S NOT JUST
GONNA DROP THIS.

298
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,833
AGREED. WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO?

299
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,252
HACK INTO HER COMPUTER

300
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,962
AND...AND FIND OUT WHAT'S
THERE AND DELETE IT.

301
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,171
YEAH, COPY THAT.

302
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,466
SUSAN WILLIAMS' COMPUTER.

303
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,967
-I'M IN.
-THAT WAS FAST.

304
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,136
YEAH. WELL, HER PASSWORD
IS 1-2-3-4,

305
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,221
AND SHE HAS A FILE HERE
NAMED "OLIVER QUEEN INFO"

306
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,848
BECAUSE SHE'S
SUPERORIGINAL.

307
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,059
-WHOA.
-OH, GOD.

308
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,437
-SHE...SHE HAS...
-EVERYTHING.

309
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,397
-SHE'S BEEN CONNECTING THE DOTS.
-THIS ENTIRE TIME.

310
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,149
WE HAVE TO DELETE
ALL THIS.

311
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,692
