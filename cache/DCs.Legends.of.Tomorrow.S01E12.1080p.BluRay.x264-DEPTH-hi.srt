00:00:03,797 --> 00:00:06,132
<i>an immortal tyrant

4
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:10,127

7

You and your band of rogues have

20

A team is a liability.

21
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:47,132
The Time Masters have issued
Omega Protocols on all of us.

22
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:48,299
They've sent the Pilgrim.

23
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:49,467
Who's the Pilgrim?

24
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:51,970
The Pilgrim is the Time Masters'
most deadly assassin.

25
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:54,305

- RORY: <i>What did you tell him?</i>

56
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,564
That we work for a secret agency
called A.R.G.U.S.

57
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:51,589
I think he bought it.

58
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:53,466
Of course, he did.
He's an idiot.

59
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:56,135
Hey, no offense,

60
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:57,971
but do you really think
it's a good idea

61
00:02:58,137 --> 00:02:59,177
to leave him unsupervised?

62
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:02,809
You're right, have fun.

63
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:04,978
- You seem calm.
- You mean considering

64
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:06,563
a temporal bounty hunter
is trying

65
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,356
to murder our younger selves?

00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,901
I was gonna put it a little more
delicately than that, but yeah.

67
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:13,462
I think at some point,
you just learn

68

(SCOFFS)

72
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:25,957
So, it seems like
you decided to ignore

73
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:27,417
the advice from Old-West-you,

74
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:28,585
about not being with Ray.

75
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:31,212
Ignoring her advice about Ray
was your advice. Remember?

76
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,381
Don't listen to my advice.

77
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:35,633
So, did you tell him
what she said?

78
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,135
Oh, sure.

79
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:40,138

the women I met in 1871 was me.

"And she told me
our love was doomed

"to fail
because you're not Carter."

82

So, that was a "no"?

83
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:46,477
Look, Ray and I
are happy together.

84
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:48,205
We should be able to enjoy that
before I have to drop

85
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:50,148
the whole doomed-love-affair
thing on his head.

86

and communication? (GAGS)

Believe me, a relationship based
on an ancient Egyptian curse

89
00:03:57,822 --> 00:03:58,990
doesn't work much better.

(CLANGING)

91
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:04,829
Mr. Rory, how are you feeling?
I mean, your younger self.

92
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:06,539
Jax is watching him.

93
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:08,833
That young man, you,
just lost his family,

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,919
you might want
a shoulder to cry on.

95
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:14,505
I don't cry, Professor. Oh, and,
Haircut, thanks for saving me.

96
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:15,673
You're welcome.

97
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,984
You know what I don't get is,

98
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:18,569
why doesn't the Pilgrim
just go back a week earlier

99
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:19,673
and kill younger Rory then?

100
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:21,679
Because the Omega Protocol
calls for precision.

101
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:23,157
Multiple attempts
from the Pilgrim

102
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:24,766
could do irreparable
temporal damage.

103
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:26,293
Which means
she's only got one shot

104
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:27,751
at killing each
and every one of us.

105
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:29,604
And we only have
one shot to extract

106
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:31,211
your younger selves
from the timeline

107
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:32,690

Gideon, run another scan for the
whereabouts of the Pilgrim.

163
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:03,341
GIDEON: <i>I'm sorry, sir, the timeline
shows no temporal distortions.</i>

164
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:05,510
<i>I seem to be unable
to track the Pilgrim.</i>

165
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:08,638
- That doesn't sound good.
- No. It's quite the opposite.

166
00:07:08,805 --> 00:07:10,925
Without a way to track
the whereabouts of the Pilgrim,

167
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:15,478
she could target any one of you
at any point in time.

168
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,527
Gideon was tracking
the Pilgrim's temporal wake.

169
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:23,893
I didn't think it was possible

170
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:25,696
to conceal one's movements
through time.

171
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,783
Well, it is if the Time Masters
are on your side.

172
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:28,866
How does this all work?

173
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,536
She can travel to any place,
any time?

174
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,538
She could be killing any of us
right now.

175
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:36,165
- And if we die in the past--
- You die in the present.

176
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:37,708
RAY: <i>Wow, this is so interesting.</i>

177
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,877
How long does it take
for what happens in the past

178
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:41,212
to affect the present?

179
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:43,440
Could I be dead right now
and not know it?

180
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:44,715
Maybe I am dead right now.

181
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:46,551
RAY: <i>Hello?</i>

182
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,553
- Can anybody hear me?
- No.

183
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,359
Look, the important thing
is not to panic.

184
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:51,824
Somebody is playing
Russian roulette

185
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:53,641
with our younger selves,
why would we panic?

186
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:55,226
Well, there are
a few exceptions.

187
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:56,894
Kendra's ability to reincarnate

188
00:07:57,061 --> 00:08:00,106
means that it would the Pilgrim
no good to target her.

189
00:08:00,273 --> 00:08:01,816
And, as a former Time Master,

190
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:03,776
<i>to remove me from history</i>

191
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:05,945
would be quite dangerous
to the timeline.

192
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,239
Well, that's convenient.

193
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,575
And what's that
supposed to mean?

194
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,076
Nothing. It just occurs to me,

195
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:15,163
you've never told us
about your past, Rip.

196
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,582
And I don't trust a man
with secrets.

197
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:20,418
Look, the less information
you have to offer on me,

198
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:24,088
the less valuable you are
to our now numerous enemies.

199
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:27,592
- Like I said, <i>convenient.</i>
- Are they fighting?

200
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:30,344
This is not a fight, it's merely
an exchange of ideas.

201
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:31,929
No, not you. Them!

202
00:08:33,598 --> 00:08:34,765
(CHUCKLES)

203
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:36,934
She slapped me.

204
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:39,246
The little weirdo said that
he liked the way that I smell.

205
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,350
I'm usually a lot smoother,

206
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:42,023
but I'm sort of freaking out
right now.

207
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,941
You, hands to yourself.

208
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:45,508
And next time,
hit with a flat palm.

209
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:47,612
And, you...

210
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:50,948
You're not her type. Now,
do I need to separate you two?

211
00:08:52,325 --> 00:08:53,409
No.

212
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,871
Hey, when do I get to go home?

213
00:08:57,038 --> 00:08:59,123
You're safer here, trust me.

214
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,793
Well, where is here?
And why do you look like me?

215
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,105
Please, will you just tell me
what the hell is going on?

216
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:06,964
Look, it's safer for you
if I don't.

217
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:09,592
And we look alike because...

218
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:14,472
Because we're like family,
and I need you to trust me.

219
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:17,475
Look, my dad,
he's gonna be freaking out.

220
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:20,353
- If he ever lost me--
- He won't lose you.

221
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:21,812
Ever.

222
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,441
I promise.

223
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:34,325
Hey.

224
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:36,327
Hey.

225
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:38,162
Did you know that
Rip has a secret stash

226
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:39,538
of vintage cereals?

227
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:41,274
Fruit Brute
was always my favorite.

228
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,167
Are you okay?

229
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:44,669
I'm a little on edge.

230
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,683
You know, we've been
through a lot together

231
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:50,925
and you've never quite resorted
to eating sugary cereals.

232
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:54,345
RAY: <i>Look...</i>

233
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:56,632
I've spent a lot of my life
thinking about the future.

234
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,558
And now, I have to think
about the past,

235
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,852
just sometimes
the present and...

236
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:06,941
The point is, do you know where
I go to when things get crazy?

237
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:09,151
Which, for us, is always.

238
00:10:11,696 --> 00:10:13,322
I go to those two years
in Hub City

239
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:15,574
<i>when it was just you and me.</i>

240
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,868
And it felt like we had forever.

241
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:19,704
Yeah.

242
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,081
That's what kept me grounded.

243
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:28,379
In fact, seconds before
Rip and the team came back,

244
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:30,548
I was about-- (GROANS)

245

KENDRA: <i>Ray!</i>

- My God!

247
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:36,387
What's wrong?

248
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:38,472
Oh, my God!

249
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:40,891
Gideon, we need help! Ray...

Who's doing this?

GIDEON: <i>A deep scan

<i>In the vicinity

I'm no one.
We have that in common.

(GROANS) What is that thing?
Who is she? Who are you?

266
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:35,112
No time to explain!

(COUGHS)

269
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:44,205
Rip and the team

270
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:45,873
and I'm here now.

00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,920
However long we have,
I wanna spend it with you.

They did it.

(STRAINING) Actually, I think
you get most of the credit.

278
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:16,153
Couldn't miss spending
the rest of our lives together.

I meant it, Ray.

I love you.

282
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,538
I guess you found the ring.

00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,498
The ring?

284
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:37,341
Kind of a strange way
to get engaged, but

285
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,387
I'll take it.

(EXHALES)

287
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:49,228
What the Pilgrim did,

288
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:51,188
the way she turned our attacks
back on us.

289
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:52,857
It's as if she
was reversing time.

290
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,703
It's called,
"Temporal Micro Manipulation."

291
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:57,069
The ability to control time
in one's immediate vicinity.

292
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:59,613
We are lucky
to have saved Dr. Palmer.

293
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,033
So, basically, we have no idea
who she's going after next.

294
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,201
We know it's not Rip,

295
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:06,912
because he doesn't have a past
to go back to.

296
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,639
Gideon, prepare
for multiple time jumps.

297
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:11,041

00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:14,420
My birthday? Why are we--

300
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:16,690
The only way to ensure you
are not harmed in your past--

301
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:19,216
Is to abduct ourselves
as newborns.

302
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:22,052
Thus removing ourselves
from our future timelines.

303
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,103
- It's brilliant.
- It's morally questionable.

304
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,098
It's suicidal.

305
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:28,058
If we take too long
in getting them home--

306
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:29,393
Then history is altered.

307
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:32,354
There won't be a <i>home</i>
to go back to.

308
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:34,315
You'll disappear from the minds

309
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:35,941
of everyone
who's ever known you.

310
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:38,944
You mean, my own mom
wouldn't even know me?

311
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:40,738
My wife.

312
00:13:40,905 --> 00:13:45,117
Yeah. And my...
Oh yeah, I don't have anyone.

313
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:49,038
Sure as hell beats dying.

314
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,751
- Hey.
- Hey.

315
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,003
How's Ray?

316
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,089
Fine, um, his younger self
is in the hospital,

317
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:02,092
so, our Ray
is healing rather quickly.

318
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,011
Though, you don't seem
too happy about it.

319
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,889

You know what?
It's a long story.

00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:18,922
- "Michael"?
- That's me. My birth name.

The Time Masters insist on
the adoption of new identities

482
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:23,552
for their protection.

483
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:25,559
How do you know so much
about the Time Masters?

484
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:26,638
I work for them.

My true loyalty
is to my children.

487
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:34,604
Thank you. The Time Masters
fill their ranks with children.

MARY: <i>When Michael arrived
at the refuge,</i>

490
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,253
<i>he had nothing
but the clothes on his back.</i>

491
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:42,070
There's a reason
it's called "the refuge."

492
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:45,115
And a reason that it exists
in a secret location in history.

493

The Time Masters will never
think to look for you here.

Thank you for your assistance.

You're not the first tough case

- Sure, it was.

00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,277
You don't know me.

509
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:24,071
You think I wanted
to kill my family?

510
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:27,657
I think you fell in love
with your dad's lighter fluid.

511
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:31,161
I think you fell in love with
the flames dancing around.

512
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:34,167
But then you realized
you couldn't control them,

513
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:38,001
and you ran,
without waking your family.

514
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:41,338
The only thing
you were concerned about

515
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:43,340
was your own skin.

516
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:48,011
Now, while I'm gone, there
better not be any accidents.

If there is,
I'm gonna come looking for you.

You think you've been selfish?

00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:31,805
- I do, yes.
- What a load of old codswallop.

I've always known that you

were brought to me
for a reason, Michael.

That you were ready

anything by wallowing.

So, for goodness sake,
pull yourself out of it

and get the job done.

I'd see you again, do you?

10-year-old Time Masters.

Please, we share

I know how you're feeling
and I'm sorry.

550
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:29,496
I thought affording you time
with your father

551
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:30,989
would lift your spirits.

552
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:33,033
Yeah. I...

553
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,118
I thought so, too.

I just...

555
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:38,947

every report card,
every touchdown,

563
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,973
in the back of my mind,
I always wondered,

564
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,643
"What would my dad
think about this?"

565

- Hey.

No, wait, wait, please.

568
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:19,037
I didn't mean to be a lurker,

00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:21,289
but I heard you
and Sara talking.

00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:23,291
And I get it.

571
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:24,918
You thought I was dying.

572
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:26,405
You told me
what I needed to hear.

573
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:27,837
And it worked.

The woman I met in 1871

was me.

00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:56,199
And she warned me
that it would end in heartbreak

582
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:58,118
if I ever tried to be
with someone--

583

No, it isn't, really.

586
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:09,796
I mean, if I make you happy,

587
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:11,548
if being with me
makes you happy,

588
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:13,675
then you can be happy.

589
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:17,721
Or you can choose to listen to
some former version of yourself

591
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:24,936
When you decide, let me know.

Gideon, I take it that
the Pilgrim's transmission

610
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:40,303
included a carrier frequency

611

<i>through which
she can be contacted.</i>

617
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:51,699
<i>The lives of your team's

619
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:54,651
And I'm gonna counter
that demand

620
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:55,985
with an offer of my own.

621
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:58,071
I will surrender myself

622
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:00,949

Yes, well,

628

I'm offering you me in the past.

Rip Hunter before he became
a Time Master.

630

Eliminate him,

631

It's no trick.

00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:35,191
Enough people
have died at my expense.

the location.

00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:45,952
You're going to meet
my younger self.

638
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:52,125
- JAX: What is this place?
- RIP: Neutral ground.

639
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:54,335
It's a defunct
Time Masters outpost.

640
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:56,897
I thought we were supposed to be
picking up your younger self.

641
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:59,632
He's being brought
to us, actually.

642
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,262
That little boy
was at the refuge.

643
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:07,056
He's you.

644
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:10,059
You got my message.

645
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:12,896
I don't approve
of what you're planning.

646
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:14,981
Not that
it ever stopped you before.

647
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:17,442
Your younger selves
are all still safe and sound.

648
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:18,735
Thank you.

649
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:22,447
- You're a naughty one.
- That's right.

650
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,745
I think it's probably about time
that you left.

651
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:30,163
Give her hell.

652
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:33,917
Where's my dad?

653
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,544
Onboard my ship,
along with the rest.

654
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:39,005
PILGRIM: All in perfect condition.

655
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:41,424
As long as your captain honors
his end of our bargain.

656
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:42,592
You'd murder a child?

657
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:44,802
I'd murder as many children
as is necessary

658
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:45,970
to accomplish my mission.

659
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:47,781
Do you know what this will do
to the timeline?

660
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:49,182
<i>Killing a Time Master?</i>

661
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:52,268
In case you've forgotten, I am
sanctioned by the Time Masters

662
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:55,271
to do what my former colleague
Chronos, here, failed to do.

663
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:56,981
Enough of that!

664
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:00,985
Let's get down to business.

665
00:31:02,195 --> 00:31:03,655
Where's the rest of your group?

666
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:05,114
They're around.

667
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:09,953
I'll be taking the boy.

668
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,496
Before you do that,

669
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:13,706
we don't believe for a second

670
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:15,959
their loved ones
are on your ship.

671
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:19,629
A show of good faith, then.
A prisoner exchange.

672
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,507
Send the boy,
and I'll send the father.

673
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:24,474
PILGRIM: <i>Once I have the future
Captain Hunter</i>

674
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:27,971
in my possession,
then I'll release the rest.

675
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:33,327
- What the hell's going on?
- You don't need to understand.

676
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:35,311
- (GRUNTS)
- Only walk.

677
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:40,567
You are going to be
absolutely fine. I promise.

678
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:51,160
As soon as my dad's in
the clear, let's light this up.

679
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:53,746
Remember, we wait for Ray's cue.

680
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:03,006
ATOM: I'm in position.

681
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:05,008
YOUNG RIP: You wanted to see me?

682
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:06,801
Have I done
something wrong, miss?

683
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:08,595
Not yet.

684
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:09,762
RIP: Now!

685
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:16,603
Fool me once...

686
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:26,362
(GRUNTS)

687
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:34,787
(LOADING)

688
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:37,665
Now, Kendra!

689
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:28,424
I was willing to proceed
in good faith.

690
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:31,886
Now, you'll watch
those closest to you die.

691
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:33,096
(GRUNTS)

692
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:34,514
(GASPING)

693
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:36,683
Thought you could snuff me out?

694
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:39,102
You don't know me at all, miss.

695
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:41,562
(SCREAMING)

696
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:49,195
(CONTINUES SCREAMING)

697
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:00,415
Hey, are you okay?

698
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:02,208
Not really.

699
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,794
Yeah, let me explain.

700
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:11,676
- You poor boy.
- (GRUNTS)

701
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:13,928
I'll take you. You all right?

702
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,681
That's you?

703
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:18,975
Yeah.

704
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:22,478
I was a cut-purse
from the age of five.

705
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:24,856
I starved more than I ate.

706
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:28,484
I knew what I'd do
if she tried to harm me.

707
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:31,571
Lucky for us
you didn't forget your roots.

708
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:35,324
Believe me, Mr. Snart,
I've tried.

709
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:49,046
MARY: There you are. (CHUCKLES)

710
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:52,175
The Pilgrim
may have been dealt with,

711
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:54,260
but the Omega Protocol
is still in effect.

712
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:56,220
I'll look after your friends,
don't worry.

713
00:34:56,387 --> 00:35:00,016
I know you will, Mom.
You did the same for me.

714
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:03,436
Must be strange for you
to see yourself as you were.

715
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:04,604
Hmm.

716
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:06,856
Do you remember
the first day you were here?

717
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:09,150
Yes, I think I tried
to steal your purse.

718
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:10,902
God, I was a mean
little bastard.

719
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:13,362
- You were tough.
- I was selfish.

720
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:15,198
You were surviving.

721
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:17,408
I was home.

722
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:21,579
Which is why I know
you'll be back.

723
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:34,550
Here to give me another

724
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:36,135
don't-burn-down-the-house
speech?

725
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:37,502
You think by hurting yourself,

726
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:39,931
it's gonna make you feel better
about the fire.

727
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:41,577
You don't know anything
about me, man.

728
00:35:41,724 --> 00:35:43,226
Guess again, kid.

729
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:45,561
- I'm you.
- YOUNG RORY: <i>What?</i>

730
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:47,563
RORY: <i>That's right.</i>

731
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:51,984
You're too young to understand.

732
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:53,653
But understand this.

733
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,947
It wasn't your fault.

734
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:02,411
I let that flame
get out of control.

735
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:04,205
YOUNG RORY: <i>Like you said.</i>

736
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:08,835
I ran out, without waking
anybody, like you said.

737
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:12,088
I was just so afraid.

738
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:14,006
You were just a kid.

739
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:18,469
I spent my whole life
blaming you.

740
00:36:19,262 --> 00:36:20,763
Hating you.

741
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:24,433
For something
you didn't mean to do.

742
00:36:24,976 --> 00:36:26,519
Why are you telling me this?

743
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:31,607
You can't change
the things you did.

744
00:36:31,774 --> 00:36:34,026
But you can change
what you become.

745
00:36:35,945 --> 00:36:37,655
Don't be like me.

746
00:36:37,822 --> 00:36:38,823
Be better.

747
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:45,288
Clarissa, it's me, Martin.

748
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:46,734
I'm sorry, you look so familiar,

749
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:48,040
but I just can't place you.

750
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:49,417
Spaceship.

751
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:52,545
- What next? Martians?
- No.

752
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:56,382
- Actually, amnesia pill.
- Oh, yeah. (SCOFFS)

753
00:36:56,549 --> 00:36:58,843
This will just wipe
your short-term memory.

754
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,303
Of course, it's up to you,

755
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:02,513
but we don't wanna mess
with time too much.

756
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:04,599
Hmmm.

757
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:09,854
I always knew that you'd end up
caring for people.

758
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:12,189
Protecting people.

759
00:37:13,316 --> 00:37:15,818
Well, I learned it from my dad.

760
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:19,822
Proud of you, honey.

761
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:28,289
Is everything all right?

762
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:32,001
My wife doesn't seem
to remember me.

763
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:34,962
Because until we return your
younger selves to the timeline,

764
00:37:35,129 --> 00:37:38,007
you, none of you,
will have ever existed.

765
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:40,718
But we will return you.

766
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:42,136
When we left 2016,

767
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:45,556
I just assumed I would return
to the exact moment I left.

768
00:37:45,723 --> 00:37:47,725
That Clarissa wouldn't even know
I was gone.

769
00:37:47,892 --> 00:37:49,518
So, I didn't say goodbye.

770
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,522
And, now, I fear
I will never have that chance.

771
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:55,858
You will.
Look, I've told you before

772
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:58,736
that I am not going
to risk your marriage

773
00:37:58,903 --> 00:38:00,404
in order to save my wife.

774
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:02,865
I promise you, Martin.

775
00:38:03,032 --> 00:38:04,533
Thank you.

776
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,620
Not even gonna pretend
to understand any of this.

777
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:09,038
(CHUCKLES) Yes. Pretty crazy.
Huh?

778
00:38:09,205 --> 00:38:10,206
(SIGHS)

779
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:12,541
That was you.

780
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:16,253
In the hospital,
on the day you were born.

781
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:19,465
And, earlier, on fire.

782
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:21,676
Amazing.

783
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:23,594
- Where'd you learn those moves?
- (LAUGHS)

784
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:25,179
From my dad.

785
00:38:27,682 --> 00:38:30,559
You know, the day you were born,
in the hospital,

786
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:32,728
I've never been so scared.

787
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:34,438
I mean, even in combat.

788
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:38,567
But now, I know,

789
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:40,569
for you to be
the man I see standing here,

790
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,114
I must do something right.

791
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:45,574
I can't wait to be there
to watch it happen.

792
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:47,118
(EXHALES)

793
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:50,121
Dad, listen.

794
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:52,289
On September 26th,

795
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:54,250
you're gonna be deployed
along the K4 circle.

796
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:57,128
Keep your head on the swivel
for an IED.

797
00:38:57,294 --> 00:38:58,295
You know this because...

798
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:02,633
You're from the future.

799
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,302
Please, promise me
you'll be careful.

800
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:08,472
(SNIFFLES)

801
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:14,603
I'll be back soon, okay?

802
00:39:19,817 --> 00:39:21,569
- Hey.
- KENDRA: <i>Hey.</i>

803
00:39:22,945 --> 00:39:25,239
Hope you don't mind,
my fiancée...

804
00:39:26,657 --> 00:39:28,659
My other fiancée is

805
00:39:28,993 --> 00:39:31,495
- in our quarters, resting.
- Yeah, no, that's...

806
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:32,705
That's fine.

807
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:35,207
- Hey, I'm sorry--
- No, really, it's fine.

808
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:37,293
No, I mean,

809
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,920
being at death's door
is not the right time

810
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:41,881
to pop the question.

811
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:43,507
Look, when you proposed,

812
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:47,219
I was so afraid of losing you.

813
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:48,971
And then facing the Pilgrim,

814
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:54,060
I realized, there is never going
to be a right time for this.

815
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:57,772
So, we should stop waiting
for the right time.

816
00:39:58,814 --> 00:39:59,815
Uh...

817
00:40:00,024 --> 00:40:01,108
I don't understand.

818
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:09,658
I wanna marry you, Ray.

819
00:40:11,786 --> 00:40:13,204
I mean it.

820
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:21,712
How's your sister?

821
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:23,255
She's a tough kid.

822
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:24,548
How's your dad?

823
00:40:24,715 --> 00:40:27,468
Sleeping off that amnesia pill
from Rip.

824
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:30,554
Hey.

825
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:33,825
I might have just stopped my dad

826
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:35,129
from getting killed
at Mogadishu.

827
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,812
I just thought
I should tell you in case

828
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:39,730
there's a time paradox,
or whatever.

829
00:40:39,897 --> 00:40:41,524
Well, as I've been saying,
Mr. Jackson,

830
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,110
- time wants to happen.
- Yeah, I know, but...

831
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:46,237
- I had to try.
- And perhaps,

832
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:48,364
what time wants is to see

833
00:40:48,531 --> 00:40:50,282
you and your father
back together.

834
00:40:52,368 --> 00:40:53,369
(GRUNTS)

835
00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:56,539
Just pulled younger me's head
from out of his ass.

836
00:40:57,081 --> 00:40:59,875
- I'm not sure it stuck.
- Me either.

837
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:01,335
But I saw younger Rip change,

838
00:41:01,502 --> 00:41:03,129
and I thought
why not give it a shot.

839
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:05,214
Surprised you didn't advise
your teenage self

840
00:41:05,381 --> 00:41:06,882
to not get on a certain boat.

841
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:08,592
Yeah, me, too.

842
00:41:08,843 --> 00:41:10,683
(EXCLAIMING) I thought
we were on a clock here.

843
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,263
Indeed, we are. Um...

844
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:16,767
Time, the history from which
your younger selves were removed

845
00:41:17,977 --> 00:41:19,228
is beginning to set.

846
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:25,401
RIP: <i>As is evidenced by
the change in Clarissa's memory.</i>

847
00:41:25,568 --> 00:41:27,688
Okay, so how long do we have
till these changes stick?

848
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:28,779
No one knows.

849
00:41:28,946 --> 00:41:30,382
RIP: <i>Which is why
we need to move swiftly</i>

850
00:41:30,406 --> 00:41:31,448
to locate Vandal Savage

851
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:34,076
if any of your lives
are to be restored to normal.

852
00:41:34,243 --> 00:41:35,244
So how long will it take

853
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:36,638
to determine a new location
for Savage?

854
00:41:36,662 --> 00:41:38,038
Longer than we have.

855
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:40,166
Fortunately,
there is one place in time

856
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:41,834
that we know Savage to be.

857
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:44,211
You said he conquered
the world in 2166.

858
00:41:44,378 --> 00:41:46,064
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>You also said
it was too dangerous</i>

859
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:47,089
to strike at Savage

860
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:48,441
while he was at the height
of his powers.

861
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:49,466
That, it is.

862
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:53,095
But with your younger selves
removed from history,

863
00:41:53,262 --> 00:41:56,515
we have, quite literally,

864
00:41:56,682 --> 00:41:58,684
run out of time.

865
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:28,714
