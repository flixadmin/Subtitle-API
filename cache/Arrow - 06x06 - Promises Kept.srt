I was gonna tell Oliver,

Well, then now that
I have, I need your help.

Is there anything, anything
that Argus is working on

that can help my condition?

I thought it was just
some kind of steroid.

00:21:55,545 --> 00:21:57,478
Yeah, we found out
that the manufacturer

uh...criminal activity.

I don't know. Maybe more.

00:22:06,255 --> 00:22:08,356
Right. So your
experimental steroid is

an illegal drug.

You're still using
the drug.

And I guess that
means

that the drug dealer
is out there, too.

into the explosion.

649
00:36:48,538 --> 00:36:49,804
Johnnie.

650
00:36:49,806 --> 00:36:51,506
I was a hypocrite,
and I'm sorry.

651
00:36:51,508 --> 00:36:53,708
I'm sorry.

652
00:36:55,879 --> 00:37:00,181
Don't be sorry. Be safe.

653
00:37:00,183 --> 00:37:01,849
Are you ok?

654
00:37:01,851 --> 00:37:03,251
I'm trying.

655
00:37:08,091 --> 00:37:11,092
Hey. Come here, you.

656
00:37:12,595 --> 00:37:14,662
Ohh.

657
00:37:14,664 --> 00:37:15,863
I missed you.

658
00:37:15,865 --> 00:37:18,099
I missed you,
Daddy.

659
00:37:25,508 --> 00:37:28,075
I have, uh, one more
stop tonight.

660
00:37:28,077 --> 00:37:30,077
There are some
other people...

661
00:37:31,881 --> 00:37:37,285
Who deserve an apology
and an explanation.

662
00:37:38,555 --> 00:37:40,087
Ok.

663
00:37:46,129 --> 00:37:47,328
William: I'm gonna win.

664
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,263
Felicity: Nope! Oh,
I almost got you.

665
00:37:49,265 --> 00:37:51,599
Come on! Gah!

666
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:53,367
- Yes.
- No!

667
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:54,368
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

668
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:55,670
- Rematch? Rematch.
- All right.

669
00:37:55,672 --> 00:37:57,071
I got you
on this one.

670
00:37:57,073 --> 00:37:59,540
- Hi.
- Hey.

671
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:02,944
Hey, buddy,
come here.

672
00:38:04,581 --> 00:38:06,581
Ok, ah, you
weren't gone that long.

673
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:08,950
I know. I know.
I'm happy to see you.

674
00:38:08,952 --> 00:38:10,551
It's allowed.

675
00:38:10,553 --> 00:38:12,920
So what happened
with your friend?

676
00:38:13,957 --> 00:38:15,623
- He found his son.
- That's good.

677
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:17,425
So what'd I miss?

678
00:38:17,427 --> 00:38:18,659
Well, Raisa made me
clean my room...

679
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:19,894
Good.

680
00:38:19,896 --> 00:38:21,596
Felicity and I ate
ice cream for dinner,

681
00:38:21,598 --> 00:38:23,231
and I got an "A" on
my science project.

682
00:38:23,233 --> 00:38:24,632
- You got an "A"?
- Yeah.

683
00:38:24,634 --> 00:38:26,634
That's fantastic. Is it
here? Can I see it?

684
00:38:26,636 --> 00:38:27,902
Yeah, sure.

685
00:38:27,904 --> 00:38:29,370
It's a bottle rocket.

686
00:38:29,372 --> 00:38:30,871
Went 300 feet, the farthest
in the whole school.

687
00:38:30,873 --> 00:38:32,340
- Unbelievable.
- I'll go get it.

688
00:38:32,342 --> 00:38:33,975
All right.

689
00:38:33,977 --> 00:38:35,977
Pretty cool.

690
00:38:35,979 --> 00:38:38,045
I hope you don't mind
that I'm here.

691
00:38:38,047 --> 00:38:39,780
I mean, William said that he was
kind of getting sick of Raisa.

692
00:38:39,782 --> 00:38:41,249
And the ice cream
for dinner?

693
00:38:41,251 --> 00:38:42,717
It was Rocky Road,
so, technically,

694
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:44,285
the nuts should count
as protein and--

695
00:38:44,287 --> 00:38:45,853
I'm so happy
you're here.

696
00:38:45,855 --> 00:38:47,021
Me, too.

697
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:51,292
Slade got his
happy ending?

698
00:38:51,294 --> 00:38:53,394
Not...Like that.
Ha ha.

699
00:38:53,396 --> 00:38:56,330
It's a long story.
It's a...

700
00:38:56,332 --> 00:38:57,865
It's a sad
story.

701
00:38:57,867 --> 00:38:59,567
I'm sensing a "but."

702
00:38:59,569 --> 00:39:01,636
- I learned something.
- Hmm?

703
00:39:01,638 --> 00:39:03,104
I made the right
decision

704
00:39:03,106 --> 00:39:05,306
to not
be the Green Arrow

705
00:39:05,308 --> 00:39:07,642
for William
and for me.

706
00:39:07,644 --> 00:39:08,776
Good.

707
00:39:08,778 --> 00:39:11,312
William: If we can
go up to the roof,

708
00:39:11,314 --> 00:39:13,614
I can show you
how it works.

709
00:39:13,616 --> 00:39:15,182
- Yeah. Yes.
- Yes!

710
00:39:15,184 --> 00:39:17,151
[Cell phone ringing
and vibrating]

711
00:39:24,994 --> 00:39:26,827
Felicity: Let's go.

712
00:39:30,033 --> 00:39:31,632
The moment I hesitated,

713
00:39:31,634 --> 00:39:34,035
even as the flames
grew closer...

714
00:39:34,037 --> 00:39:35,803
[Heavy sigh]

715
00:39:35,805 --> 00:39:38,339
That was
my rock bottom.

716
00:39:38,341 --> 00:39:40,474
I should've told you
all about the tremor

717
00:39:40,476 --> 00:39:42,009
from the beginning.

718
00:39:42,011 --> 00:39:43,811
I'm truly sorry
I didn't.

719
00:39:43,813 --> 00:39:46,213
Rene: So you're saying
the tremor started

720
00:39:46,215 --> 00:39:49,517
before Black Siren showed
her face in Star City?

721
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:51,886
Yes.

722
00:39:51,888 --> 00:39:54,021
And that's why,
Rene, I owe you

723
00:39:54,023 --> 00:39:55,990
the biggest apology
of all.

724
00:39:55,992 --> 00:39:57,358
You should've known
what was going on

725
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,460
before we ever got
to that bridge, man.

726
00:39:59,462 --> 00:40:01,395
My pride almost got
you killed.

727
00:40:01,397 --> 00:40:03,964
I betrayed your
trust,

728
00:40:03,966 --> 00:40:05,533
put your lives
in danger.

729
00:40:05,535 --> 00:40:07,034
All I can ask is
that you forgive me,

730
00:40:07,036 --> 00:40:08,736
but I understand
if you can't.

731
00:40:08,738 --> 00:40:11,205
Well, getting shot
wasn't great,

732
00:40:11,207 --> 00:40:13,641
but if I'm counting the
times you've saved my life

733
00:40:13,643 --> 00:40:15,876
against the times you
almost got me killed,

734
00:40:15,878 --> 00:40:17,678
you're still ahead.

735
00:40:19,215 --> 00:40:21,916
I, for one, am
incredibly offended...

736
00:40:21,918 --> 00:40:23,551
And you have every
right to be, Curtis.

737
00:40:23,553 --> 00:40:24,785
That you didn't come
to me first

738
00:40:24,787 --> 00:40:26,087
for help treating you.

739
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:27,254
I mean, I--I created
a chip to help

740
00:40:27,256 --> 00:40:28,956
a woman walk, people.

741
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:30,157
He's got a point, John.

742
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:31,459
It might be time
to outsource

743
00:40:31,461 --> 00:40:33,527
this little problem.

744
00:40:33,529 --> 00:40:36,063
Yeah. Yeah.

745
00:40:36,065 --> 00:40:37,565
Outstanding.

746
00:40:37,567 --> 00:40:39,567
So have you already had
an electromyogram? Wait.

747
00:40:39,569 --> 00:40:41,702
What am I talking about?
We need to start off with an NCV test first.

748
00:40:41,704 --> 00:40:44,739
Curtis, it's been
a long night.

749
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:47,575
Is there any way
we can do this in the morning?

750
00:40:47,577 --> 00:40:51,078
Sure thing.
It would be my honor.

751
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,913
It would be
my pleasure.

752
00:40:52,915 --> 00:40:54,515
[Fake coughs]
Kiss ass.

753
00:40:54,517 --> 00:40:56,317
What the--
I'm trying to...

754
00:41:03,493 --> 00:41:04,892
You waiting on
a special apology?

755
00:41:04,894 --> 00:41:06,527
Because you deserve one.

756
00:41:06,529 --> 00:41:10,197
No. I'm just waiting
to make sure you're ok.

757
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:11,966
- Really?
- Really.

758
00:41:11,968 --> 00:41:13,534
Well, I'm gonna
give you one anyway.

759
00:41:13,536 --> 00:41:15,903
Dinah, I lied to
you, and I'm sorry,

760
00:41:15,905 --> 00:41:18,105
but I'll make you
one more promise--

761
00:41:18,107 --> 00:41:20,941
there'll be no more secrets
between you and me.

762
00:41:20,943 --> 00:41:22,977
No more secrets.
