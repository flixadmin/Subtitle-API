We are gathered here today
to immortalize in song

7
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:20,787
the life and untimely death
of a great legend.

8
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:23,040
Rango...
So sit back, relax,

9
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:27,044
and enjoy your low-calorie popcorn
and assorted confections,

10
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:32,341
while we tell you the strange
and bewildering tale of a hero

11
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,886
who has yet to enter his own story.

12
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:53,321
Crunchy, creamy, cookie, candy, cupcake.

13
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,074
Okay, everybody, let's
take it from the top.

14
00:01:58,242 --> 00:01:59,034
The stage is set,

15
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:01,578
the night moist with apprehension.

16
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:02,746
Alone in her chamber,

17
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,083
the princess prepares
to take her own life.

18
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,252
"It is far better to nourish worms

19
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,045
"than to live without love."

20
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:12,422
She reaches for the poisoned chalice.

21
00:02:12,506 --> 00:02:13,799
Meanwhile, the wicked Malvolio

22
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,968
plots his ascension to the throne

23
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,637
While her aging father lies gravely ill.

24
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,140
"Yes, I am gravely ill."

25
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:24,393
"Hark, who goes there?"

26
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,728
'Tis I, the much-anticipated hero,

27
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:29,690
returning to rescue his emotionally
unstable maiden!

28
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,733
Unhand her, you jailers of virtue,

29
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:34,987
or taste the bitter sting
of my vengeance!

30
00:02:35,863 --> 00:02:37,948
The sting of my...

31
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,702
Dr. Marx?

32
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,936
Dr. Marx, I'm not getting
anything from you.

33
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,540
People, we've talked about this.

34
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,208
Acting is reacting.

35
00:02:48,292 --> 00:02:50,669
Victor, you were wooden!
There, I said it.

36
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,047
Mr. Timms?
You were good.

37
00:02:54,423 --> 00:02:56,508
Perhaps a little too good.

38
00:02:56,592 --> 00:02:57,718
What's that, Victor?

39
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,679
My character's undefined?
That's absurd.

40
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,931
I know who I am.
I'm the...

41
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:05,434
I'm the guy, the protagonist, the hero.

42
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,810
Every story needs a hero.

43
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:08,979
I mean, who else is better qualified

44
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:13,067
to bask in the adulation of
his numerous companions?

45
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:34,171
<i>The stage is waiting.</i>

46
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:36,841
<i>The audience thirsts for adventure.</i>

47
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,803
<i>Who am I?</i>

48
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,347
<i>I could be anyone.</i>

49
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,058
I... I could be the sea cap'n

50
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,685
returning from a mighty voyage

51
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:50,354
to reclaim his mechanical arm!

52
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,189
Ow! Ow!

53
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,441
Or I could be the rogue anthropologist,

54
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,860
battling pythons down in the Congo!

55
00:03:56,944 --> 00:03:58,904
Down, Chongo, down!

56
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,449
And if you desire romance...

57
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:04,326
I will become the greatest lover

58
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,870
the world has ever known!

59
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,089
I couldn't help but notice you
noticing me noticing you.

60
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,926
You know, the womens find me
uncomfortably good looking.

61
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,762
But you seem remarkably at ease.

62
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,514
Oh, stop it.
No, really.

63
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,390
Well, if you must.

64
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,141
What are you doing?

65
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:30,394
That tickles.
Are those real?

66
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:33,730
That's it!
Conflict.

67
00:04:33,814 --> 00:04:34,815
Victor, you were right.

68
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,358
I have been undefined.

69
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,902
People, I've had an epiphany.

70
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:41,530
The hero cannot exist in a vacuum!

71
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,783
What our story needs is an
ironic, unexpected event

72
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,867
that will propel the hero into conflict!

73
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:45,344
Mr. Timms?

74
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,225
Ooh...

75
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:21,255
<i>Oye!</i>

76
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:28,679
That's right! You!

77
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,308
Don't be shy.
Come on.

78
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:34,184
It's okay.

79
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,061
That's it, a little closer.

80
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,189
Good.

81
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:41,108
I won't bite you.

82
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,487
I need a little help here.

83
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,906
Uh, are you okay?

84
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,700
I must get to the other side.

85
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:51,868
The other side?
You mean, just now,

86
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:53,245
that was you crossing the road?

87
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,872
That's why the...

88
00:06:55,956 --> 00:06:56,998
Why'd you do that?

89
00:06:57,082 --> 00:07:00,418
This is my quest.
He waits for me.

90
00:07:00,502 --> 00:07:02,003
What? Who?

91
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:04,381
The Spirit of the West, <i>amigo.</i>

92
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:05,757
The one.

93
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:07,843
They say he rides an alabaster carriage

94
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,928
with golden guardians to protect him.

95
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,888
What are you talking about?

96
00:07:11,972 --> 00:07:15,600
Enlightenment.
We are nothing without it.

97
00:07:15,684 --> 00:07:16,768
Nothing?

98
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:19,062
Your delusional quest
just ruined my life!

99
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:21,565
I had an incredibly complex
social network going!

100
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,816
Highly sophisticated friends!

101
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,568
I was very popular!

102
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,820
Friends? I don't see no friends.

103
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,992
You are a very lonely lizard.

104
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:36,621
Now help me up and I will help
you find what you seek.

105
00:07:36,705 --> 00:07:37,747
You will?

106
00:07:37,831 --> 00:07:39,749
Quickly. I must get back to my quest.

107
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,418
You mean you've done this before?

108
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,086
Oh, yes. Many times.

109
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:47,090
Yeah. Come, come.
That's it, pull my finger.

110
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:49,176
The Spirit is waiting for me.

111
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:50,594
Okay, okay.

112
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,768
Okay. That's not going to work.

113
00:07:58,852 --> 00:08:00,645
I must get to the other side.

114
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:04,566
Why don't you just wait until
there are no cars coming?

115
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,401
It's not so easy as it looks.

116
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:07,527
What?

117
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:09,071
Is a metaphor.

118
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,394
Whoa!
There's another one!

119
00:08:42,062 --> 00:08:43,731
I knew it.

120
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,826
You need a little help, <i>amigo?</i>

121
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,704
I think the metaphor broke my spleen.

122
00:08:59,788 --> 00:09:02,332
The path to knowledge is
fraught with consequence.

123
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,669
Yeah, I'm just looking
for the path to water.

124
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,796
If you want to find water,

125
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,340
you must first find Dirt.

126
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,967
Uh, Dirt.

127
00:09:13,385 --> 00:09:15,887
Destiny, she is kind to you.

128
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:19,724
Tomorrow is Wednesday.
The water comes.

129
00:09:19,808 --> 00:09:21,810
At noon, the townspeople gather

130
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,603
for a mysterious ritual.

131
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:25,188
Oh! A... a... a town?

132
00:09:25,272 --> 00:09:28,358
You mean, like, with real people
and everything? Where?

133
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,361
A day's journey.
Follow your shadow.

134
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:36,157
You want me to just walk
out into the desert?

135
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:37,742
Mm-hmm.
That's the way.

136
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:40,286
Okay.
So you're saying

137
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,873
there's a town, a real town,
not a metaphor town.

138
00:09:43,957 --> 00:09:45,626
Go on. It's okay.

139
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:47,836
Okay.

140
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,879
Well, then, I'm going.

141
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:52,466
I am leaving the road now!

142
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:56,428
I'm walking into the desert!

143
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,054
Alone!

144
00:09:58,138 --> 00:10:00,474
We all have our journeys to make!

145
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:04,228
I will see you on the other side.

00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:07,624
animals have had millions of years

159
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,668
to adapt to the harsh environment.

160
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:14,589
But the lizard?
He is going to die.

161
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:17,926
"Four score and seven years
ago, our fathers..."

162
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,220
Don't move.
What?

163
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:27,477
Don't move!
Not moving.

164
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,187
Not moving.

165
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,231
Try to blend in.
Huh?

166
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,233
Blend in?
What do you mean?

167
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:37,987
Blend in.

168
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:39,281
What are you saying?

169
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,617
Too late.
No, no.

170
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:43,159
It's not too late!

171
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:45,620
I'm blending!
I'm a blender!

172
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,706
Hey, calm down!
What are you doing?

173
00:11:51,084 --> 00:11:52,336
Stop moving!

174
00:11:53,086 --> 00:11:54,630
Try not to look conspicuous.

175
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:04,639
Hey, psst.
What are you doing?

176
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:05,598
I'm blending.

177
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:07,433
Go blend somewhere else.
Don't distract me.

178
00:12:07,517 --> 00:12:09,394
No room at the inn.
It's an art, not a science.

179
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,146
Find your own hiding place.
No, this is good.

180
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,148
Here she comes!

181
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,190
You better run, Mojito!

182
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:15,859
What?
I thought you said, "Don't move."

183
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,362
That was before.
Now, you run.

184
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,911
Oh, hey. Proboscis.

185
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,037
Oh, testy.

186
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,500
Ow!

187
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,427
Please, no, please.
I have vertigo!

188
00:13:24,511 --> 00:13:26,013
My glands are swelling!

189
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:28,849
Please, no.

190
00:13:37,357 --> 00:13:40,777
You! I'll kill you!
You stupid lizard!

191
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,279
Get out of there.
I'm going to strangle your <i>huevos!</i>

192
00:13:43,363 --> 00:13:45,281
Big bird!
Big bird!

193
00:13:45,365 --> 00:13:48,034
No, wait! Come back!
I was just kidding!

194
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,994
Come on, we're friends, right?
I don't know you!

195
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:52,247
Lizards, frogs...
Find your own hiding place!

196
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,539
We're practically related!
No room at the inn!

197
00:13:53,623 --> 00:13:55,250
Come on, move over!
You're not my friend!

198
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,502
I'll let you kiss my sister!

199
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:07,971
You son of a...

200
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:05,612
Where are your friends now, <i>amigo?</i>

201
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,935
Get your slimy-webbed
phalanges off my boots!

202
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:39,645
Oh, uh, sorry.

203
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:42,899
I got a bead on you, stranger.
So you get up real slow

204
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,609
lessen you want to spend the
better part of the afternoon

205
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,486
putting your face back together!

206
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,987
No, ma'am, I don't.

207
00:15:48,071 --> 00:15:49,405
Who are you?

208
00:15:49,489 --> 00:15:51,616
Who am I?
I'm asking the questions here!

209
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,951
Our town is drying up.
We're in the middle of a drought.

210
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:55,912
Now someone's dumping water
in the desert!

211
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,039
It's a puzzle of undeterminable
size and dimension,

212
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,167
but I intend to find out what
role you playing in all this.

213
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,295
Role?
What are you involved in?

214
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:06,297
Oh, well, I'm glad you asked.

215
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:09,425
I've got two one-acts, a mystery
and a musical I've been gestating.

216
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:13,109
I got the words, I'm just working on
the melody right now. It's like a...

217
00:16:15,223 --> 00:16:16,557
I think it's gonna be a western.

218
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:18,935
♪ <i>A monkey got a cracker
His mother was a slapper</i>

219
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,522
♪ <i>She'll be coming 'Round
the mountain In the rain</i> ♪

220
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,818
You ain't from around here, are you?

221
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,155
I'm... I'm still working on it.

222
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:31,697
Uh...

223
00:16:31,781 --> 00:16:33,658
So, what's your name?

224
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,743
Beans.
That's a funny kind of name.

225
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:38,788
What can I say? My daddy
plumb loved baked beans.

226
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,915
Well, you're lucky he didn't
plumb love asparagus.

227
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:41,958
What are you saying?

228
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,918
I mean, I enjoy a hearty
puttanesca myself,

229
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:46,629
but I'm not sure that a child
would appreciate the moniker.

230
00:16:46,713 --> 00:16:48,131
My daddy was a great man,

231
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,591
even if he did exhibit a
proclivity for legumes.

232
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:53,678
Spicy.
You are eating his ashes!

233
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,222
You carry his remains?

234
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,641
No, his ashes.
He loved to smoke.

235
00:16:58,725 --> 00:16:59,809
They never found the body.

236
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,019
Oh, well, I'm sure he had his reasons.

237
00:17:02,103 --> 00:17:03,980
What are you implying?
Nothing. I... I...

238
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,815
My daddy was never near that mine shaft.

239
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,650
He'd been sober for over a month!

240
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:10,736
And for you to insinuate that he would
abandon his parental responsibilities

241
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,697
at a delicate time in
my personal development

242
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,616
is an affront to my sense...

243
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:19,913
Miss Beans?

244
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:22,791
Miss Beans? Hello?

245
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,086
Hello?

246
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,145
And until the people of Andromeda Five

247
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,691
return him safe and sound,
I will not sell my ranch!

248
00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:49,692
What...
What?

249
00:17:49,776 --> 00:17:51,360
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

250
00:17:51,444 --> 00:17:53,237
What am I doing?
You're cuddling me.

251
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:54,530
You were frozen.
No, I wasn't.

252
00:17:54,614 --> 00:17:56,699
Yes, you were.
You stopped talking.

253
00:17:56,783 --> 00:17:58,701
It's...
It's a defense mechanism.

254
00:17:58,785 --> 00:18:00,286
Actually, lots of lizards have it.

255
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,470
You're making that up.

256
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,456
So, you gonna die out here,

257
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,624
or you want a ride into town?

258
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,833
No, no, no. Yeah.

259
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:08,336
No. Yes, please.
Thank you. Sorry.

260
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,090
Today's Wednesday.
Wednesday's when we all get to it.

261
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,550
So who are you, really?

262
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:16,219
Well, I'm a man of many epithets.

263
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,888
There's my stage name,
my pen name, my <i>avatar.</i>

264
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,599
I had a pseudonym once, but
I had it legally changed.

265
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:25,394
And so the stranger,
seeking companionship,

266
00:18:25,478 --> 00:18:30,358
finds the woman, much like
the sirens of ancient times

267
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:35,071
luring him to his certain demise.

268
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,614
...nom de plume, I have a CB handle.

269
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,616
I'm actually one of the few
men with a maiden name.

270
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,994
Whoa!
Well, here we are.

271
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,662
Hmm?

272
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,126
Oh. Oh...

273
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,919
Right.

274
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,171
Well, I sure do appreciate
this, Miss Beans,

275
00:18:52,255 --> 00:18:53,422
and if there's ever anything that I...

276
00:18:53,506 --> 00:18:54,883
Get on up!

277
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,218
Okay, then!

278
00:18:58,136 --> 00:19:00,055
See you, Beans.

279
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:17,780
You heading out, Jim?

280
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:20,866
Well, we gave it our best shot.
We had to sell out.

281
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,703
Can't grow no crops without no water.

282
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,873
Bye, now!

283
00:19:30,543 --> 00:19:31,544
Ow!

284
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,254
What is it?

285
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,175
What was that for?

286
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:39,677
You're funny looking.

287
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,305
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're funny looking, too.

288
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,472
That's a funny-looking shirt.

289
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:45,641
That's a funny-looking dress.
You got funny-looking eyes!

290
00:19:45,725 --> 00:19:47,175
You got a funny-looking face!

291
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,687
You're a stranger.

292
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,481
Strangers don't last long here.

293
00:19:52,565 --> 00:19:54,734
Here's your beans, Beans.

294
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,819
I'm gonna need some more
feed, too, Willie.

295
00:19:56,903 --> 00:19:59,405
Now, Beans, you owe me
three quarts already.

296
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,823
I can't give you no more credit.

297
00:20:00,907 --> 00:20:03,326
But I'll have what I owe you at noon.

298
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,619
You don't understand.

299
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,787
It's Mr. Merrimack down at the bank.

300
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:08,664
He cut off all credit.

301
00:20:08,748 --> 00:20:11,667
Hey, Beans!
Beans!

302
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:13,336
You know that there fella?

303
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,921
Hey, Beans!
Miss Beans!

304
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,631
Nope.

305
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,341
Hey, Beans!

306
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,426
Hey.

307
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:24,013
Right. Blend in.
Yeah, blend in.

308
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,232
I'd like a glass of water.

309
00:21:59,692 --> 00:22:01,569
He wants a glass of water!

310
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,946
Make it a double!

311
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,406
Give him the spittoon!

312
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,080
Cactus juice.
That's what we got.

313
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,314
Hey, there, fruit cup.

314
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:41,484
You're a long ways from home, ain't ya?

315
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,071
Who exactly are you?

316
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,577
<i>Who am I?</i>

317
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,454
<i>I could be anyone.</i>

318
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,793
What's the matter?

319
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,963
You missing your mommy's mangos?

320
00:23:02,755 --> 00:23:05,341
As a matter of fact, I am.

321
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,677
But not as much as your daddy's cooking!

322
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,390
Exactly where did you say you were from?

323
00:23:13,474 --> 00:23:16,519
Me?
I'm from the West.

324
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:20,231
Out there, beyond the horizon.
Past the sunset.

325
00:23:20,773 --> 00:23:22,650
The Far West.

326
00:23:24,777 --> 00:23:26,195
Yeah, that's right, <i>hombres.</i>

327
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,198
The place I come from, we
kill a man before breakfast

328
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,826
just to work up an appetite.

329
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,828
Then we salt him, and we pepper him.

330
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:38,582
Then we braise him in clarified butter.
And then we eat him.

331
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:40,334
You eat him?
That's what I said!

332
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:41,710
Hell, I seen things

333
00:23:41,794 --> 00:23:44,713
make a grown man lose control
of his glandular functions!

334
00:23:44,797 --> 00:23:46,549
You spend three days in a horse carcass,

335
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,883
living off your own juices.

336
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:50,970
It'll change a man.
Oh, yeah.

337
00:23:53,389 --> 00:23:56,433
Had a few extra aces in this deck, gents.

338
00:23:56,517 --> 00:23:58,227
Just the way I like it.

339
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,896
So, no, my hirsute little rodent friend,

340
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,898
I am not from around these parts.

341
00:24:02,982 --> 00:24:05,276
You might say I'm from everywhere
there's trouble brewing

342
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,570
and hell waiting to be raised.

343
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:11,199
You might say I'm what hell's
already raised up.

344
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,160
Name's...

345
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,204
Rango.

346
00:24:17,997 --> 00:24:20,082
Rango.

347
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:23,252
Hey, are you the fella that
killed them Jenkins brothers?

348
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:26,130
Uh-huh. Killed them with one bullet.

349
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,174
Don't get no deader.

350
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,343
All seven of them?

351
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:32,761
That's right.

352
00:24:32,845 --> 00:24:35,223
All seven of them.

353
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:39,602
Exactly how you do that, Mr. Rango?

354
00:24:42,188 --> 00:24:43,939
You know, I'm glad you asked me that.

355
00:24:44,023 --> 00:24:46,275
And I will be happy to tell you how.

356
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,309
But you're all gonna have to listen up!

357
00:24:49,195 --> 00:24:51,197
Because this is where it gets...

358
00:24:52,448 --> 00:24:53,533
complicated.

359
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,745
That'll close out your
account, Mrs. Oats,

360
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,996
two gulps and a swig.

361
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,331
Hands off, Mordecai!

362
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,615
That's what's left of
your college education!

363
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,712
I don't rightly have no
other choice, Beans.

364
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:11,550
Times being so hard, we just
can't give no more credit.

365
00:25:11,634 --> 00:25:14,554
But this here is a bank.
This is where you keep the water.

366
00:25:17,598 --> 00:25:20,184
Beans, you've been like a niece to me

367
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,728
ever since your daddy...

368
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:26,649
did not fall drunk down a mine shaft.

369
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:31,820
And I've tried to protect you and
others from certain realities.

370
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,323
But that... Well...

371
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,325
Mr. Merrimack?
Realities are bearing down.

372
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,618
Mr. Merrimack!

373
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,329
Are you all right?

374
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:43,708
Beans, I need to show you something.

375
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:53,175
That's all that's left?

376
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:55,135
And this here is the reserve!

377
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:56,845
Now, I don't know if you've noticed,

378
00:25:56,929 --> 00:25:58,889
but folks just ain't making deposits

379
00:25:58,973 --> 00:26:00,516
on a Wednesday no more!

380
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,602
Mr. Merrimack, if I don't get some
water, I'm gonna lose my ranch

381
00:26:03,686 --> 00:26:06,355
and you're telling me that's all
that's left in the whole town?

382
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:09,858
Now that just don't make
no sense. Now, listen.

383
00:26:09,942 --> 00:26:14,405
Someone is dumping water in the desert.

384
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:17,033
I seen it with my own eyes.

385
00:26:19,118 --> 00:26:20,995
Water in the desert?

386
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,998
<i>Was</i> this during one of
your special times?

387
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,541
No.

388
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,126
Well, we can all dream,

389
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,420
but this is the reality.

390
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,964
Why do you think so many
people are selling out?

391
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,382
They just can't make it.

392
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:36,176
Well, what am I supposed to do?

393
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,762
Well, I suppose we could
talk to the Mayor.

394
00:26:38,846 --> 00:26:42,349
I hear he's been helping people
out in this time of crisis.

395
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:43,392
The Mayor?

396
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:46,353
He may be our only hope.

397
00:26:46,437 --> 00:26:49,023
Bullet hits a shovel, ricochets
back towards number three,

398
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,441
and that's when the roof caved in,

399
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,860
igniting the thermos
of pure grain alcohol

400
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,070
instantly vaporizing his bodily form,

401
00:26:55,154 --> 00:26:56,864
leaving nothing but a charcoal statue

402
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,741
and a high-pitched squeal.

403
00:27:03,454 --> 00:27:04,747
Oh!

404
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,290
Hold on, there.

405
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,835
That's only six.
What happened to number seven?

406
00:27:10,002 --> 00:27:11,503
Number seven?

407
00:27:11,587 --> 00:27:13,840
Hell, he died of infection.

408
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,053
Seven men!
One bullet!

409
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,847
Drinks all around!

410
00:27:23,891 --> 00:27:26,143
Dance for me, Sod Buster!

411
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:28,896
Yes, dance like a chicken!
That's right! Dance!

412
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,441
You got corn in your ears, mate?

413
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:35,569
You don't pay the mortgage,
you don't own the land!

414
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,780
That's basic real estate law, my friend.

415
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:38,989
Quid pro quo!

416
00:27:39,073 --> 00:27:42,034
If I see your face in this town again,

417
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,952
I'm gonna slice it off

418
00:27:44,036 --> 00:27:46,539
and use it to wipe my unmentionables.

419
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,374
Mind the beak.

420
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,794
And don't come back!

421
00:27:54,046 --> 00:27:56,632
What are you all gawping at?

422
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,597
Hey, Bad Bill, there's something
I got to tell you!

423
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,436
Oy. What is this?

424
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,688
You know who that is, Bill?

425
00:28:11,772 --> 00:28:13,315
That there's Rango!

426
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:15,901
Yeah, yeah, he ain't afraid of you!

427
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,820
He ain't afraid of none of you.

428
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,321
Killed them Jenkins brothers.

429
00:28:19,405 --> 00:28:20,989
Done it with one bullet, Bill.

430
00:28:21,073 --> 00:28:22,366
All seven of them!

431
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,410
Is that right?

432
00:29:02,531 --> 00:29:04,784
Oh, let me get that before you...

433
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,290
No. Oh, I know. Here.

434
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:12,959
Oh!

435
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,171
Just take care of that for you.

436
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,299
There. All better.

437
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,739
Whoa! Whoa.

438
00:29:44,907 --> 00:29:46,659
T.O. T.O.
Just a second.

439
00:29:49,912 --> 00:29:51,079
All right, now listen!

440
00:29:51,163 --> 00:29:54,000
I'm gonna give you fellas one
last chance to reconsider!

441
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:02,174
And if you don't want to reconsider,

442
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:05,386
I might consider reconsidering myself.

443
00:30:13,185 --> 00:30:14,395
Huh?

444
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:20,317
Now that's what I'm talking about.
Yeah.

445
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,027
All right, now listen up!

446
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,905
Things are going to be different around
here now that Rango's in town.

447
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:28,033
Got some new rules!
I want my shoes shined every morning,

448
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,826
my coffee hot, Danish on the side.

449
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:32,371
Whatever you do, don't
look me in the eye.

450
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:35,082
Stay out of my peripheral vision!

451
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,042
It's Rango.
What's he up to?

452
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,335
He ain't afraid of nobody.

453
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,462
He's telling that bird what's for!

454
00:30:40,546 --> 00:30:42,464
And when you see me coming, stand aside.

455
00:30:42,548 --> 00:30:45,425
I take large steps and I don't
want none of you hayseeds

456
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:47,511
getting your bodily fluids on my boots!

457
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,766
Of course, there is no need for violence,

458
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:56,019
as long as we stick together,
work as a team.

459
00:30:56,103 --> 00:30:57,271
So I want you all

460
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,314
to come on outside now
and line up single file

461
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:01,098
while I take a brief intermission!

462
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,195
What's he doing now?

463
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,156
I... I think it's a number two.

464
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,888
Never... never mind.

465
00:31:51,617 --> 00:31:53,368
Take a look-see over here!

466
00:31:53,452 --> 00:31:54,703
Well, look at him now!

467
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,580
He's chasing after that hawk!

468
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,457
Give him hell, Rango!

469
00:32:45,337 --> 00:32:46,672
Oh, no!

470
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,362
Did you see that?

471
00:33:52,446 --> 00:33:53,822
He killed that thing!

472
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,241
What do you...
what do you think, Doc?

473
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:59,661
This hawk is dead!

474
00:33:59,745 --> 00:34:02,289
Shoot, I say we cook that right up.

475
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,124
He did it with one bullet!

476
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,417
Just like he said!

477
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,377
It's about time we had
a hero around here.

478
00:34:07,461 --> 00:34:09,588
One who ain't in a pine box.

479
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,008
I think it's time he met the Mayor.

480
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:16,344
You hear that, Rango?
You're going to meet the Mayor!

481
00:34:16,428 --> 00:34:18,347
Let's hear it for Rango!

482
00:34:22,142 --> 00:34:24,352
And so the stranger basks

483
00:34:24,436 --> 00:34:27,814
in the adulation of his new friends,

484
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:33,361
sinking deeper into the guacamole
of his own deception.

485
00:34:33,445 --> 00:34:34,863
When is he going to die?

486
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:37,199
Soon, <i>compadre.</i>
Soon.

487
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,926
My land is not for sale!

488
00:34:57,469 --> 00:34:59,679
I came here to save my land, not sell it!

489
00:34:59,763 --> 00:35:00,931
I'm sure there's something reasonable

490
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,225
we can work out if you just talk to him!

491
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,312
Beans! Where are you going? Beans?

492
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,064
The Mayor will see you now.

493
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,073
Water, Mr. Rango, water.

494
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:21,743
Without it, there's nothing
but dust and decay.

495
00:35:21,827 --> 00:35:25,998
But with water...
there's life.

496
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:32,796
Look at them, so desperate to live,
they'll follow it anywhere.

497
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:36,008
That's the immutable law of the desert.

498
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,388
Control the water and
you control everything.

499
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,099
This is from my private stock.

500
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:48,311
Vintage rainwater from the Great Deluge.

501
00:35:48,395 --> 00:35:52,191
Not Noah's deluge.
Good heavens, I'm not that old.

502
00:35:54,693 --> 00:35:57,696
I guess power has its privileges.

503
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,073
You make a good point, son.

504
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:03,160
But with privilege comes responsibility.

505
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,869
Uh...

506
00:36:04,953 --> 00:36:07,956
Hell, I was mayor here
before there was a Dirt!

507
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,209
And I may be just a sentimental
old turtle

508
00:36:11,293 --> 00:36:14,421
but I think there's a
future for this town.

509
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,105
And I hope you'll be part of it.

510
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,718
To Dirt!

511
00:36:20,135 --> 00:36:21,178
To Dirt.

512
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,724
You see them, Mr. Rango?

513
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,810
All my friends and neighbors?

514
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:32,731
It's a hard life here.
Very hard.

515
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:35,565
Do you know how they make it
through each and every day?

516
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,403
They believe.

517
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:41,156
They believe it's going to be better.

518
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,576
They believe that the water will come.

519
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,162
They believe against all
odds and all evidence

520
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,748
that tomorrow will be better than today.

521
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,211
People have to believe in something.

522
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,424
Right now, they believe in you.

523
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:04,930
Pick it up, Mr. Rango.
Your destiny awaits.

524
00:37:08,016 --> 00:37:10,936
People have to believe in something.

525
00:37:16,608 --> 00:37:18,318
It just don't make no sense.

526
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,527
This whole town is drying up,

527
00:37:19,611 --> 00:37:22,030
and the Mayor is the only one
who don't seem to be affected.

528
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,157
Doesn't that make you just
a wee bit suspicious?

529
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:26,159
And what about that water
I saw out in the desert?

530
00:37:26,243 --> 00:37:27,160
Is that...

531
00:37:27,244 --> 00:37:30,580
All right! All right!
No need to incite anxiety.

532
00:37:30,664 --> 00:37:32,082
I'll inquire about the Mayor.

533
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:35,960
But if you really feel there's
some conspiracy occurring,

534
00:37:36,044 --> 00:37:38,463
I suggest you take it up
with the new sheriff.

535
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,756
Mmm-hmm.

536
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,549
This is going to be good. Hey!

537
00:37:41,633 --> 00:37:43,301
Watch that needle there.

538
00:37:43,385 --> 00:37:45,637
Not too tight.
I want to leave room for some pucker!

539
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,972
That's good.
Oh, easy there, tiger.

540
00:37:48,056 --> 00:37:49,849
A little up and back?
I don't think...

541
00:37:49,933 --> 00:37:51,059
Have you got French cuffs with that?

542
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,519
Excuse me, Sheriff Rango.
I want to talk to you.

543
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,229
Hey, Beans, what do you
think of the new duds?

544
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,272
I got a 10-gallon hat
marked down from 15.

545
00:37:56,356 --> 00:37:57,899
That's nice.
Have you met Angelique?

546
00:37:57,983 --> 00:38:00,151
Hello, Beans.
Hello, Angelique.

547
00:38:00,235 --> 00:38:01,069
Tart.
Floozy.

548
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,238
Trollop.
Excuse me, Mr. Rango.

549
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,448
I will blow that ugly
right off your face!

550
00:38:05,532 --> 00:38:07,200
I was just thinking that, uh...

551
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:09,244
Oh, you want the old
John Hancock, do you?

552
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,286
Well, here. Hold this.

553
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,080
Sheriff Rango, this isn't a social call.

554
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,331
There's a bullet in there.

555
00:38:13,415 --> 00:38:15,500
Oh, I know about the shindig
this afternoon.

556
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,961
I ordered myself some right fancy duds.
Sheriff, I'd like to file a...

557
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,129
Mr. Rango!
Oh, you, too?

558
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:19,754
No problem.

559
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:21,756
Here, let me just...
I need you to investigate...

560
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,341
You know, Beans, I bet
you clean up real nice,

561
00:38:23,425 --> 00:38:24,968
you put a little effort into it.
What?

562
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,053
Now, remember, son, stay in
school, eat your veggies,

563
00:38:27,137 --> 00:38:29,097
burn everything but Shakespeare.
Who's Shakespeare?

564
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,557
Sheriff Rango,

565
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,267
if that is your real name.

566
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,561
I am trying to save my daddy's ranch,

567
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,688
which is on the verge of
an agricultural meltdown

568
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:39,472
while you're playing patty-cake
with this here trollop!

569
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:45,447
Sad, really.
Such a drab little thing.

570
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,407
Why does she do that?

571
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,992
It's a survival reflex.

572
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,618
Her switch is just broken.

573
00:38:50,702 --> 00:38:51,995
Well, that's an inconvenience.

574
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,373
It is not a rash!
It is a birthmark!

575
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,085
I did it again, didn't I?
Did what?

576
00:38:59,169 --> 00:39:01,129
Let me ask you something.

577
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:04,550
Did anybody here mention what
happened to our last sheriff?

578
00:39:44,756 --> 00:39:48,343
Pardon, but may I ask you...
Excuse me, may I ask you...

579
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:51,596
The... The last sheriff...
Pardon me.

580
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,181
Where is everybody going?

581
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,684

This is a heck of a hoedown
you got going.

594
00:40:48,695 --> 00:40:50,363
Still working out those steps.

595
00:40:50,447 --> 00:40:53,575
So, is this considered
normal civic behavior?

596
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:57,412
Mmm-hmm. Every Wednesday,
just like clockwork.

597
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:58,830
You kill bird.

598
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:01,916
Yeah. Matter of fact, I did.

599
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,586
Bird dead.
Snake come.

600
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,670
Snake?

601
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,422
He means Rattlesnake Jake, Mr. Rango.

602
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,757
He never comes to town, 'cause
he's scared of that hawk.

603
00:41:09,841 --> 00:41:11,093
But he might come now.

604
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,844
Can I have your boots when you're dead?

605
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:13,929
No!

606
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:16,431
And I ain't got no problem
with this Rattlesnake Jake.

607
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,308
That's just what Amos said.

608
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,352
Amos?

609
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:26,066
You got any gold fillings?

610
00:41:44,584 --> 00:41:47,003
<i>My fellow Dirtonians.</i>

611
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:51,257
<i>I welcome you to our great
day of deliverance.</i>

612
00:41:51,341 --> 00:41:53,968
<i>- Hallelujah.</i>
- Hallelujah!

613

<i>Acolytes, prepare the holy spigot!</i>

614
00:42:07,774 --> 00:42:11,319
<i>We have a newcomer amongst
us today, my friends.</i>

615
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:14,155
<i>A man I think needs little
introduction to you</i>

616
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:18,451
<i>so bold has been his entry
into our fair society.</i>

617
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:21,538
<i>Mr. Rango, would you step forward?</i>

618
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:30,129
<i>The time has come, my friends.</i>

619
00:42:30,213 --> 00:42:32,006
<i>The time that was foretold!</i>

620
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,841
Hallelujah!

621
00:42:33,925 --> 00:42:35,551
<i>The sacred time!</i>

622
00:42:35,635 --> 00:42:37,178
Hallelujah!

623
00:42:37,262 --> 00:42:39,681
<i>The time of destiny!</i>

624
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,182
Hallelujah!

625
00:42:41,266 --> 00:42:43,518
<i>The time of deliverance!</i>

626
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:44,978
Hallelujah!

627
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:49,274
<i>It is the time of hydration!</i>

628
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:07,041
It's his fault!
It's the newcomer!

629
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:08,876
- Burn him!
- He's a witch!

630
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,044
I get his boots!

631
00:43:10,128 --> 00:43:12,213
<i>My friends, my friends!</i>

632
00:43:12,297 --> 00:43:14,382
<i>Temper your frustrations.</i>

633
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,968
<i>Times will be tough from now on.</i>

634
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,554
<i>Sacrifices will have to be made.</i>

635
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,931
<i>But if I can help in any way,</i>

636
00:43:22,015 --> 00:43:23,099
<i>please know that my door is always...</i>

637
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,767
Hold it, hold it!

638
00:43:24,851 --> 00:43:27,729
Now, this whole thing stinks
three ways to Sunday.

639
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:30,523
First the bank's run dry
and now this here spigot?

640
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:32,316
The bank's run dry?
What's she talking about?

641
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,610
She said there's no water in the bank!

642
00:43:34,694 --> 00:43:35,695
Huh?

643
00:43:39,324 --> 00:43:42,869
This is all we have!
We can't give it all out!

644
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,621
That was my rehydration account!

645
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,083
None of that civil disobedience
in my town,

646
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:50,752
thank you very much.

647
00:43:51,628 --> 00:43:53,087
Oh. Oh!

648
00:43:53,171 --> 00:43:54,422
Thank goodness you're here, Sheriff.

649
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,758
Things were getting out of hand.

650
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,342
Uh, come right in.

651
00:43:58,426 --> 00:43:59,969
Let me have a gander at the source

652
00:44:00,053 --> 00:44:02,305
of the societal discontentment here.

653
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,642
Mercy.

654
00:44:06,726 --> 00:44:08,478
All right, listen up!

655
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:09,437
I've been thinking

656
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:12,315
and I believe I've figured something out.

657
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:14,943
You folks have a water problem!

658
00:44:17,028 --> 00:44:18,154
Now just pay attention, everybody.

659
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,614
I'm trying to make a point here.

660
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:22,450
Let's say this fella here were
to take a drink of water.

661
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:24,911
Just one little drink.
No harm, no foul, right?

662
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:29,957
And you!

663
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:31,084
Why, you're just as dried up

664
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,835
and parched as a jackrabbit in July.

665
00:44:32,919 --> 00:44:35,380
So you belly on up and
take you a double shot!

666
00:44:37,215 --> 00:44:38,383
Stay with me.

667
00:44:40,051 --> 00:44:42,261
What do you think happens then?

668
00:44:42,345 --> 00:44:44,305
Why we'd all be drinking!

669
00:44:44,389 --> 00:44:45,598
And before you know it,

670
00:44:45,682 --> 00:44:47,433
there wouldn't be any more water.

671
00:44:47,517 --> 00:44:49,311
And then where would we be?

672
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,355
We'd be thirsty.

673
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,108
Real thirsty.

674
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,819
We'd turn on each other
like a bunch of animals!

675
00:45:00,363 --> 00:45:05,452
Now look here.
We have got six days of water.

676
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:12,167
Five... We have got five days...

677
00:45:14,252 --> 00:45:16,087
As long as we've got water,

678
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:18,590
we've got ourselves a town.

679
00:45:19,257 --> 00:45:21,300
Sheriff Rango is right.

680
00:45:21,384 --> 00:45:25,012
As long as we have this
water, we have some hope.

681
00:45:25,096 --> 00:45:26,597
And you can all take it from me.

682
00:45:26,681 --> 00:45:30,351
My 100% full-time employment
from this moment on

683
00:45:30,435 --> 00:45:34,522
will be to protect our precious
natural resource.

684
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:37,984
Ain't no one gonna tango with the Rango.

685
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,748
Evening, ladies.

686
00:45:52,832 --> 00:45:54,500
Evening, Sheriff.

687
00:45:54,584 --> 00:45:55,918
And don't you come back!

688
00:45:56,002 --> 00:45:57,795
Whoa!
Hold on there, Gordy.

689
00:45:57,879 --> 00:46:00,006
Now, you get back in there
and you assert yourself,

690
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,091
and I think you'll find the
people of this here town

691
00:46:02,175 --> 00:46:03,885
to be surprisingly hospitable.

692
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,011
Thank you, Sheriff.

693
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,263
What?
Not you again!

694
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,849
I stand corrected.

695
00:46:16,481 --> 00:46:17,773
This ain't the bank.

696
00:46:17,857 --> 00:46:18,900
I told you, Jedidiah!

697
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:20,151
Hold it right there!

698
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:21,527
Who's that?
It's the Sheriff!

699
00:46:21,611 --> 00:46:23,561
Get them hands up where I can see them!

700
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,781
Just as I suspected.

701
00:46:25,865 --> 00:46:28,242
Prospecting without the
authorized equipment.

702
00:46:28,326 --> 00:46:30,912
Don't move a muscle.
Prospecting?

703
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:38,085
Now, you got your shovel,
pickaxe, Benadryl, loofah,

704
00:46:38,169 --> 00:46:39,462
assorted snacks, some puzzle books

705
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,547
and you're gonna need a permit.

706
00:46:41,631 --> 00:46:43,299
- Loofah.
- Ezekiel, Jedidiah!

707
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:45,551
What the Sam Hill's going on up there?

708
00:46:45,635 --> 00:46:48,721
I've had polyps removed smarter
than the two of you!

709
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:51,766
Hell's fire, this ain't the bank!

710
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:55,603
Pappy, the Sheriff is standing
right here, helping us out.

711
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:58,147
Gonna give us a permit for prospecting.

712
00:46:58,231 --> 00:46:59,315
That's right, sir.

713
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,651
Just doing my duty.

714
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,778
The lonely constable on his rounds,

715
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:06,948
keeping an eagle eye out for
mayhem and malfeasance.

716
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,157
Does he look like he sounds?

717
00:47:08,241 --> 00:47:10,201
Uh-huh.

718
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:14,205
Well, Sheriff, if we was
to hit the mother lode,

719
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:15,915
being prospectors and such,

720
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:19,293
where would we deposit said annuity?

721
00:47:19,377 --> 00:47:21,295
Well, here in the town of
Dirt, we happen to have

722
00:47:21,379 --> 00:47:24,466
the finest financial institution
this side of the Missouri.

723
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,970
Protected morning, noon
and night by yours truly.

724
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,265
Much obliged.

725
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,684
The bank's been robbed!

726
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:35,893
The bank's been robbed!

727
00:47:35,977 --> 00:47:38,354
Oh, good Lord, the bank's been robbed!

728
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:39,772
What's going on?

729
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:41,274
It's gone!
The water's all gone!

730
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:42,024
What'd he say?

731
00:47:42,108 --> 00:47:43,651
He said the bank's been robbed!

732
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,486
Whoa! Dr. Marx!
I'm on fire!

733
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:46,446
Embrace me!

734
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:50,283

All right, folks, stand
back, clear the area.

739
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,252
This is a crime scene now.

740
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:02,670
Secure the perimeter, dust for prints,

741
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:04,171
check for fibers, scan for DNA.

742
00:48:04,255 --> 00:48:07,258
I want a urine sample from everyone.
And get me a latte.

743
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,676
And don't mix up the two.

744
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,927
What's this?

745
00:48:10,011 --> 00:48:11,679
"Prospecting Permit."

746
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,431
I'll take that.
Material evidence.

747
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:14,932
What are we gonna do now, Sheriff?

748
00:48:15,016 --> 00:48:17,768
We need that water.
We're all going to die!

749
00:48:17,852 --> 00:48:21,480
My friends, we all know
what we have to do now.

750
00:48:21,564 --> 00:48:25,359
That's right.
We all know what we have to do now.

751
00:48:25,443 --> 00:48:27,695
And that would be?
Form a posse.

752
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,572
Form a possum!

753
00:48:31,991 --> 00:48:33,576
A posse.

754
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:38,289
Now, we're gonna be doing
this in an orderly fashion.

755
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,416
First off, does anybody here

756
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,420
know how to use a firearm of any kind?

757
00:48:46,005 --> 00:48:47,381
All right, then.

758
00:48:47,465 --> 00:48:49,300
What do we do now, Sheriff?

759
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:52,137
Now we ride!

760
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:07,276
Where are we going?

761
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,569
What?

762
00:49:08,653 --> 00:49:10,155
Where are we going?

763
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,580
Now, as my deputy, you'll be in charge

764
00:49:19,664 --> 00:49:21,374
of all tracking and finding of villains,

765
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,209
utilizing your well-developed Injun-uity,

766
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,502
no offense taken.

767
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,128
So which way do you think they went?

768
00:49:26,212 --> 00:49:29,462
You want to sniff the air, or commune
with a buffalo or something?

769
00:49:32,385 --> 00:49:34,137
Oh, you're good.

770
00:49:36,806 --> 00:49:38,891
I'm depending on you, Spoons.

771
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:41,394
You got a little tobaccy
in the beard there.

772
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:44,188
Always good to have a
medical man along, Doc.

773
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:47,108
Reptiles got to stick together,
right, my brother?

774
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,401
I'm an amphibian.

775
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:49,777
Ain't no shame in that.

776
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,197
Whoa!

777
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,992
You sure you're fit for
duty there, soldier?

778
00:49:57,702 --> 00:50:00,202
Well, you got a little something
in your eye there.

779
00:50:00,371 --> 00:50:01,539
Oh, that?

780
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:04,083
That there's conjunctivitis,
sir. It's hereditary.

781
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:07,212
Oh. Well, I'm glad to hear
it's not contagious.

782
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:10,256
Now, just wait a cotton-picking minute!

783
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,890
A posse ain't no place for a...

784
00:50:13,384 --> 00:50:14,593
Never mind.

785
00:50:14,677 --> 00:50:16,387
Whoa, hold on there, little sister.

786
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:19,557
Someone's gonna have to look
after the town while I'm gone.

787
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:22,810
Can I gut-shoot someone?

788
00:50:24,145 --> 00:50:26,147
Let's put a pin in that.

789
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:29,651
Sheriff, you're going to bring
that water back, aren't you?

790
00:50:30,568 --> 00:50:31,945
Count on it, little sister.

791
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:36,157
Which way do we go, Sheriff?

792
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,908
There's tunnels everywhere.

793
00:50:37,992 --> 00:50:39,952
Whole town's perforated with them.

794
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:42,246
How'd them fellers find the bank, anyway?

795
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:44,331
Gentlemen, if we can

796
00:50:44,415 --> 00:50:45,332
just stay on task here.

797
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:47,585
Sheriff!
Over here!

798
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,339
Would you look at that?

799
00:50:52,423 --> 00:50:54,258
Like seeing the face of God.

800
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:55,551
Amen, brother.

801
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:58,679
I remember when it used
to flow every Wednesday.

802
00:50:58,763 --> 00:51:00,723
Those were the halcyon days.

803
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:03,017
Must be a reason she quit on us.

804
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:07,104
Whatever the reason, something
is controlling this here water.

805
00:51:07,188 --> 00:51:08,397
What do you say, Sheriff?

806
00:51:08,481 --> 00:51:09,732
Er...

807
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:12,735
Clearly, the robbers came
from this direction.

808
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:15,154
I say we track this pipe back
to its hydraulic origin

809
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,907
and apprehend the culprits behind
this aquatic conundrum.

810
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:20,075
What'd he say?
I think he said follow the pipe.

811
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:22,829
He said follow the pipe.
He said follow the pipe.

812
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:38,177
Whatever you do, do not look down.

813
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:40,221
Whoa!

814
00:51:41,222 --> 00:51:42,515
What is this place?

815
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,099
It's an aquifer.

816
00:51:44,183 --> 00:51:45,518
Oh.

817
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,353
Wha...
What's an aquifer?

818
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,022
Well, it's for aqua.

819
00:51:50,481 --> 00:51:52,066
Well, it's empty now.

820
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,837
That's a big one.

821
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:18,676
It's the end of the line.
Don't go no further.

822
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,636
Someone or something

823
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,263
is messing with our hydration

824
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:24,473
and that pipe has got something
to do with it.

825
00:52:24,557 --> 00:52:26,392
I thought we was following bank robbers!

826
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,561
We're experiencing a paradigm shift.

827
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,938
I'm gonna shift the features on
your face if you don't shut up!

828
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,440
Oh, yeah?
Go ahead and try!

829
00:52:34,692 --> 00:52:36,569
Quiet, you savages!
Stop your rattling.

830
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,279
You're affecting my cogitation.

831
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:43,034
Whoa! I got it.
Snuff out them torches.

832
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,040
Sure enough.

833
00:52:50,124 --> 00:52:52,251
Smart thinking there, feller.

834
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,127
Start climbing.

835
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:55,254
Hey, get your foot out of my face!

836
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,547
Not bad, huh, Beans?

837
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,882
You keep thinking like that, your
hat's gonna catch on fire.

838
00:52:58,966 --> 00:53:01,468
Well, you know, you get
on a roll, you just...

839
00:53:01,552 --> 00:53:03,388
Hot, hot! Burn.

840
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,483
Poor things.

841
00:53:16,567 --> 00:53:18,235
All they wanted was a little water.

842
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:21,822
Cactus dying of thirst.
It don't bode well.

843
00:53:21,906 --> 00:53:23,782
- Hey! Hey, look what I found!
- What you got there?

844
00:53:23,866 --> 00:53:25,451
Hey, I saw that first!
They found some water!

845
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:26,744
Hey, that's mine!

846
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:28,329
Give me that!

847
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:30,664
Ah, it's empty anyway.

848
00:53:30,748 --> 00:53:32,333
I knew...
I knew that.

849
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,334
Hey, where'd you find that?

850
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:36,379
Sheriff! You're going
to want to see this!

851
00:53:39,924 --> 00:53:41,800
It's Mr. Merrimack from the bank.

852
00:53:41,884 --> 00:53:43,052
What's he doing here?

853
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:44,887
Everybody stand back.
All right, let me see.

854
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,514
Looks like them varmints
shot him in the back.

855
00:53:47,598 --> 00:53:49,851
No, this man wasn't shot.

856
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,852
He was drowned!

857
00:53:51,936 --> 00:53:53,854
Drowned?
In the middle of the desert?

858
00:53:53,938 --> 00:53:56,149
Oh, what a way to go.

859
00:53:58,067 --> 00:54:01,362
Well, now, whose boot prints are those?

860
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:09,370
That's interesting.
The ground's still wet.

861
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:11,163
I suppose we should bury him.

862
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:13,707
I don't know.
Birds got to eat, too.

863
00:54:13,791 --> 00:54:15,876
Circle of life!

864
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,963
Hey! What's that dad-gum Indian doing?

865
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,719
I see you're consulting with the spirits.

866
00:54:25,803 --> 00:54:27,721
No, I'm molting.

867
00:54:27,805 --> 00:54:29,723
Means I'm ready to mate.

868
00:54:29,807 --> 00:54:32,226
Oh. I'll keep that in mind.

869
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:34,061
Cactus fruit.

870
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:36,814
Ah, yes.
The ancient cactus fruit.

871
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:38,691
I believe your people use it as seasoning

872
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,401
when preparing your native dishes.

873
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:42,278
Also natural laxative.

874
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:44,988
Pick up trail.

875
00:54:45,072 --> 00:54:48,618
Three men heading west.
One blind, one with...

876
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:52,705
Enlarged prostate, riding sidesaddle.

877
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:53,747
What did he say?

878
00:54:53,831 --> 00:54:56,083
They're riding sidesaddle.
What?

879
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,459
We're whispering.
What'd he say?

880
00:54:57,543 --> 00:54:58,752
Someone's got a bad valve.

881
00:54:58,836 --> 00:55:01,436
All right, which one of you
fellers needs a check-up?

882
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:04,091
Awkward.

883
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:08,513
Uh... What exactly are
we going to do now?

884
00:55:09,263 --> 00:55:11,349
Now we ride!

885
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:19,941
That means we're riding now!
This moment.

886
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,319
Marshmallows remind me
of going camping with my daddy.

887
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:07,238
I could eat them all night long.

888
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:12,557
Of course he did make me cough them
back up again for breakfast.

889
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:16,163
This one time, I coughed up

890
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:17,539
an entire Dalmatian.

891
00:56:17,623 --> 00:56:21,377
That ain't nothing.
I coughed up a whole tribe of pygmies.

892
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:24,213
They started looking at me weird.

893
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:27,591
I remember them.
They was quite friendly.

894
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:31,262
I found a human spinal column
in my fecal matter once.

895
00:56:34,473 --> 00:56:37,351
You might want to get that looked at.

896
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:40,562
Oh.
Pass the beans, Beans.

897
00:56:40,646 --> 00:56:42,064
Sheriff?
Uh, no, thanks.

898
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:46,319
Mr. Rango? Can you tell us about
the Spirit of the West?

899
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,320
Yeah, tell us about that.

900
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:50,614
Is it true what they say?

901
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:54,535
Ah, yes, the Spirit of the West!

902
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:57,204
The eternally unattainable ideal.

903
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:59,915
They say he rides in
an alabaster carriage

904
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:02,543
with golden guardians to protect him.

905
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:05,727
But he only appears to those who
have undertaken an epic quest!

906
00:57:06,505 --> 00:57:07,881
And have made it

907
00:57:07,965 --> 00:57:09,508
to the other side.

908
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:15,931
Uh...
The other side of what?

909
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,683
It's a metaphor.

910
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:18,892
Ow! My eye!

911
00:57:18,976 --> 00:57:20,394
Uh, that's gonna heal right up.

912
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:24,690
Sheriff? What are you going
to do about Rattlesnake Jake?

913
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,275
What? Where?

914
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:29,027
Sorry about that.

915
00:57:29,111 --> 00:57:31,947
Word is you come against
him once or twice.

916
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:34,157
Oh, yeah.

917
00:57:34,241 --> 00:57:36,243
Jake.
You mean my brother.

918
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:38,912
Your brother?
That's what I said!

919
00:57:38,996 --> 00:57:41,957
But he's a snake and you're a lizard.

920
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,627
Well, Momma had an active social life.

921
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,254
Did he ever bite you?

922
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:49,506
Sure enough did.
Look at that baby.

923
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:50,674
Go ahead, you can touch it.

924
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,343
Ooh, that's interesting.

925
00:57:53,135 --> 00:57:54,761
That there's a belly button.

926
00:57:54,845 --> 00:57:56,179
Luckily, I'm immune to his venom.

927
00:57:56,263 --> 00:57:58,223
Put some in my coffee just
to give it a little tang.

928
00:57:58,307 --> 00:58:00,309
Is it true he's only
scared of them hawks?

929
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:03,229
Them's what we call his natural predator.

930
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,817
All this talk of that serpentine devil
is putting my quills on edge!

931
00:58:08,901 --> 00:58:10,903
I ain't sleeping tonight. No, sir.

932
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,112
Don't you all worry about a thing.

933
00:58:12,196 --> 00:58:14,156
Come tomorrow, we'll locate that water

934
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,367
and return to a hero's welcome.

935
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:20,037
Friends, before we bunk down

936
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:22,414
I'd like us all to join
hands for a moment,

937
00:58:22,498 --> 00:58:25,250
say a few words to the
Spirit of the West.

938
00:58:25,334 --> 00:58:27,169
Oh, yeah.
That's a good idea.

939
00:58:29,213 --> 00:58:32,716
Ain't always spoken rightly
to you, Spirit of the West.

940
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,927
But tonight I want to thank you

941
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:38,305
for bringing Sheriff
Rango into our lives.

942
00:58:39,056 --> 00:58:40,974
It's a hard life we got.

943
00:58:41,058 --> 00:58:44,311
Sometimes I don't know
how we're gonna make it.

944
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:48,649
But somehow, Sheriff Rango
makes me think we will.

945
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:51,736
We needed a brave man
and you sent us one.

946
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,239
Nice to have someone to believe in again.

947
00:58:56,073 --> 00:58:59,744
Thank you, Spirit of the West. Amen.

948
00:59:00,786 --> 00:59:02,538
Amen.
Amen.

949
00:59:34,236 --> 00:59:35,863
Just checking.

950
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:39,992
It's a little cold tonight.

951
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,285
Thank you.

952
00:59:43,704 --> 00:59:46,790
You ever feel like those
things are looking at you?

953
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:48,375
That's a Spanish dagger.

954
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:51,670
But around here, we just call
them the Walking Cactus.

955
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:52,587
Walking?

956
00:59:52,671 --> 00:59:54,548
There's an old legend they actually walk

957
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:56,508
across the desert to find water.

958
00:59:56,592 --> 00:59:58,385
When I was a little girl,
I'd stay up late

959
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:00,762
watching them, to see if they'd move.

960
01:00:00,846 --> 01:00:02,097
I thought if I could follow them,

961
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:04,433
they'd lead me to someplace wonderful.

962
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:08,270
Someplace with enough water for everyone.

963
01:00:09,313 --> 01:00:11,315
Night after night, I watched them.

964
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:14,860
I never saw them move.

965
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,194
But you're still watching.

966
01:00:16,278 --> 01:00:18,697
Who doesn't want to find
someplace wonderful?

967
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,491
We'll find the water, Beans.

968
01:00:21,575 --> 01:00:22,910
I promise you.

969
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,249
That's such a lonely sound.

970
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:30,793
You ever get lonely?

971
01:00:31,627 --> 01:00:32,919
Sometimes.

972
01:00:33,003 --> 01:00:34,212
I can't imagine it.

973
01:00:34,296 --> 01:00:37,924
You're such a charmer and
everyone likes you so much.

974
01:00:38,008 --> 01:00:40,761
I never made friends easy like that.

975
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:41,803
No?

976
01:00:41,887 --> 01:00:44,097
No, we're pretty isolated
out there on the ranch,

977
01:00:44,181 --> 01:00:47,059
sort of like being sealed
up in a little box.

978
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,811
Don't really see a lot of folks.

979
01:00:49,895 --> 01:00:52,481
I wouldn't know what that's like.

980
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:56,109
There someone special
in your life, Rango?

981
01:00:56,193 --> 01:00:57,944
Oh, well, there used to be.

982
01:00:58,028 --> 01:00:59,446
But she couldn't keep her head.

983
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,615
Besides, my life's too dangerous
for that kind of thing.

984
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:05,160
You know, it's an awful solitary
existence out there on the prairie.

985
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:06,994
Riding the ranges and the suchlike.

986
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:10,541
Beans?

987
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,377
Beans?

988
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:32,562
I'm gonna skin you alive, boy!

989
01:01:32,646 --> 01:01:34,481
I'm gonna whup you like
a red-headed stepchild!

990
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:35,690
Choleric varmints, ain't they?

991
01:01:35,774 --> 01:01:38,903
Dysfunctional family.
Need intervention.

992
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,363
What's that coming?

993
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:44,825
It's the water.

994
01:01:47,077 --> 01:01:48,328
I have a plan,

995
01:01:48,412 --> 01:01:50,956
and each and every one of
you has a part to play.

996
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,207
What do I do?

997
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:53,917
Spoons, you got the most
important job of all.

998
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:56,753
You stay up here on the ridge,
and if anything goes wrong,

999
01:01:56,837 --> 01:01:59,590
you give the signal.

1000
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:13,603
Hey... hey, Beans.
What size dress you wearing?

1001
01:02:13,687 --> 01:02:16,356
He got it!
Hallelujah!

1002
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,316
He found the water!
You did it, son.

1003
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,526
Well, actually...

1004
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,820
Why can't you be all brainy
like your brother?

1005
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:23,363
Pappy, about that water.

1006
01:02:23,447 --> 01:02:24,489
There's something I gots to tell you.

1007
01:02:24,573 --> 01:02:26,617
Hush! Hush up, now.
Somebody's coming.

1008
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:31,204
Good sirs, gracious good afternoon

1009
01:02:31,288 --> 01:02:32,581
to thee, and thee, and thee.

1010
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:34,875
May I present Madame Lupone's

1011
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:37,628
Terpsichorean Troupe of
Traveling Thespians!

1012
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,464
What is that?
I think they's thespians.

1013
01:02:41,548 --> 01:02:44,843
Thespians?
That's illegal in seven states!

1014
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:45,844
The stage is set.

1015
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:48,722
The princess prepares
to take her own life.

1016
01:02:48,806 --> 01:02:50,056
I yearn for love.

1017
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:53,435
Meanwhile, the lone sentry stands
watch at the castle gate.

1018
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:56,271
Hark! Who goes there?

1019
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:58,148
This plot is highly predictable.

1020
01:02:58,232 --> 01:02:59,566
Quiet! This is my favorite part.

1021
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:02,611
Arriving to great fanfare
'twas her aged father...

1022
01:03:06,156 --> 01:03:07,866
strucketh by Cupid.

1023
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,201
Huh!

1024
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:12,162
Prithee, unhand my fair daughter

1025
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:13,914
and reach for the...

1026
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:16,708
Uh, line?

1027
01:03:16,792 --> 01:03:18,377
"Reach for the sky!"

1028
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,255
Wha... what was that?

1029
01:03:22,339 --> 01:03:24,299
M... M... Must be that
immersive theater.

1030
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:25,884
We got you surrounded!

1031
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,219
You and your entire family

1032
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:29,012
get your hands up where I can see them.

1033
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:32,099
My entire family?

1034
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:41,316
♪ <i>Grits and spit And collard greens</i>

1035
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:45,654
♪ <i>Waffle chitlins Monkey brains</i>

1036
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:49,366
♪ <i>Refried bones And booger blood</i>

1037
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:53,078
♪ <i>Pickled eggs And flaps of mud</i> ♪

1038
01:03:55,247 --> 01:03:58,625
It's a full house.

1039
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:00,001
Looks like we're gonna have ourselves

1040
01:04:00,085 --> 01:04:01,962
a good old-fashioned standoff.

1041
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:06,175
Ahem! I'll have you know, you're not
looking at our entire contingent.

1042
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:15,934
What's that...
What's that supposed to be?

1043
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,310
That's the signal.

1044
01:04:17,394 --> 01:04:18,979
Tha... that's the signal!

1045
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:20,613
Something must have gone wrong!

1046
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:28,072
So, uh, something's supposed to happen?

1047
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:32,326
I... am open to suggestions.

1048
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:41,710
Run!

1049
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:49,426
Get on the wagon!

1050
01:04:55,557 --> 01:04:58,101
Should we have ourselves
some sport, chill'ens?

1051
01:04:58,185 --> 01:05:01,021
I... I likes it when they run.

1052
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:03,941
Maybelle, give the holler!

1053
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:11,698
Looks like we made it!

1054
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:13,241
That audience was quite responsive.

1055
01:05:13,325 --> 01:05:16,225
Yeah, well, I think that chromosome
pool is about dried up.

1056
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:45,149
We got bats!

1057
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:46,566
Uh, here!

1058
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:47,901
You drive.

1059
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:58,328
Looks like there's gonna be soup tonight!

1060
01:05:58,412 --> 01:06:00,080
Come on, let's get some!

1061
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:13,426
What in tarnation?
Don't shoot the water!

1062
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:17,097
Jedidiah! It's time for
the Alabama squeeze box!

1063
01:06:17,181 --> 01:06:18,640
Okay, Pa!

1064
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:27,357
I am sensing hostility.

1065
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:28,859
Incoming!

1066
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:35,824
Hello!

1067
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:37,201
Goodbye!

1068
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:49,046
Lasso that swine!

1069
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:56,053
Huh?

1070
01:07:09,733 --> 01:07:11,484
I suggest we take evasive action!

1071
01:07:11,568 --> 01:07:13,319
I suggest you shut up and shoot!

1072
01:07:13,403 --> 01:07:14,362
What happened to the Sheriff?

1073
01:07:14,446 --> 01:07:16,197
He had a previous engagement!

1074
01:07:16,281 --> 01:07:19,117
Boseefus, give them some gumbo now!

1075
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,834
What was that?
Go check it out!

1076
01:07:29,753 --> 01:07:31,255
What is it?
Is there a problem?

1077
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:35,133
Uh, you could call it that.

1078
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:44,601
Ah!

1079
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,604
Whee!

1080
01:07:54,444 --> 01:07:55,654
Huh?

1081
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:15,132
Huh?

1082
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:24,808
Headache.

1083
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:28,979
Is that all you got?

1084
01:08:45,537 --> 01:08:46,996
Whoo hoo!

1085
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:49,041
That wasn't altogether unpleasant!

1086
01:08:51,168 --> 01:08:52,169
Eat lead!

1087
01:09:02,679 --> 01:09:04,056
Here, hold these.

1088
01:09:15,192 --> 01:09:16,443
Get your hands off me!

1089
01:09:20,864 --> 01:09:21,948
Ow!

1090
01:09:22,032 --> 01:09:23,200
Oh, I'm sorry.

1091
01:09:26,244 --> 01:09:27,371
Whoa!

1092
01:09:32,376 --> 01:09:33,377
Jump!

1093
01:09:56,483 --> 01:09:57,901
It's impossible.

1094
01:09:58,568 --> 01:10:01,029
It can't be.
It's empty.

1095
01:10:01,571 --> 01:10:03,072
There's no water!

1096
01:10:03,156 --> 01:10:06,701
No water?
Then what the hell we been fighting for?

1097
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:08,870
Sir, you have defiled and desecrated

1098
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:11,080
the very sustenance of our livelihood!

1099
01:10:11,164 --> 01:10:13,541
I think that there fella in the
purty dress is the Sheriff.

1100
01:10:13,625 --> 01:10:16,210
That's the same fellow what
give us a prospecting permit?

1101
01:10:16,294 --> 01:10:17,170
A what?

1102
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:19,130
Irrelevant! Obfuscation.

1103
01:10:19,214 --> 01:10:21,257
You and your kin are under
arrest for bank robbery

1104
01:10:21,341 --> 01:10:23,176
and the murder of our beloved
financial advisor

1105
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:27,347
Johannes Merrimack the
Third, AKA, Fluffy Joe.

1106
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:28,681
Sheriff, we didn't kill nobody.

1107
01:10:28,765 --> 01:10:29,932
We done tunneled into that vault,

1108
01:10:30,016 --> 01:10:31,184
but there weren't nothing in it.

1109
01:10:31,268 --> 01:10:33,353
Somebody done robbed that
bank before we robbed it.

1110
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:35,021
Then where'd you get this here jug?

1111
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:37,023
That's what I been trying
to tell you, Pappy.

1112
01:10:37,107 --> 01:10:38,608
I found it in the desert.

1113
01:10:38,692 --> 01:10:41,569
Then why in tarnation
did you bring it here?

1114
01:10:41,653 --> 01:10:43,821
Hold on! Hold on!
You're saying

1115
01:10:43,905 --> 01:10:45,865
this here jug was empty
when you found it?

1116
01:10:45,949 --> 01:10:47,450
Uh-huh.
That's right.

1117
01:10:47,534 --> 01:10:48,576
I don't believe a word of it.

1118
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:50,119
Let's hang them, Sheriff!
String them up!

1119
01:10:50,203 --> 01:10:52,372
Who would dump water in the desert?

1120
01:10:52,456 --> 01:10:54,165
Wouldn't be the first time.

1121
01:10:54,249 --> 01:10:57,460
It's a puzzle! It's like
a big old mammogram!

1122
01:10:57,544 --> 01:10:59,420
What's going on, Sheriff?

1123
01:10:59,504 --> 01:11:00,588
I don't know.

1124
01:11:00,672 --> 01:11:02,131
But I'm going to strip away this mystery

1125
01:11:02,215 --> 01:11:04,759
and expose its private parts.

1126
01:11:04,843 --> 01:11:07,429
You and your kin are coming with me.

1127
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,393
They're coming!

1128
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:14,811
Here they come!

1129
01:11:16,062 --> 01:11:17,712
Looks like they got them robbers.

1130
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:42,339
Where's the water?

1131
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:47,427
There weren't no water.

1132
01:12:01,525 --> 01:12:03,109
Where...
where is he going?

1133
01:12:04,194 --> 01:12:06,279
He's going to see the Mayor.

1134
01:12:08,698 --> 01:12:10,783
Ah, he's got to be pleased with that.

1135
01:12:10,867 --> 01:12:12,369
That's a good one, boss!

1136
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:23,671
That's interesting.

1137
01:12:23,755 --> 01:12:26,424
I do apologize for the shoes, Mr. Rango,

1138
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:30,011
but there's a certain protocol
to this game, you understand.

1139
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:32,263
I'm a bit of a stickler for protocol.

1140
01:12:32,347 --> 01:12:35,475
Well, that's good, 'cause you
got a few questions to answer

1141
01:12:35,559 --> 01:12:37,060
and I've got my own protocol.

1142
01:12:41,606 --> 01:12:44,525
But why would anyone dump water
in the blooming desert?

1143
01:12:44,609 --> 01:12:48,863
It does seem a bit naive, taking
the word of admitted bank robbers.

1144
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:52,575
Besides, once they hang,
your job is done.

1145
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:54,160
Bravo!
Job well done.

1146
01:12:54,244 --> 01:12:57,163
But what if somebody did rob the
bank before they got there?

1147
01:12:57,247 --> 01:12:59,665
And who would do that, Mr. Rango?

1148
01:12:59,749 --> 01:13:01,918
I was hoping you could tell me.

1149
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:05,004
That sounds marginally
near to an accusation.

1150
01:13:05,088 --> 01:13:06,464
Take it any way you like.

1151
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:08,341
Ow!

1152
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:15,890
Something you said keeps
rattling around in my frontal lobe.

1153
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:17,809
What's that?

1154
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:21,687
"Control the water and
you control everything."

1155
01:13:21,771 --> 01:13:24,273
Come now, Mr. Rango.

1156
01:13:24,357 --> 01:13:27,276
You attribute divine power to me.

1157
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:30,488
How on earth could I possibly
control the water?

1158
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:36,202
You've obviously mastered this game.

1159
01:13:36,286 --> 01:13:39,705
Well, I've been playing
it for many years, sir.

1160
01:13:39,789 --> 01:13:42,917
I was here before the highway
split this great valley.

1161
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:45,920
I watched the march of progress,

1162
01:13:46,004 --> 01:13:48,714
and I learned a thing or two.

1163
01:13:48,798 --> 01:13:52,009
Perhaps it's time you started
to take the long view,

1164
01:13:52,093 --> 01:13:55,680
begin to appreciate the
broad sweep of history.

1165
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:58,266
Look out there, son.

1166
01:13:59,142 --> 01:14:01,519
You can almost see time passing.

1167
01:14:04,898 --> 01:14:06,732
What are you building out here?

1168
01:14:06,816 --> 01:14:10,236
The future, Mr. Rango, the future.

1169
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:14,073
One day soon, all this is
going to fade into myth,

1170
01:14:14,157 --> 01:14:17,076
the frontier town, the
lawman, the gunslinger.

1171
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,495
There's just no place for them anymore.

1172
01:14:19,579 --> 01:14:20,913
We're civilized now.

1173
01:14:20,997 --> 01:14:23,374
That's right, civilized.

1174
01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:25,167
That's what the future holds.

1175
01:14:25,251 --> 01:14:26,961
You can either be part of it,

1176
01:14:27,045 --> 01:14:29,005
or you can be left behind.

1177
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:31,549
Is that what happened to Mr. Merrimack?

1178
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:32,967
Did he get left behind?

1179
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:34,510
Careful, Mr. Rango.

1180
01:14:34,594 --> 01:14:38,055
You seem to forget you're
just one little lizard.

1181
01:14:38,139 --> 01:14:39,765
You seem to forget

1182
01:14:39,849 --> 01:14:42,143
I'm the law around these parts.

1183
01:14:44,604 --> 01:14:47,773
Our new sheriff has been playing
the hero for so long,

1184
01:14:47,857 --> 01:14:49,707
he's actually starting to believe it.

1185
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:52,862
Call in Rattlesnake Jake.

1186
01:14:52,946 --> 01:14:55,364
But Jake's the Grim Reaper.

1187
01:14:55,448 --> 01:14:57,950
He never leaves without
taking a blooming soul.

1188
01:14:58,034 --> 01:14:59,244
Do it!

1189
01:15:13,967 --> 01:15:15,134
Now be still.

1190
01:15:15,218 --> 01:15:17,971
You gotta look presentable
to meet your maker.

1191
01:15:23,768 --> 01:15:27,480
♪ <i>Death has arrived</i>

1192
01:15:31,526 --> 01:15:36,322
♪ <i>How will the hero survive?</i> ♪

1193
01:15:39,743 --> 01:15:42,954
The Mayor has bought up all
the land in the valley,

1194
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:45,122
except for your ranch, Miss Beans.

1195
01:15:45,206 --> 01:15:46,832
That just don't make no sense.

1196
01:15:46,916 --> 01:15:49,001
Without water, that land is useless.

1197
01:15:49,085 --> 01:15:51,921
Unless he controls the water.

1198
01:15:52,005 --> 01:15:53,506
Like a monkey's bladder!

1199
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:56,175
Then he could bring it back once
he's bought up all the land.

1200
01:15:56,259 --> 01:15:58,386
But how does he control the water?

1201
01:15:59,179 --> 01:16:01,139
Sheriff, we got a problem.

1202
01:16:08,021 --> 01:16:11,274
Hold on, Beans.
That won't be necessary.

1203
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:17,989
Hang him till his head turns blue!
Give us them robbers!

1204
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:20,199
Hold on! Calm down,
everyone Let me talk!

1205
01:16:20,283 --> 01:16:22,785
- Nail them to the courthouse!
- Now, calm down.

1206
01:16:22,869 --> 01:16:25,789
Get them out here so we can
cut off their giblets!

1207
01:16:26,498 --> 01:16:27,832
You, too, Spoons?

1208
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:31,377
They done taken that water.
They taken everything we got!

1209
01:16:31,461 --> 01:16:34,380
No one's stringing anyone up.
Not while I'm sheriff.

1210
01:16:34,464 --> 01:16:35,673
But this is all his fault!

1211
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:38,175
You said you's gonna
bring the water back.

1212
01:16:38,259 --> 01:16:41,137
It's just, we got no hope
without that water.

1213
01:16:41,221 --> 01:16:43,472
We got nothing left to believe in.

1214
01:16:43,556 --> 01:16:45,933
You see that sign up there?

1215
01:16:46,017 --> 01:16:47,935
As long as that sign says "Sheriff,"

1216
01:16:48,019 --> 01:16:50,730
you can believe that there's
law and order in this town.

1217
01:16:50,814 --> 01:16:52,523
But without law and order,

1218
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,899
ruminate on that.

1219
01:16:53,983 --> 01:16:55,067
Oh, yeah.

1220
01:16:55,151 --> 01:16:57,820
Starts out slow, like a fungus.

1221
01:16:57,904 --> 01:17:00,823
Somebody says a cross word.
Accusations start flying.

1222
01:17:00,907 --> 01:17:02,074
Neighbor turns on neighbor.

1223
01:17:02,158 --> 01:17:03,492
Pretty soon, we're eating our children!

1224
01:17:03,576 --> 01:17:04,744
And then dogs and cats
are getting together

1225
01:17:04,828 --> 01:17:07,455
to create all sorts of unnatural
mutant aberrations!

1226
01:17:08,706 --> 01:17:11,751
So, you want something
to believe in, Spoons?

1227
01:17:13,002 --> 01:17:14,379
Believe in me.

1228
01:17:16,005 --> 01:17:18,591
Believe in that there sign.

1229
01:17:18,675 --> 01:17:22,137
For as long as it hangs
there, we got hope.

1230
01:17:47,745 --> 01:17:50,206
Hello, brother.

1231
01:17:50,748 --> 01:17:51,749
Thirsty?

1232
01:18:03,136 --> 01:18:07,681
Long time, brother.
How you been keeping?

1233
01:18:07,765 --> 01:18:09,559
Oh, well, you know...

1234
01:18:11,811 --> 01:18:16,315
I hear you been telling about how you
killed all them Jenkins brothers.

1235
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:19,235
With one bullet, wasn't it?

1236
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:20,612
Isn't that right?

1237
01:18:21,362 --> 01:18:22,988
All these good folks here

1238
01:18:23,072 --> 01:18:25,658
believe your little stories, don't they?

1239
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:29,829
Why, they believe you're just
a stone killer, don't they?

1240
01:18:29,913 --> 01:18:32,748
Seems these folks trust you.

1241
01:18:32,832 --> 01:18:36,127
They think you're gonna
save their little town.

1242
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:39,505
They think you're gonna
save their little souls!

1243
01:18:43,426 --> 01:18:47,305
But we know better, don't we?

1244
01:18:52,518 --> 01:18:56,188
So why don't you show your friends
here what you're made of?

1245
01:18:56,272 --> 01:18:59,316
Show them who you really are.

1246
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,403
Why don't you just pull
your gun and shoot me?

1247
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:05,614
But, of course, you won't need all these.

1248
01:19:05,698 --> 01:19:07,575
Just one, right?

1249
01:19:09,661 --> 01:19:12,956
Go ahead, hero.
Pull the trigger.

1250
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:18,711
You got killer in your eyes, son?

1251
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:22,048
I don't see it.

1252
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:28,512
You didn't do any of them
things you said, did you?

1253
01:19:28,596 --> 01:19:30,973
You didn't kill them Jenkins brothers.

1254
01:19:31,057 --> 01:19:32,767
You ain't even from the West!

1255
01:19:33,017 --> 01:19:34,477
Are you?

1256
01:19:34,978 --> 01:19:35,979
Say it!

1257
01:19:37,021 --> 01:19:38,689
No.
Oh, speak up.

1258
01:19:38,773 --> 01:19:41,484
I don't think your friends
here heard you.

1259
01:19:43,403 --> 01:19:44,486
No.

1260
01:19:44,570 --> 01:19:46,739
All you've done is lie
to these good people.

1261
01:19:46,823 --> 01:19:49,450
You ain't nothing but
a fake and a coward.

1262
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:51,035
Isn't that right?

1263
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,621
Yes.
Louder!

1264
01:19:53,997 --> 01:19:55,331
Yes!

1265
01:19:58,835 --> 01:20:02,129
Listen close, you pathetic fraud.

1266
01:20:02,213 --> 01:20:05,257
This is my town now.

1267
01:20:05,341 --> 01:20:06,717
If I ever see you again,

1268
01:20:06,801 --> 01:20:09,804
I will take your soul
straight down to hell!

1269
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,905
Who... who are you?

1270
01:22:25,189 --> 01:22:26,566
<i>Who am I?</i>

1271
01:22:28,818 --> 01:22:29,986
<i>I'm nobody.</i>

1272
01:24:10,169 --> 01:24:12,797
Ow!

1273
01:24:24,517 --> 01:24:26,018
Golden guardians.

1274
01:24:28,604 --> 01:24:30,064
The alabaster carriage.

1275
01:24:35,111 --> 01:24:37,029
The Spirit of the West.

1276
01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:40,658
Um...

1277
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:45,871
Excuse me?
Mister Spirit, sir?

1278
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:49,500
Ah. There's a beaut.

1279
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:53,254
Sometimes you got to dig deep to
find what you're looking for.

1280
01:24:55,298 --> 01:24:56,382
So you made it.

1281
01:24:57,425 --> 01:24:58,842
Is this Heaven?

1282
01:24:58,926 --> 01:25:02,305
If it were, we'd be eating
Pop-Tarts with Kim Novak.

1283
01:25:02,763 --> 01:25:04,056
Yeah.

1284
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:05,141
No kidding.

1285
01:25:06,392 --> 01:25:07,643
What are you doing out here?

1286
01:25:07,727 --> 01:25:09,811
Searching, same as you.

1287
01:25:09,895 --> 01:25:14,233
I don't even know
what I'm looking for anymore.

1288
01:25:14,317 --> 01:25:15,818
I don't even know who I am.

1289
01:25:17,111 --> 01:25:19,211
They used to call you
the Man with No Name.

1290
01:25:20,323 --> 01:25:24,076
These days they got a name
for just about everything.

1291
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,245
Doesn't matter what they call you.

1292
01:25:26,329 --> 01:25:28,580
It's the deeds make the man.

1293
01:25:28,664 --> 01:25:30,541
Yeah, but my deeds just
made things worse.

1294
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:32,626
I'm a fraud.
I'm a phony!

1295
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:34,044
My friends believed in me,

1296
01:25:34,128 --> 01:25:36,922
but they need some kind of hero.

1297
01:25:37,006 --> 01:25:38,423
Then be a hero.

1298
01:25:38,507 --> 01:25:40,884
Oh, no. No, no, you don't understand.

1299
01:25:40,968 --> 01:25:42,427
I'm not even supposed to be here.

1300
01:25:42,511 --> 01:25:43,804
That's right.

1301
01:25:43,888 --> 01:25:46,849
You came a long way to find something
that isn't out here.

1302
01:25:47,892 --> 01:25:50,770
Don't you see?
It's not about you.

1303
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:53,189
It's about them.

1304
01:25:56,150 --> 01:25:57,609
But I can't go back.

1305
01:25:57,693 --> 01:25:59,862
Don't know that you got a choice, son.

1306
01:26:03,866 --> 01:26:06,702
No man can walk out on his own story.

1307
01:26:19,215 --> 01:26:20,466
So you made it.

1308
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:23,927
That's right, <i>amigo.</i>

1309
01:26:24,011 --> 01:26:26,180
The other side of the road.

1310
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:31,393
Did you just see that?

1311
01:26:31,477 --> 01:26:33,854
We each see what we need to see.

1312
01:26:35,231 --> 01:26:37,066
Beautiful, isn't it?

1313
01:26:49,245 --> 01:26:50,246
Yeah.

1314
01:26:51,414 --> 01:26:52,956
It is.

1315
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:56,419
Come, my friend. I want
to show you something.

1316
01:27:00,047 --> 01:27:04,885
Many years ago, this entire
valley was covered in <i>agua.</i>

1317
01:27:05,594 --> 01:27:09,181
Now only one question remains.

1318
01:27:10,641 --> 01:27:12,101
Where did it go?

1319
01:27:46,969 --> 01:27:48,471
They follow the water.

1320
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:52,099
They follow the water!
Come on!

1321
01:28:27,343 --> 01:28:29,261
<i>That just don't make no sense.</i>

1322
01:28:29,345 --> 01:28:31,931
<i>Without water, that land is useless.</i>

1323
01:28:32,681 --> 01:28:34,599
What are you building out here?

1324
01:28:34,683 --> 01:28:36,643
The future, Mr. Rango.

1325
01:28:36,727 --> 01:28:38,937
<i>You can either be part of it,</i>

1326
01:28:39,021 --> 01:28:41,023
<i>or you can be left behind.</i>

1327
01:28:43,442 --> 01:28:46,612
<i>I was here before the highway
split this great valley.</i>

1328
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:52,200
<i>I watched the march of progress,</i>

1329
01:28:52,284 --> 01:28:54,245
<i>and I learned a thing or two.</i>

1330
01:29:00,042 --> 01:29:01,460
Control the water...

1331
01:29:02,169 --> 01:29:04,213
and you control everything.

1332
01:29:11,554 --> 01:29:13,138
<i>Come now, Mr. Rango.</i>

1333
01:29:13,222 --> 01:29:15,432
<i>You attribute divine power to me.</i>

1334
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:18,310
<i>How on earth could I possibly
control the water?</i>

1335
01:29:55,097 --> 01:29:56,599
What now, <i>amigo?</i>

1336
01:30:04,773 --> 01:30:07,318
No man can walk out on his own story.

1337
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:10,446
I'm going back.

1338
01:30:12,364 --> 01:30:13,449
But why?

1339
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:16,327
Because that's who I am.

1340
01:30:28,964 --> 01:30:31,883
You got a lot of nerve
showing up here, lawman.

1341
01:30:31,967 --> 01:30:33,594
What is it you want?

1342
01:30:34,511 --> 01:30:36,555
Your pappy and them boys
are about to hang

1343
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:38,098
for something they didn't do.

1344
01:30:39,808 --> 01:30:41,393
But I've got a plan.

1345
01:31:09,463 --> 01:31:12,424
I appreciate how difficult
this is for you, Beans.

1346
01:31:12,508 --> 01:31:15,468
But you're making a practical decision.

1347
01:31:15,552 --> 01:31:18,138
Decisions, decisions.

1348
01:31:18,222 --> 01:31:21,058
There's no need for any more suffering.

1349
01:31:27,815 --> 01:31:31,693
Your family's ranch is nothing
but a wasteland now.

1350
01:31:31,777 --> 01:31:36,740
Sign the deed and relieve yourself
of your father's burden.

1351
01:31:38,951 --> 01:31:41,411
My daddy was not a burden!

1352
01:31:41,495 --> 01:31:44,248
Keep your blood money
and I'll keep my land!

1353
01:31:50,379 --> 01:31:53,173
Do what he says or, by all
the fires of the black pit,

1354
01:31:53,257 --> 01:31:57,302
I'll squeeze them pretty brown
eyes out of your skull!

1355
01:31:57,386 --> 01:31:59,012
Now, hold on, Jake.

1356
01:31:59,096 --> 01:31:59,888
There's no need to...

1357
01:31:59,972 --> 01:32:02,182
Let me do my job!
You brought me in.

1358
01:32:02,266 --> 01:32:05,227
Now we're gonna play this
thing out to the end!

1359
01:32:05,894 --> 01:32:08,355
Sign the damn paper, woman!

1360
01:32:08,731 --> 01:32:10,231
Go to hell!

1361
01:32:10,315 --> 01:32:13,485
Where do you think I come from?

1362
01:32:13,569 --> 01:32:15,695
Look into my eyes.

1363
01:32:15,779 --> 01:32:18,282
I want to see you die.

1364
01:32:23,454 --> 01:32:24,496
Jake!

1365
01:32:27,916 --> 01:32:29,626
I'm calling you out!

1366
01:32:32,296 --> 01:32:33,922
Jake!

1367
01:32:34,006 --> 01:32:38,093
This day just got a little
more interesting.

1368
01:33:05,746 --> 01:33:06,913
Put her down.

1369
01:33:06,997 --> 01:33:08,873
Or what, little man?

1370
01:33:08,957 --> 01:33:10,709
You going to kill me?

1371
01:33:10,793 --> 01:33:12,503
That's just about the size of it.

1372
01:33:15,089 --> 01:33:16,715
Get your filthy paws off me!

1373
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:18,008
Shut your gob!

1374
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:21,220
All right, Sheriff, make your move.

1375
01:34:53,187 --> 01:34:54,521
Now, <i>amigos!</i>

1376
01:34:59,234 --> 01:35:01,862
Heave! Heave!

1377
01:35:10,913 --> 01:35:11,955
Ow!

1378
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:21,506
That was a bad idea.

1379
01:35:25,802 --> 01:35:26,929
Thirsty, brother?

1380
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:28,472
Huh?

1381
01:35:30,766 --> 01:35:32,517
Here it comes!

1382
01:35:34,728 --> 01:35:35,771
No. No!

1383
01:35:40,025 --> 01:35:41,568
It's a miracle!

1384
01:35:41,652 --> 01:35:42,903
Look out!

1385
01:35:49,993 --> 01:35:51,703
Lookee there!
What is that?

1386
01:35:53,413 --> 01:35:55,123
It's our salvation, Pa!

1387
01:35:55,207 --> 01:35:57,960
It's a jailbreak, boys!
We're busting out!

1388
01:36:08,178 --> 01:36:10,180
I'm gonna blow so many holes in you,

1389
01:36:10,264 --> 01:36:12,265
your guts'll be leaking lead!

1390
01:36:12,349 --> 01:36:14,849
Well, then it's a good thing
I brought some backup.

1391
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:27,823
What?

1392
01:36:31,243 --> 01:36:33,077
Ain't no hawk.

1393
01:36:33,161 --> 01:36:34,579
Ain't nothing but bats!

1394
01:36:37,666 --> 01:36:41,503
Stick to the plan, boys!
Let's bleed that devil dry!

1395
01:36:50,178 --> 01:36:51,513
Huh?

1396
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:55,934
It only takes one bullet.

1397
01:36:56,018 --> 01:36:57,811
You ain't got the nerve.

1398
01:36:59,229 --> 01:37:00,522
Try me.

1399
01:37:05,193 --> 01:37:07,070
Oh, Mr. Rango.

1400
01:37:07,154 --> 01:37:08,864
Aren't you forgetting something?

1401
01:37:14,286 --> 01:37:16,371
Hand me your gun, Sheriff.

1402
01:37:19,207 --> 01:37:20,792
Now, Mr. Rango.

1403
01:37:32,888 --> 01:37:35,015
Beans! Hold on.
Don't worry, I got a plan.

1404
01:37:36,099 --> 01:37:38,226
Help!

1405
01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:40,062
Open the door!

1406
01:37:41,730 --> 01:37:42,855
Okay, plan B.

1407
01:37:42,939 --> 01:37:44,148
What?

1408
01:37:44,232 --> 01:37:45,483
Beans, you're mumbling.

1409
01:37:45,567 --> 01:37:49,863
All my problems taken care
of, except for one.

1410
01:37:50,489 --> 01:37:51,489
It's a new West, Jake.

1411
01:37:51,573 --> 01:37:54,450
There's no room for gunslingers anymore.

1412
01:37:54,534 --> 01:37:56,202
We're businessmen now.

1413
01:37:56,286 --> 01:37:57,912
Yeah, we got new hats.

1414
01:37:57,996 --> 01:38:01,333
Where I come from, we call
this improvisation.

1415
01:38:03,126 --> 01:38:04,419
You came back.

1416
01:38:10,050 --> 01:38:12,010
Hmm?

1417
01:38:12,094 --> 01:38:14,095
What was that?

1418
01:38:14,179 --> 01:38:15,179
No need to panic,

1419
01:38:15,263 --> 01:38:16,889
but I think you just swallowed plan B.

1420
01:38:16,973 --> 01:38:17,974
What?

1421
01:38:19,893 --> 01:38:21,102
Okay, panic time.

1422
01:38:21,186 --> 01:38:24,272
You and the Sheriff are more
alike than you think.

1423
01:38:24,356 --> 01:38:26,149
You're nothing but legends.

1424
01:38:26,233 --> 01:38:29,986
Pretty soon, no one will
believe you even existed.

1425
01:38:33,281 --> 01:38:36,034
One last bullet to kill one last outlaw.

1426
01:38:38,412 --> 01:38:40,038
How fitting.

1427
01:38:40,122 --> 01:38:41,748
What?

1428
01:39:14,072 --> 01:39:16,324
Now, Sheriff, I'm sure
if we work together,

1429
01:39:16,408 --> 01:39:18,576
we can reach a mutually
beneficial solution

1430
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:20,578
to our current situation.

1431
01:39:20,662 --> 01:39:22,747
You better take it up with him.

1432
01:39:34,509 --> 01:39:36,011
One bullet.

1433
01:39:37,387 --> 01:39:39,514
I tip my hat to you...

1434
01:39:40,098 --> 01:39:42,559
one legend to another.

1435
01:39:44,728 --> 01:39:46,771
What was that you said?

1436
01:39:46,855 --> 01:39:51,567
"Pretty soon, no one will
believe you even existed."

1437
01:39:51,651 --> 01:39:53,778
No, Jake! No!

1438
01:40:06,541 --> 01:40:07,709
Rango!

1439
01:40:09,002 --> 01:40:12,088
You brought the water back,
just like you promised.

1440
01:40:13,131 --> 01:40:14,966
You really are a hero.

1441
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:16,008
Oh.

1442
01:40:16,092 --> 01:40:19,303
Well, the thing about heroes
is, whenever you...

1443
01:40:19,387 --> 01:40:20,805
Don't spoil it.

1444
01:40:21,181 --> 01:40:22,557
Right.

1445
01:40:22,641 --> 01:40:25,791
Well, I don't know about you all,
but I could sure go for a dip.

1446
01:40:29,564 --> 01:40:32,650
And so the lizard completes his journey

1447
01:40:32,734 --> 01:40:36,571
from humble beginnings to the
legend we sing of today.

1448
01:40:36,655 --> 01:40:39,240
And although he is certain to die,

1449
01:40:39,324 --> 01:40:41,492
perhaps from a household accident,

1450
01:40:41,576 --> 01:40:44,495
