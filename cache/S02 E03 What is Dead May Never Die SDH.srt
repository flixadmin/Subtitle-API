1
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:55,657
(Grunts)

2
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,787
Out, all of you.

3
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,959
This bastard's been meddling
where he shouldn't!

4
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,879
I want you and your men

5
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,256
gone.

6
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,135
And you will make this right.

7
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,511
(Spits)

8
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,765
Wait outside.

9
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,642
- Lord commander...
- Now!

10
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,192
(Sighs)

11
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,164
- Lord commander...
- Leave us.

12
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,876
What did you do?

13
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,253
I followed him.

14
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,173
He took the baby
into the woods, the newborn.

15
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,925
What business is that of yours?

16
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,426
No, you don't understand.

17
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,970
He's killing them, all the boys.

18
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:05,894
You know.

19
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:13,860
Wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I.

20
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,032
Those boys are craster's offerings.

21
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,409
Offerings?

22
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,619
He's murdering his own children.
He's a monster.

23
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,163
Aye, many a time
that monster has been the difference

24
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,582
between life and death for our rangers,

25
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,584
your uncle among them.

26
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,255
We have other wars to fight out there.

27
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:38,135
Like it or not, we need men like craster.

28
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,476
I saw it.

29
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,897
I saw

30
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,444
something take that child.

31
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:59,573
Yeah. Whatever it was,

32
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,242
I daresay you'll see it again.

33
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,205
Now, ready my horse.

34
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,541
We leave at dawn.

35
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,048
Don't lose it again.

36
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,225
- (Men shouting)
- (Birds squawking)

37
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,783
Gilly.

38
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,704
You're leaving.

39
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,374
I... I wanted to give you something.

40
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,798
It belonged to my mother.

41
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,802
- I can't take it.
- Please.

42
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,970
I want you to.

43
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,559
My mother used it for sewing.

44
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,730
She'd let me sit with her in her chamber
while she sewed

45
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,607
and I'd read to her.

46
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,571
My father put a stop
to it when he found out.

47
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,408
It's the only thing I have of hers.

48
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,745
She gave it to me
before I left for the wall.

49
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,373
You...

50
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,791
You shouldn't give it away.

51
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,751
I'm not giving it away.

52
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,754
I'm giving it to you.

53
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,259
Keep it safe for me.

54
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,928
Till I come back.

55
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,438
(Goats bleating)

56
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,274
(Wolf panting)

57
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,447
Hodor

58
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,199
hodor

59
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,953
rouse bran, will you?
It's time for his lessons.

60
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,309
(Gasps)

61
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,147
(Breathing heavily)

62
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,446
Bran: Every night it's the same.

63
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,157
I'm walking

64
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,618
and running, but...

65
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,497
I'm not... I'm not me.

66
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,959
I'm running through the godswood,

67
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,711
sniffing the dirt,

68
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,590
tasting blood in my mouth
when I've made a fresh kill,

69
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,217
howling.

70
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,764
Old nan used to tell me stories

71
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,807
about magical people who could live

72
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,685
inside stags, birds,

73
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,646
wolves.

74
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,564
That's exactly what they are, bran,

75
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,400
- stories.
- 80 she was lying?

76
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,737
- They don't exist?
- Well, they may have done.

77
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,490
But they're gone from the world,

78
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,575
along with much else.

79
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,872
These are dreams, bran, nothing more.

80
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,583
No, my dreams are different.

81
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,543
Mine are true.

82
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,963
I dreamt of my father dying.

83
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,966
And rickon had the same dream.

84
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,885
What about all the dreams you had
that didn't come true?

85
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,476
(Clears throat)

86
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,686
Right.

87
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,564
This link is made of valyrian steel.

88
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,860
Only one maester in
100 wears it on his chain.

89
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,323
It signifies that I have
studied the higher mysteries.

90
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:14,744
And all who study these mysteries
try their hand at spells.

91
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,746
I was no different.

92
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,498
I was young.

93
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:22,711
And what boy doesn't secretly
wish for hidden powers

94
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,923
to lift him out of his dull life
into a special one?

95
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,301
But in the end, for all my efforts,

96
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:33,680
I got no more out of it
than a thousand boys before me.

97
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,474
(Chuckles) Come on.

98
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,401
All right.

99
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,239
Maybe magic once was
a mighty force in the world.

100
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,326
But not anymore.

101
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,122
The dragons are gone.

102
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,291
The giants are dead.

103
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,463
And the children of the forest forgotten.

104
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,301
(Sighs)

105
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,974
(Men cheering)

106
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,100
(Grunting)

107
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,569
(Grunts)

108
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,987
(Men shouting)

109
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,348
Loras! Highgarden!

110
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,646
Get him!

111
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,023
(Gasps)

112
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,025
(Grunts)

113
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,276
Crowd: Oh!

114
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,739
Yield! I yield.

115
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,084
Well fought. Approach.

116
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,720
Rise. Remove your helm.

117
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,725
(Crowd murmuring)

118
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,524
You are all your father promised
and more, my lady.

119
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,818
I've seen ser loras bested once or twice,

120
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,945
but never quite in that fashion.

121
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,991
Now, now, my love.
My brother fought valiantly for you.

122
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,619
That he did, my queen.

123
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,205
But there can only be one champion.

124
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,666
Brienne of tarth,

125
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,835
you may ask anything of me you desire.

126
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,588
If it is within my power, it is yours.

127
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,550
Your grace,

128
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,553
I ask the honor of a
place in your kingsguard.

129
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,346
- (Crowd murmuring)
- What?

130
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,224
I will be one of your seven,
pledge my life to yours,

131
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,476
and keep you safe from all harm.

132
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,191
Done.

133
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,319
Rise, brienne of the kingsguard.

134
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,789
Your grace, I have
the honor to bring you lady catelyn stark,

135
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,834
sent as an envoy
by her son robb, lord of winterfell.

136
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,129
Lord of winterfell and king in the north.

137
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,382
Lady catelyn. I'm pleased to see you.

138
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,470
May I present my wife,
margaery of house Tyrell?

139
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,515
You are very welcome here, lady stark.

140
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,142
I'm so sorry for your loss.

141
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,395
You are most kind.

142
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,980
Renly: My lady,

143
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,652
I swear to you I will see the lannisters
answer for your husband's murder.

144
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,988
When I take king's landing,

145
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,157
I'll bring you Joffrey's head.

146
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,617
(Cheering)

147
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,419
It will be enough
to know thatjustice was done, my lord.

148
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,837
Brienne: Your grace.

149
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,924
And you should kneel
when you approach the king.

150
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,261
There's no need for that.
Lady stark is an honored guest.

151
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:44,514
Has your son marched against
tywin Lannister yet?

152
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,850
I do not sit on my son's war councils.

153
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,938
And if I did,
I would not share his strategies with you.

154
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:55,024
If robb stark wants a pact with us,
he should come himself,

155
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,776
not hide behind his mother's skirts.

156
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:01,864
My son is fighting a
war, not playing at one.

157
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,449
(Men grumbling)

158
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,035
(Chuckles)

159
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,213
Don't worry, my lady.

160
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,382
Our war is just beginning.

161
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,099
(Men shouting)

162
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,480
- Your grace.
- Gerard.

163
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,233
- How's your foot?
- Better, your grace.

164
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,569
They don't know their own size is all.

165
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,070
Good man.

166
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,742
I have 100,000 men at my command.

167
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,036
All the might of the stormlands
and the reach.

168
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:51,873
And all of them young and bold
like your knight of flowers?

169
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,959
It's a game to you, isn't it?

170
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,462
- I pity them.
- Why?

171
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,297
Because it won't last.

172
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,092
Because they are the knights of summer
and winter is coming.

173
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,473
Brienne, escort lady catelyn to her tent.

174
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,602
- She's tired from herjourney.
- Brienne: At once, your grace.

175
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,063
- Shall I return after?
- That won't be necessary.

176
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,648
I would pray awhile. Alone.

177
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,402
If you'll follow me, my lady.

178
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,116
You fought bravely today, lady brienne.

179
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,494
I fought for my king.

180
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,497
Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield.

181
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,457
Die for him if! Must.

182
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,544
And, if it please you, brienne's enough.

183
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,339
I'm no lady.

184
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,664
What are you doing here?

185
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,374
I live here.

186
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,585
Are you angry with me, brother?

187
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,045
You lying bitch.

188
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,756
It's not my fault you didn't recognize me.

189
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,843
Recognize you? How could I?

190
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,011
The last time I saw you...

191
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,932
You looked like a fat little boy.

192
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,310
You were a fat little boy, too,

193
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,521
but I recognized you.

194
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,356
Why didn't you tell me?

195
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,442
I wanted to see who you were first.

196
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,235
(Laughs) And I did.

197
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,657
The plans are made.
It's time you heard them.

198
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,659
- Father.
- Father.

199
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,456
The wolf pup has gone south

200
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:59,625
with the entirety
of the northern army at his back.

201
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,462
While he's tangling with
the lion in the westerlands,

202
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,964
the north is ripe for the taking.

203
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,676
The ironborn will reave and pillage,
as it was in the old days,

204
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,053
all along the northern coast.

205
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,973
We'll spread our dominion
across the green lands,

206
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,851
securing the neck and everything above.

207
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,729
Every stronghold will yield to us,
one by one.

208
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,648
Winterfell may defy us for a year,
but what of it?

209
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,442
The rest shall be ours,

210
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,528
forest, field, and hall.

211
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,994
Yara, my daughter, you'll take 30 longships

212
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,871
to attack deepwood motte.

213
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,123
I've always wanted a castle.

214
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,501
And what's my role in all this?

215
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,881
You'll take a ship to raid
the fishing villages on the stoney shore.

216
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,174
A ship?

217
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,718
You give her 30 and I get one?

218
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:54,096
The sea bitch.
We thought she'd be perfect for you.

219
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,059
I'm to fight fishermen?

220
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,186
Be careful of their nets.

221
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:07,360
Father, I fought with robb stark.
I know his men.

222
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,756
- He won't give up the north so easily.
- They won't even know we're there

223
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,591
- until it's too late.
- What do you know of it, woman?

224
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:13,991
I'm a proven warrior.

225
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:17,411
Your brothers were warriors,
both of them dead

226
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,915
at the hands of those
you seem so eager to protect.

227
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,752
I'm not protecting anyone.

228
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,837
I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait.

229
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:30,383
Why risk going against the north
if they would be our allies?

230
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,261
Rise up against them
and they could destroy us.

231
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,763
But if we pledge fealty to them,

232
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,682
they'll give us casterly rock.

233
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,517
What are our words?

234
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,603
Our words?

235
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,234
- We do not sow.
- We do not sow.

236
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,902
We are ironborn.

237
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,613
We're not subjects. We're not slaves.

238
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,741
We do not plow the
fields or toil in the mine.

239
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,827
We take what is ours.

240
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,164
Your time with the wolves
has made you weak.

241
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,713
You act as if I volunteered to go.

242
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,091
You gave me away, if you remember.

243
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,510
The day you bent the knee
to Robert Baratheon.

244
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,596
After he crushed you.

245
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,472
Did you take what was yours then?

246
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,103
You gave me away!

247
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,689
Your boy!

248
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,066
Your last boy!

249
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:33,696
You gave me away like I was
some dog you didn't want anymore.

250
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,907
And now you curse me
because I've come home.

251
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:50,463
You'd have our father
bow down to your other family?

252
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,882
I have no other family.

253
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,342
Don't you?

254
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,804
Make your choice, theon, and do it quickly.

255
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,390
Our ships sail with or without you.

256
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,154
You won't let me leave this room.

257
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,074
- You won't let me...
- (Shushing) Keep your voice down.

258
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,746
Why? You think your father can hear me?

259
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,624
(Shouting) He's 300 miles away!

260
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,084
(Sighs)

261
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,837
I don't intend for you to stay here.

262
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,216
I might be able to bring you into
the castle kitchens.

263
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,718
Again, only temporary.

264
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:43,265
Every man who has tasted my cooking
has told me what a good whore I am.

265
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,309
But you wouldn't be a cook.

266
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,187
You'd pose as a scullion.

267
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,108
Scullion? What is a scullion?

268
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,777
Kitchen wench.

269
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,738
- A kitchen wench?
- Yes, but...

270
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:01,951
Cleaning pots?
Is that how my lion wants to see me?

271
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,578
Your lion wants to see you alive.

272
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,872
We've come to a dangerous place.

273
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,833
My sister wants to hurt me.

274
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,876
She'll look for any weakness she can find.

275
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,962
She can't know about you.

276
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,172
I'm the weakness?

277
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,757
It's a compliment, my lady.

278
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,052
How is being a weakness a compliment?

279
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,307
Language can be a bit tricky here.

280
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,894
I'm too stupid to understand.

281
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,105
The stupid foreign girl.

282
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,819
I am not a kitchen wench.

283
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,680
When will Joffrey and sansa be married?

284
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,932
Soon, darling, when the war is over.

285
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,810
Mother says I'll have
a new gown for the ceremony

286
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,854
and another for the feast.

287
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:15,357
But yours will be ivory,
since you're the bride.

288
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,947
The Princess just spoke to you.

289
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,616
Pardon, your grace.

290
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,829
I'm sure your dress will
be beautiful, myrcella.

291
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,082
I'm counting the days
until the fighting is done

292
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,711
and I can pledge
my love to the king in sight of the gods.

293
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,384
Is Joffrey going to kill sansa's brother?

294
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,764
He might.

295
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,101
Would you like that?

296
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,855
No. I don't think so.

297
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,985
Even if he does, sansa will do her duty.

298
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,989
Won't you, little dove?

299
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,882
- (Knocking on door)
- (Gasps)

300
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,093
Come in.

301
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,014
Who are you?

302
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,809
I'm shae, my lady. Your new handmaiden.

303
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,479
I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden.

304
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,191
- You're not from here.
- No.

305
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,408
What are you doing?

306
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,201
Waiting for you to tell me what to do.

307
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:53,372
I shouldn't have to tell you to do things.
You should just do them.

308
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,541
What things?

309
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,210
Change my linens, wash my clothing,

310
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,547
scrub the floor,
empty my chamber pot, brush my hair.

311
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,391
- No.
- You said to brush...

312
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,976
Not now.

313
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,148
Your chamber pot is empty.

314
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,817
Clean the table.

315
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:29,575
Have you ever been a handmaiden before?

316
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,327
- Yes.
- For whom?

317
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,329
- Lady zuriff.
- Lady zu riff?

318
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,374
Lady zuriff.

319
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,753
There is no lady zuriff in this city.

320
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,213
She wasn't in this city.

321
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,549
I don't know how they
did things in that city,

322
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,385
but in this city,
handmaidens wait on ladies,

323
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,012
not the other way around.

324
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,932
And I don't have time
to answer a thousand questions

325
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,351
and teach you how to do your job.

326
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,147
Do you want me to leave?

327
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,074
Just brush my hair.

328
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,631
Tyrion: Oh!

329
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,383
Thank the gods.

330
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,635
I haven't had a proper shit in six days.

331
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,638
I've encountered
this problem before, my lord.

332
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,432
The stresses of power often have this

333
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,352
insalubrious effect.

334
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,063
Two drops with water, daily.

335
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,357
Right. I'm so grateful to have a man

336
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,318
of your vast knowledge
and wisdom on my side.

337
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,904
- Please.
- Thank you, my lord.

338
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,911
I can trust you, pycelle, can I not?

339
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,705
Why, yes, of course, my lord.

340
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,999
These are perilous times.

341
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,084
And the crown must forge new alliances.

342
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,588
And these alliances
must often be sealed in matrimony.

343
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,591
Matrimony, huh?

344
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,427
Yes.

345
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:15,639
I'm trusting the council with these plans,
but the queen mustn't know.

346
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,183
We can't have her meddling in affairs

347
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:21,107
that could determine the future of
the realm. There's too much at stake.

348
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,772
Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes.

349
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,442
I shall be silent as the grave.

350
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:31,071
I'm brokering an alliance
with house martell of dorne.

351
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:35,200
Princess myrcella will wed their
youngest son when she comes of age,

352
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:36,785
ensuring their loyalty

353
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,288
and their army, should we need it.

354
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,958
Myrcella sent away to dorne?

355
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:48,005
But remember, the queen mustn't know.

356
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,090
Ooh.

357
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,092
"The queen mustn't know."

358
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,429
I love conversations that begin this way.

359
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,974
I plan to marry Princess myrcella off

360
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,684
to theon greyjoy.

361
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,854
Theon greyjoy?

362
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:07,399
Forgive me, my lord, but how?

363
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:10,027
He grew up a ward of winterfell.

364
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,946
- He fights for robb stark.
- Precisely.

365
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:17,993
Theon's father loathes the starks and
will convince the boy to come to our side.

366
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,580
Greyjoy can destroy
the northern army from within

367
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,041
and we can have his father's ships.

368
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,877
But remember, you must tell no one.

369
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,130
Tel! No one what?

370
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:33,967
I plan to wed Princess myrcella
to Robin arryn of the vale.

371
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,514
Lysa is not fond of me.

372
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:44,561
But perhaps the promise of a royal match
will convince her to let bygones be bygones.

373
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:48,899
She imprisoned you.
She tried to execute you.

374
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,401
And you offer her son a Princess?

375
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,739
For men in our position,
holding grudges can be

376
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,533
an encumbrance, don't you think?

377
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,787
And I suppose you want me
to broker this agreement?

378
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,330
Who better?

379
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:11,713
Yes, I could sing this song to lysa,
if I cared to.

380
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:14,424
What's in it for me?

381
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:20,472
The gratitude of the people of Westeros
for helping to end this war,

382
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:24,810
the adoration of the king
for bringing the vale back into the fold...

383
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:27,813
And harrenhal.

384
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,065
Harrenhal is cursed.

385
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,734
Never took you for a superstitious man.

386
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:36,488
By all means, tear it down and rebuild.
You'll be able to afford it.

387
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:39,408
I plan to make you lord of the riverlands.

388
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,180
With a single stroke, you'd make me
one of the greatest lords in the realm.

389
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:47,332
You served my family well
in the matter of the succession.

390
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,460
So did janos slynt,
and he was given harrenhal, too.

391
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,588
Until you snatched it away.

392
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,757
I need you to deliver lysa arryn.

393
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,885
I didn't need janos slynt.

394
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,681
It's settled, then?

395
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,101
Good.

396
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,147
Oh. And remember...

397
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,232
The queen mustn't know.

398
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,121
(Breathing heavily)

399
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,898
That must hurt.

400
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:54,816
(Groans)

401
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,743
What?

402
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,330
What is it?

403
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,123
(Scoffs)

404
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:12,334
A member of the kingsguard?

405
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,171
As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.

406
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,839
(Sighs)

407
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:21,927
Brienne is a very capable warrior.

408
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,847
And she's devoted to me.

409
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,226
You're jealous.

410
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,354
Jealous?

411
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,398
Of brienne the beauty?

412
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,858
Don't make me laugh.

413
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,738
- I'll make it up to you.
- No, your grace.

414
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,032
Not tonight.

415
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,203
There's another Tyrell
who requires your attention.

416
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:52,332
You didn't win my father's support
or his army on charm alone.

417
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:09,057
Your vassals are starting
to snigger behind your back.

418
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,269
Brides aren't usually virgins
two weeks after their wedding night.

419
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,313
(Scoffs) And margaery's a virgin?

420
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,315
Officially.

421
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,985
Shall I bring her to you?

422
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,640
I should warn you,
I've had quite a bit of wine.

423
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,934
As is your right. You are a king.

424
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,356
You look very beautiful.

425
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,191
Thank you, your grace.

426
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,527
- It's a lovely gown.
- You think so?

427
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,822
I can't decide how I like it better.

428
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:07,157
This way,

429
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:10,619
or this way.

430
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,794
You certainly don't need it.

431
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:25,342
Although, some say the beauty most desired

432
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,386
is the beauty concealed.

433
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,196
Must be the wine.

434
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,115
Here, let me.

435
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:05,090
(Shudders)

436
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,594
I'm sorry.

437
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,557
Do you want my brother to come in and help?

438
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,228
- What?
- He could get you started.

439
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,563
I know he wouldn't mind.

440
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,107
Or I can turn over
and you can pretend I'm him.

441
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,778
I don't know what you're talking about.

442
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,995
There's no need for us to play games.

443
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,623
Save your lies for court.
You're going to need a lot of them.

444
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:02,147
Your enemies aren't happy about us.
They want to tear us apart.

445
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,483
And the best way to stop them

446
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,277
is to put your baby

447
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,071
in my belly.

448
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,785
We can try again later.

449
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:20,081
You decide how you want to do it,
with me, with me and loras,

450
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,042
however else you like.

451
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,380
Whatever you need to do.

452
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,052
You are a king.

453
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,104
Cersei: You monster.

454
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,024
Myrcella is my only daughter.

455
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,735
Do you really think
I'll let you sell her like a common whore?

456
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,947
Myrcella's a Princess.
Some would say she was born for this.

457
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,784
I will not let you ship her off to dorne
as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.

458
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,036
Dorne is the safest place for her.

459
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,122
Are you mad? The martells loathe us.

460
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,000
That's why we need to seduce them.

461
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:07,587
We're going to need their
support in the war your son started.

462
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:09,965
- She'll be a hostage.
- A guest.

463
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:13,134
You won't get away with this.

464
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:16,471
You think the piece of paper
father gave you keeps you safe.

465
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,518
Ned stark had a piece of paper, too.

466
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,356
- It's done, Cersei.
- No.

467
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:29,859
- You cannot stop it.
- No!

468
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:36,366
Just how safe do you think myrcella is
if this city falls?

469
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:40,370
Do you want to see her raped,
butchered like the Targaryen children?

470
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,122
Make no mistake.

471
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,845
They'll mount her pretty little
head on a spike right beside yours.

472
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,835
Get out! Get out!

473
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:52,150
Theon of the house greyjoy,

474
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,320
you would this day
consecrate your faith to the drowned god?

475
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,122
- I would.
- Kneel.

476
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,002
Let theon, your servant,

477
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,838
be born again from the sea as you were.

478
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:16,633
Bless him with salt.

479
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,346
Bless him with stone.

480
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:23,807
Bless him with steel.

481
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,272
What is dead may never die.

482
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,441
What is dead may never die.

483
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,238
But rises again harder and stronger.

484
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:40,740
Stand.

485
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,470
(Dog barking)

486
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,977
(Footsteps approaching)

487
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,605
I don't appreciate
being made a fool of, dwarf.

488
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,442
If myrcella marries the martell boy,

489
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,986
she can't very well
marry Robin arryn, can she?

490
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,072
No, afraid not. Sorry about that.

491
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,449
And harrenhal,

492
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,077
I suppose that's off the table as well.

493
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:29,706
Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too.

494
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,333
Leave me out of your next deception.

495
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,127
That's a shame.

496
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,755
You were to be
the centerpiece of my next deception.

497
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:40,425
My brother Jaime rots
in a northern stockade.

498
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:44,345
I would see him released.
That's where you come in.

499
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,890
Robb stark will never
release the kingslayer.

500
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,934
No, he won't. But his mother might.

501
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,730
How would you like to see
your beloved cat again?

502
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,857
(Footsteps approaching)

503
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,194
- Find him?
- Oh, aye.

504
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,196
And he has company.

505
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,533
Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt.

506
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,035
No, you don't.

507
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:08,912
No, I don't.

508
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,328
- (Door slams open)
- (Gasps)

509
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,505
What is the meaning of this?

510
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,799
No, please, please.

511
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:23,009
You disappoint me, grand maester.

512
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,303
I am your loyal servant.

513
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:29,140
So loyal that you told the queen
about my plans to send myrcella to dorne.

514
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:31,059
No! Never!

515
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,436
It's a falsehood. I swear it.

516
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,104
It wasn't me.

517
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,357
Ah, varys.

518
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,151
It was varys the spider.

519
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:44,322
See, I told varys that
I was giving the Princess to the greyjoys.

520
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:48,785
I told littlefinger
that I planned to wed her to Robin arryn.

521
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,163
I told no one
that I was offering her to the dornish.

522
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,958
No one but you.

523
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,502
The eunuch has spies everywhere.

524
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,629
Cut off his manhood
and feed it to the goats.

525
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,465
- No, no, no.
- There are no goats, halfman.

526
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:03,842
Well, make do.

527
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,385
(Pycelle whimpering)

528
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,805
How long have you
been spying for my sister?

529
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,724
All I did, I did for house Lannister.

530
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:14,060
Always. Your lord father, ask him.

531
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:17,647
I've always been his servant
since the days of the mad king.

532
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,776
- I don't like his beard.
- What?

533
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:24,904
What? No. No.

534
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,448
(Whimpering)

535
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,910
How many hands have you betrayed, pycelle?

536
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,037
Eddard stark? Jon arryn?

537
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,039
Lord arryn, he knew.

538
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:37,792
(Stammering)
He knew the truth about the queen.

539
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:43,256
And... he planned to
act, to tell king Robert.

540
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,632
So you poisoned him?

541
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,051
No. Never.

542
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:49,846
But you let him die,
made sure he succumbed.

543
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,557
Lannister... I always served Lannister.

544
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,310
Get him out of my sight.
Throw him in one of the black cells.

545
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,103
No. No, no, no. No, please.

546
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,147
Don't! You can't do this to me!

547
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:01,983
For your trouble.

548
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,777
(Pycelle shouting)

549
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:29,052
You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend

550
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:32,013
is doing quite well in
lady sansa's service.

551
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,808
Good. One of my better ideas.

552
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:40,188
And it seems the grand maester
has found his way into a black cell?

553
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,859
Well played, my lord hand.

554
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,613
But should I be worried?

555
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,657
Janos slynt, pycelle...

556
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,534
The small council grows smaller every day.

557
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:57,038
The council has a reputation
for serving past hands poorly.

558
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,791
I don't mean to follow
ned stark to the grave.

559
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,503
Power is a curious thing, my lord.

560
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,589
Are you fond of riddles?

561
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:08,675
Why, am I about to hear one?

562
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,969
Three great men sit in a room.

563
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,846
A king, a priest and a rich man.

564
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,641
Between them stands a common sellsword.

565
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:20,436
Each great man
bids the sellsword kill the other two.

566
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,231
Who lives, who dies?

567
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,608
Depends on the sellsword.

568
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:29,988
Does it? He has neither crown
nor gold nor favor with the gods.

569
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:32,240
He has a sword, the
power of life and death.

570
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:36,995
But if it's swordsmen who rule,
why do we pretend kings hold all the power?

571
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:41,874
When ned stark lost his head,
who was truly responsible?

572
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,337
Joffrey? The executioner?
Or something else?

573
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,631
I've decided I don't like riddles.

574
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:55,346
Power resides where men believe it resides.

575
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,976
It's a trick, a shadow on the wall.

576
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:06,983
And a very small man
can cast a very large shadow.

577
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,826
(Horse whinnies)

578
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,121
(Snoring)

579
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:31,549
(Door opens)

580
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:49,275
You should be sleeping.

581
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,487
Tomorrow's a long march.

582
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,823
Thirty miles, if it don't piss on us.

583
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:58,701
I can't sleep.

584
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,500
I don't like the taste.

585
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:07,418
(Chuckles)

586
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:09,754
(Grunts)

587
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:14,675
You don't drink it for
the flavor, to be honest.

588
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,060
What?

589
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:27,063
How do you sleep?

590
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:29,565
Same as most men, I think.

591
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,360
But you've seen things,

592
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,404
horrible things.

593
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,536
I've seen some pretty things, too,

594
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,538
but not nearly so many.

595
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:47,542
How do you sleep when you...

596
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:53,214
When you have those things in your head?

597
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,468
You didn't see that.

598
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,221
I made damn sure.

599
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,431
I close my eyes and I see them up there.

600
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,560
All of them

601
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,979
standing there.

602
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,606
Joffrey,

603
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:15,278
the queen and...

604
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,573
And my sister.

605
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,669
You know, we've got
something in common, me and you.

606
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,171
You know that?

607
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:35,965
I must have been

608
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,427
a couple of years older than you.

609
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,598
I saw my brother stabbed through the heart

610
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,975
right on our doorstep.

611
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:49,103
He weren't much of a villain
what skewered him.

612
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,689
Willem, the lad's name was.

613
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:56,152
He ran off before anyone could spit.

614
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,238
And I just stood there,

615
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:02,325
watching my brother die.

616
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,120
Here's the funny part.

617
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,957
I can't picture my brother's face anymore.

618
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,335
But willem,

619
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,004
oh, he was a nice-looking boy.

620
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,968
He had good white teeth, blue eyes,

621
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:25,348
one of those dimpled
chins all the girls like.

622
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:31,020
I would think about him when I was working,

623
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:34,148
when I was drinking,
when I was having a shit.

624
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,026
It got to the point

625
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:40,613
where I would say his name every night
before I went to bed.

626
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,531
Willem. Willem.

627
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,575
Willem.

628
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,703
A prayer almost.

629
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,499
Well, one day,

630
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,337
willem came riding back into town.

631
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:05,805
I buried an ax so deep into willem's skull
they had to Bury him with it.

632
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:13,854
Willem's horse got me to the wall
and I've been wearing black ever since.

633
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,488
That'll help you sleep, eh? (Chuckles)

634
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,910
- (Horn sounds)
- (Men shouting)

635
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,541
Get up, you lazy sons ofwhores!

636
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,293
Arm yourselves.

637
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,087
Gendry: Get up. Arya: Get up.

638
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,172
Keep out of sight, both of you.

639
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:41,650
- No, I'm not afraid.
- I can fight.

640
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:43,301
Keep out of sight.

641
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,554
If things go wrong, you run.

642
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:50,558
Do you hear me?
You run along north and don't look back.

643
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:55,396
Hey, there's men out there
who want to fuck your corpses.

644
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,690
Outside, now!

645
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,402
Man: Come on, move, move!

646
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:03,195
(Horse whinnies)

647
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:04,739
Gold cloaks!

648
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:08,909
(Shouting)

649
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:11,996
Everyone out!

650
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:13,789
(Shouting)

651
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:20,087
Hey, you! Open the damn cage!

652
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,468
Where's the bastard, crow?

653
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:28,012
Got more than a few bastards here.
Who's asking?

654
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:31,182
Ser amory lorch,
sworn bannerman to lord tywin Lannister.

655
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:34,643
These men from the capital
requested our assistance.

656
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:37,438
Drop your weapons in the name of the king.

657
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,357
Now, which king would that be?

658
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,442
This is your last chance.

659
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:46,238
In the name of king Joffrey,
drop your weapons.

660
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:51,577
I don't think I will.

661
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,287
So be it.

662
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:54,955
(Grunts)

663
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:00,127
I always hated crossbows.
Take too long to load.

664
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:19,271
(Groans)

665
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:27,196
(Gurgles)

666
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,376
Jaqen: Boy, come here. Boy!

667
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,879
- Sweet boy, help us.
- Come back here!

668
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:45,089
Help us, boy!

669
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,508
(Shouting)

670
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,554
A man can fight! Free us!

671
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:00,521
Quick, give it to me.

672
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,524
Give me the ax. Give me that.

673
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,952
Man: Put them on the wagon!

674
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,329
There's more here. Come on.

675
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:18,497
(Grunts)

676
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:19,874
(Panting)

677
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,375
(Chuckles)

678
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,670
What do we have here?

679
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:30,384
That's a fine little blade.

680
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:33,637
Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.

681
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,389
I yield! I yield!

682
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:37,683
Amory: Round up any survivors.

683
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,894
We'll take them back to harrenhal.

684
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,605
You heard him. You're coming with us.

685
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,024
I yield!

686
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,069
(Whimpering)

687
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:51,780
Help!

688
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:53,282
Help me!

689
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,246
Something wrong with your leg, boy?

690
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,081
Look at it.

691
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,674
Can you walk?

692
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,968
No. You got to carry me.

693
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:15,846
All right.

694
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:25,189
(Coughing)

695
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,321
"Carry him," he says. (Laughs)

696
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,624
We're looking for a bastard named gendry.

697
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,918
Give him up

698
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:48,712
or I'll start taking eyeballs.

699
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:02,810
You want gendry?

700
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,649
You already got him.

701
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:14,697
He loved that helmet.
