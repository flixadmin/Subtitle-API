Life's not fair...
is it, my little friend?

29
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,392
While some are born to feast...

30
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,466
others spend their lives
in the dark.

31
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,467
Begging for scraps.

32
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,441
The way I see it...

33
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:23,680
you and I are exactly the same.

34
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,515
We both want to find a way out.

35
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,183
The king approaches!

36
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,785
This is not a drill.

37
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,553
His Majesty has requested
an audience.

38
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:37,190
Upon his entrance,
you will rise and genuflect.

39
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,997
Zazu...

40
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,993
you've made me lose my lunch.

41
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:44,130
You will answer to Mufasa

42
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,565
for missing the ceremony
this morning.

43
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,203
I answer to no one.

44
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:52,138
Scar? Scar. Scar.

45
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,341
No, no.
Don't look at me like that.

46
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,877
Are you hungry. Zazu?

47
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,014
Perhaps we could have
a bite together!

48
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,082
You can't eat me!

49
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:05,485
It is forbidden to eat
a member of the king's oourt!

50
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,088
0w! No, please! Stop it!

51
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,328
Scar!

52
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,493
Well, look who's come down
to mingle with the commoners.

53
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,764
Sarabi and I didn't see you
at the presentation of Simba.

54
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,069
Was that today?

55
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,106
Must've slipped my mind.

56
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,711
Of course I meant no disrespect

57
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:35,418
towards His Majesty or Sarabi.

58
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:42,722
As you know. I have tremendous
respect for the queen.

59
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,691
As the king's brother,

60
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,559
you should've been
first in line.

61
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,457
I was first in line.

62
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,797
Or don't you remember?

63
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:55,068
That is, until the precious
prince arrived.

64
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:58,238
Don't turn your back on me,
Scar.

65
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:59,572
Oh, no. Mufasa.

66
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,278
Perhaps you shouldn't
turn your back on me.

67
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,779
Is that a challenge?

68
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:10,453
I wouldn't dream
of challenging you again.

69
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,285
A wise decision.

70
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,721
You are no match
for His Royalness.

71
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:18,258
Well, as far as brains go,
I got the lion's share.

72
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,760
But when it comes
to brute strength,

73
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,159
I'm afraid my big brother...

74
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,831
will always rule.

75
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,300
Not always, Scar.

76
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,737
One day.
It'll be my son who rules.

77
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:33,170
Simba will be your king.

78
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,414
Then long live the king.

79
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,648
- What am I gonna do with him?
- Oh, come on.

80
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,849
We both know he should've been

81
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,452
expelled from the Pride Lands
long ago.

82
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:48,521
He's my brother, Zazu.
This is his home.

83
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:52,325
As long as I am king,
that will never change.

84
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,160
Well, there's one
in every family, sire.

85
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,596
I had a cousin who thought
he was a woodpecker.

86
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,499
He slammed his head into trees.

87
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,767
And our beaks
aren't built for it.

88
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:03,770
He was concussed regularly.
Oh, you've gone.

89
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,135
Sire, coming back!

90
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,576
Simba.

91
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:04,387
Dad. You awake?

92
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,597
Dad. Wake up!

93
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,732
Dad!

94
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,566
Dad. Dad. Dad!

95
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,436
Your son's awake.

96
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,937
Before sunrise, he's your son.

97
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,773
Come on, Dad, let's go.

98
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,442
You said I could
patrol with you today.

99
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:23,776
And today has started.

100
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:26,744
You promised! You up?

101
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,525
Let's do this!

102
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:41,494
- Let's do this.
- So. What's first?

103
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,928
Give orders for the hunt?
Chase away evil intruders?

104
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:49,675
Dad! You're going the wrong way!

105
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,879
Dad?

106
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,619
I'm not supposed to go up here.

107
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,381
Look. Simba.

108
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:10,356
Everything the light touches
is our kingdom.

109
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,959
You rule all of that?

110
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,561
Yes.

111
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:17,130
But a king's time as ruler...

112
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,200
rises and falls like the sun.

113
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,968
One day, Simba...

114
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:25,138
the sun will set
on my time here...

115
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:28,038
and will rise with you
as the new king.

116
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:33,080
All of this will belong to me?

117
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:37,684
It belongs to no one,
but will be yours to protect.

118
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,992
A great responsibility.

119
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,322
Everything the light touches?

120
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:46,159
Those trees?
And the watering hole?

121
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:48,027
And that mountain?

122
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,496
And beyond those shadows?

123
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,665
You must not go there, Simba.

124
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,034
But I thought a king could do
whatever he wants.

125
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,602
Take any territory.

126
00:12:57,243 --> 00:13:00,573
While others search
for what they can take...

127
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,746
a true king
searches for what he can give.

128
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,352
Everything you see
exists together

129
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,557
in a delicate balance.

130
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:18,858
As king, you need to
understand that balance...

131
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,127
and respect all the creatures...

132
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,129
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope.

133
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,368
But. Dad.
Don't we eat the antelope?

134
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:32,105
Yes, Simba. But let me explain.

135
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:36,476
When we die,
our bodies become the grass...

136
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:39,579
and the antelope
eat the grass...

137
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:44,322
and so we are all connected
in the great circle of life.

138
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,886
- Sire!
- Morning, Zazu.

139
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,554
Do you have the morning report?

140
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,156
Yes, sire.

141
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,425
Ten flamingos
are taking a stand.

142
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:53,993
Two giraffe were caught necking.

143
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,329
The buzz from the bees is that the
leopards are in a bit of a spot.

144
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:57,430
Ready for some fun?

145
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,299
The birds are tweeting
at 4:00 in the morning.

146
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,067
I'm like, "Birds, we get it."

147
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,669
Stay low to the ground.

148
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:03,770
I got this.

149
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,977
Check the wind, the shadows...

150
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,660
and wait for
the perfect moment to pounce.

151
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,178
The cheetahs stole the baboons' dinner,
and now the baboons are going ape.

152
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,447
Of course. As I say,
cheetahs never prosper.

153
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:15,581
That's what I say.

154
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:16,749
Do you get... I'll say it again.

155
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,649
Cheetahs never...

156
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,091
Come on! It's the news!

157
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,929
That's very good!

158
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,936
Sire!

159
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,500
Sire! Hyenas in the Pride Lands.

160
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,702
They're on the hunt!

161
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,671
- Where's Sarabi?
- She's leading the charge.

162
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,173
Zazu. Take Simba home.

163
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,174
Dad, let me come! I can help.

164
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:45,846
No, son.
You stay with the other cubs.

165
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,347
I am nota cub.

166
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,121
Come on.

167
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,992
Let's go home.

168
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:06,866
Here we are.

169
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,698
Now you go along
and play with the other cubs.

170
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,644
Great.

171
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,426
If you wish to kill something...

172
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,734
you might want to stay downwind.

173
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,763
I know how to hunt, Uncle Scar.

174
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,033
Well, let's hope we're never
attacked by a beetle.

175
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,937
Go back to your den. Simba.
I don't babysit.

176
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,041
Babysit? I'm gonna be the king
of Pride Rock.

177
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,077
My dad showed me
the whole kingdom.

178
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,280
Said I'm going to rule it all.

179
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,048
Is that so?

180
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,249
Think about it.

181
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,386
When I'm king,
I'll have to give you orders.

182
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,288
Tell you what to do.

183
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,459
How weird is that?

184
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,656
You've no idea.

185
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,461
So, your dad showed you
the whole kingdom?

186
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,235
Did he show you the shadows
beyond the northern borders?

187
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:53,473
No. He said I can't go there.
Ever.

188
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:57,613
And he's absolutely right.

189
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:02,615
An elephant graveyard is
no place for a young prince.

190
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:06,652
An elephant graveyard?

191
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,689
Oh. Dear. I've said too much.

192
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,757
Though I suppose you'd have
found out sooner or later...

193
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,660
you being king and all.

194
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,162
You've been there?

195
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:19,665
We've all been there.
And it's no place for a cub.

196
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,168
All those rotting bones...

197
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,438
and burning pools of oozing mud.

198
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,773
Rotting bones? Oozing mud?

199
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:31,210
Promise me
you'll stay away, Simba.

200
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,142
Now, you run along.

201
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,653
And remember...

202
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:43,020
it's our little secret...

203
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,292
Your Majesty.

204
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,701
Nala! Come on. We have to go.

205
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,570
- Where?
- Watering hole.

206
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,739
Simba, she's having her bath.

207
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,741
And it's time for yours.

208
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,241
But. Mom...

209
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:05,077
I can do it myself.

210
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,512
Hold still.

211
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,347
You're messing up my mane!

212
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,383
Come on. Behind the ears.

213
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,486
Come on, Mom!

214
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,690
See? All clean. Can we go?

215
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,522
There's no hyenas.
You just chased them all off.

216
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,593
Just to the watering hole
and no further.

217
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,668
And stay downwind.

218
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,703
And one more little thing.

219
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,672
Zazu will be going with you.

220
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:33,773
Zazu?

221
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:36,772
Zazu goes... or you don't.

222
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,883
Come along. Keep up.
Let's move in a unit.

223
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,551
Okay, buddy system.

224
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,386
So, where are we really going?

225
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,554
How did you know?

226
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:49,722
You hate the water.

227
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,958
I heard about this place, Nala.

228
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,693
The most incredible, amazing...

229
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,561
Just tell me where.

230
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:58,631
An elephant graveyard.

231
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,800
How far is it?

232
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,802
Not far. Just to the shadows.

233
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,870
But don't worry,
everyone's been there.

234
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,372
We've never been
that far before.

235
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:08,407
- What if we get lost?
- Relax, Nala.

236
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:12,044
I patrolled the entire kingdom
this morning with my dad.

237
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,646
There's nothing to worry about.

238
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,886
Well, there is one thing.

239
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,318
We have an imminent threat.
Something is approaching.

240
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,554
Oh. Wait. Scratch that.
That's my own shadow.

241
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,456
How we getting rid of the dude?

242
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,257
Trust me, I got this.

243
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,928
Follow me to freedom.

244
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,062
Oh, how lovely it is...

245
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:33,432
to see the future king
with his future queen.

246
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,334
I could just molt.

247
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,136
What do you mean,
"future queen"?

248
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,139
Well, one day the two of you
will be betrothed.

249
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,277
Intended. Affianced.

250
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,311
Simba, you speak bird?

251
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,579
Married!

252
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,183
Come on.
One day you will be married.

253
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,121
To each other.

254
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,584
Ew!

255
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,288
That's not
gonna happen, Zazu.

256
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:57,356
Never ever.

257
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,758
Nala and I are friends.

258
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:01,027
And besides,
she's afraid of rhinos!

259
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,161
And he's never eaten an impala.

260
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,295
I've tried it once.

261
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,864
We are never
getting married, Zazu.

262
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,966
A monarch who ignores tradition?

263
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,634
With an attitude like that.

264
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:11,103
I'm afraid you'll be
a pretty pathetic king.

265
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,539
Well, I'm not letting anyone
tell me where to go.

266
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,108
What to do...
and even who to marry.

267
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,110
There will never be a king
like me.

268
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,447
Simba, you can't escape
your destiny.

269
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:23,311
Just watch.

270
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,317
I'm gonna be a mighty king.

271
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,522
So enemies beware.

272
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:30,389
Well, I've
never seen a king of beasts.

273
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,697
With quite so little hair.

274
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:37,635
I'm gonna be the main event
Like no king was before.

275
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,366
I'm brushing up on looking down.

276
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,234
Working on my roar.

277
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:45,907
Thus far
a rather uninspiring thing.

278
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:50,676
Oh, I just can't wait
to be king.

279
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,978
You have rather a long way
to go, young master.

280
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,581
If you think...
No one saying "do this".

281
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:56,916
Now, when I said that...

282
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,350
No one saying "be there".

283
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,518
What I meant was...

284
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,587
No one saying "stop that".

285
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,322
No one saying "see here".

286
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:04,657
Now see here!

287
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:07,827
Free to run around all day.

288
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,361
Well, that's definitely out.

289
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:13,159
Free to do it all my way.

290
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:19,038
I think it's time that you and I.

291
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:21,175
Arranged a heart-to-heart.

292
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,275
Kings don't need advice.

293
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:26,175
From little hombills for a start.

294
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:30,883
If this is where the monarchy
is headed, count me out.

295
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:33,452
Out of service Out of Africa

296
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,953
I wouldn't hang about.

297
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,558
This child is getting
wildly out of wing.

298
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:40,626
Simba!

299
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:45,062
Oh. I just can't wait to be king.

300
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,141
Simba!

301
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:57,877
I can't see you, Simba.

302
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,779
You must be in my sight
at all times.

303
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,313
I've lost him!

304
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:05,050
I know what you're doing!

305
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,952
Where are you going. Simba?

306
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,759
Come on!

307
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,758
You can't hide from me, Simba.

308
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,594
It is my sworn duty
to keep you safe.

309
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:18,402
YoU listen to me right now.

310
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,801
I'm sorry to flutter about in your face,
have you seen... He's a little lion.

311
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:26,939
He's small, but he's cute.

312
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,746
Everybody look left.

313
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:36,247
Everybody look right.

314
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,517
Everywhere you look I'm.

315
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:41,520
Standing in
the spotlight Not yet.

316
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,352
Let every creature go
for broke and sing.

317
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:49,428
Let's hear it in the bent
and on the wing.

318
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,430
I see you down there!
I see you down there!

319
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,206
It's gonna be King Simba's
finest fling.

320
00:22:55,808 --> 00:23:00,005
Oh. I just can't wait to be king.

321
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,140
Simba!

322
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:05,511
He just can't wait to be king.

323
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:11,217
Oh, I just can't
wait Just can't wait.

324
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:16,051
To be king.

325
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:17,790
I've lost him!

326
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,859
Mufasa's gonna have my feathers.

327
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,860
This is not good!

328
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,565
Simba, we really lost him.

329
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,067
I know what you're thinking.

330
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:29,535
"The future king is a genius."

331
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:30,970
You can't be serious.

332
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,472
You would've never gotten away
without your queen.

333
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,974
Aren't you forgetting something?

334
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:36,742
There is no queen.

335
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:37,910
You could say that again.

336
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,478
I'd rather marry an aardvark.

337
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,347
Good luck finding one
that will say yes.

338
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:43,048
Good luck getting out of here
without a bruising.

339
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,219
Give it your best shot.

340
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,555
Pinned ya!

341
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,490
You owe me an apology.

342
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,092
Never!

343
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:04,003
Pinned ya. Again.

344
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:05,371
Nala, stop!

345
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:06,505
What is that?

346
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,207
You're not gonna trick me,
Simba.

347
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:10,742
I know that there's nothing...

348
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:15,947
This must be it.

349
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,417
Come on!

350
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:41,140
Simba. We're way
beyond the Pride Lands.

351
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,642
We found it, Nala.
You know what this means?

352
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,210
It means we can go home.

353
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,713
It means they won't
treat us like cubs anymore.

354
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,965
Simba, get down!
It could be dangerous.

355
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,367
Danger?

356
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:44,972
I laugh in the face of danger.

357
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:48,974
Cool!

358
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,782
You hear that. Nala?

359
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:53,712
Simba. Come on!

360
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,514
You've proved how brave you are.

361
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,715
Now the sun is going down,

362
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,023
I'm not just
gonna sit here and...

363
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:23,177
Well, look at this.

364
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:27,179
We weren't
expecting guests today.

365
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:29,851
Would you two cubs...

366
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:31,817
like to stay fordinner?

367
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:33,852
Yeah, stay for dinner.

368
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:36,321
'Cause you look
like a midnight snack!

369
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,023
Can you just give me
a little bit of space?

370
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,158
I'm helping.

371
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:40,859
We have talked
about this before.

372
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,161
I come in alone.

373
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,563
I'm the lead distraction
so everyone can circle.

374
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,932
Okay, okay. Sorry.

375
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:48,734
Don't be sorry. Just do it.

376
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:52,271
Now, this is a meal
I've waited my whole life for.

377
00:26:56,982 --> 00:27:01,880
What an unexpected treat,
to eat the son of a king.

378
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,616
Wait a second, the king?
As in you-know-who?

379
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,118
Who rules you-know-where?

380
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:08,949
Mufasa does not rule me!

381
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:11,857
You can't do anything to me!

382
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:14,028
'Cause I'm the future king!

383
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,464
He's telling me what to do.

384
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:21,364
His father's strength
flickering inside.

385
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:23,741
I wonder...

386
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,434
how all that bravery will taste.

387
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,002
Let them go, Shenzi!

388
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:31,977
They made a mistake,
a horrible mistake!

389
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:36,081
But if you do this, you will
start a war with Mufasa!

390
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:39,751
Hyenas and lions have been at war
since the beginning of time.

391
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:43,088
But Mufasa's bloodline
will end here!

392
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,827
Run!

393
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:52,827
Don't let them get away!

394
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,250
Come on!

395
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,433
Did you hear that?

396
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,102
The future king!

397
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:31,603
Oh, don't hurt me!

398
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,638
Do It again!

399
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:11,176
If you ever come
near my son again...

400
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:14,508
No. Mufasa. Never.

401
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,345
Never again.

402
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:19,179
You've been warned, Shenzi.

403
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:30,766
I thought you were very brave.

404
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:07,429
Zazu?

405
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,601
Take Nala back to Pride Rock.

406
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,439
Yes, sire.

407
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,608
Don't be too hard on him, sire.

408
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:20,078
I remember a cub,
a certain headstrong cub...

409
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:22,114
who was always getting
into scrapes.

410
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:24,816
And he achieved some prominence,

411
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:26,214
did he not. Sire?

412
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,282
I have to teach my son a lesson.

413
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,790
Nala, come along.

414
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,839
Simba?

415
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:06,458
You deliberately disobeyed me.

416
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:07,759
I know.

417
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,661
You could have been killed.

418
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:13,598
And what's worse,
you put Nala in danger.

419
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:16,338
Do you understand
what's at stake?

420
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:20,772
You jeopardized
the future of our pride.

421
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:24,009
I just wanted to show you
I could do it.

422
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,144
That I could be brave like you.

423
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,380
I'm only brave
when I have to be.

424
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,482
When there's no other choice.

425
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:33,188
But you're not scared
of anything.

426
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,020
I was today.

427
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,121
You were?

428
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:40,522
Yes. I thought I might lose you.

429
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:45,327
I guess
even kings get scared?

430
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,800
More than you could ever know.

431
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,802
- But guess what?
- What?

432
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:54,639
I think those hyenas
were even scareder.

433
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:57,676
That's 'cause nobody messes
with your dad.

434
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:59,176
Come here.

435
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:12,924
Dad?

436
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,994
- We're pals, right?
- Right.

437
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,094
Right?

438
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:25,771
Simba. Let me tell you
something my father told me.

439
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:27,873
Look at the stars.

440
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:30,442
The great kings of the past...

441
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:33,612
look down on us
from those stars.

442
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:36,047
- Really?
- Yes.

443
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:38,550
So whenever you feel alone...

444
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,520
just remember
that those kings...

445
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,590
will always be up there
to guide you.

446
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:47,354
And so will I.

447
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,561
But I can't see them. Dad.

448
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:51,763
Keep looking, son.

449
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,798
Keep looking.

450
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,769
Mufasa is strong.

451
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:32,838
Like, way stronger than us.

452
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:34,573
- Please give me some space.
- What?

453
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:36,441
You could lay anywhere
in this cave.

454
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:38,743
- Where do you want me to...
- I need some personal space.

455
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:40,812
- 0kay?
- Okay.

456
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,316
Not to take anything away
from you. You were great.

457
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,917
But he is...

458
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:47,652
See. Now I know you're
doing this on purpose.

459
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,188
Very brave, too.
Tough, good energy.

460
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,323
Now you're just being spiteful.

461
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,424
Good posture.

462
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:53,792
Next time I see Mufasa...

463
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:56,528
I'm gonna teach him a lesson
he will never forget.

464
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:58,830
Well, you're in luck!
He's right behind ya.

465
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,637
Mufasa?

466
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:16,553
That's not the king.

467
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:21,686
You fools have stripped your
land of every living thing.

468
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,856
And yet I send
two little cubs your way...

469
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,686
and they come back alive.

470
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,625
I guess
we'll have to eat you instead.

471
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,163
Why eat one meal...

472
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:35,666
when you can be feasting
the rest of your lives?

473
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:39,004
What could you possibly
offer us?

474
00:34:39,044 --> 00:34:41,806
A place where you can fill
your bellies.

475
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:43,708
Where everything
the light touches

476
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,977
is yours for the kill.

477
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:48,213
The Pride Lands
are not yours to give.

478
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,919
The king controls
those hunting grounds.

479
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,766
That's why
we're going to kill him.

480
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:09,501
Mufasa has always shown
too much restraint...

481
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,934
when it comes to hunting.

482
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,506
When I am king...

483
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:17,007
the mighty will be free to
take whatever they want.

484
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:20,843
Because a hyena's belly
is never full.

485
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:23,782
Mufasa's far too powerful
to challenge.

486
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:27,114
Mufasa is yesterday's message.

487
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:31,225
A clapped-out, distracted regime.

488
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,096
Whose failings
undoubtedly presage.

489
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:39,203
The need for a dif'rent dream.

490
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:43,297
Yes, leonine times
are a-changing.

491
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:47,540
Which means that hyenas must too.

492
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:52,444
My vision is clear
and wide-ranging.

493
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:55,480
And even encompasses you.

494
00:35:56,621 --> 00:36:00,288
So prepare
for the coup of the century.

495
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:04,319
Prepare for the murkiest scam.

496
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:09,060
Meticulous planning
Tenacity spanning.

497
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,892
Decades of denial
Is simply why I'll.

498
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:17,168
Be king Undisputed
Respected Saluted.

499
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,500
And seen for the wonder! Am.

500
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:24,843
Yes, my teeth
and ambitions are bared.

501
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:27,083
Be prepared.

509
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:20,197
My dad was pretty upset with me.

510
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,336
I think I know a way for you
to make it up to him.

511
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,873
A gift that will make him
forget it ever happened.

512
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,910
But he's the king.
What could I give him?

513
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,645
Your roar.

514
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:34,813
My roar?

515
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:36,518
Yes!

516
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,080
Did you hear that?

517
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:43,922
This gorge is where all lions
come to find their roar.

518
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:45,262
All lions?

519
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,060
Even my dad?

520
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:50,228
Even Mufasa came here
when he was your age.

521
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,830
Refused to leave...

522
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:56,038
until his roar could be heard
above the rim.

523
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:58,069
All the way up there?

524
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,105
That's when you know
you've found it.

525
00:38:00,145 --> 00:38:02,040
With a little practice...

526
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,213
you'll never be called
a cub again.

527
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,544
Watch this.

528
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,516
You'll get it, Simba.

529
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:13,852
Just takes time.

530
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:15,853
I'll check on you later.

531
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:19,224
Dad will be so proud, won't he?

532
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:22,192
It's a gift he'll never forget.

533
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:08,900
Mufasa! Quick!

534
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,802
Stampede in the gorge!

535
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,136
Simba's down there!

536
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:13,704
Simba?

537
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:15,877
I'll find him.

538
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,074
Zazu!

539
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:46,910
Hold on! Help is coming!

540
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:56,384
There he is! On that tree!

541
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:02,252
I'm coming, Simba! Hold on!

542
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:10,194
I'll help them, Zazu!
You get the pride!

543
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:11,728
Go!

544
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:38,553
Dad!

545
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:40,555
Simba!

546
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,994
Come to me, son.

547
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,661
Jump!

548
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:06,285
Dad!

549
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:02,873
Scar!

550
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,047
Help me.

551
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:18,393
Long live the king!

552
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:27,334
No!

553
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,048
Dad?

554
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,032
Dad?

555
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,593
Dad?

556
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:30,131
Dad?

557
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:43,838
Come on, wake up.

558
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:54,457
Help! Somebody help!

559
00:45:25,423 --> 00:45:27,350
Simba!

560
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,019
What have you done?

561
00:45:31,696 --> 00:45:33,624
It was a stampede.

562
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:35,159
He tried to save me.

563
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:37,694
It was an accident.

564
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,631
- I didn't mean for it to...
- Of course you didn't.

565
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:44,202
No one ever means
for these things to happen.

566
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,070
But the king is dead...

567
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,037
and if it weren't for you...

568
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,742
he'd still be alive.

569
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:54,679
Your father had such hopes
for you...

570
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:58,015
gave you so many chances.

571
00:45:58,055 --> 00:46:00,323
And this is how you repay him.

572
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:03,387
I didn't know. I didn't know.

573
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,423
Oh, what will your mother think?

574
00:46:05,463 --> 00:46:08,993
A son who causes
his father's death.

575
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:13,895
A boy who kills a king.

576
00:46:14,372 --> 00:46:16,902
What am I gonna do?

577
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:19,236
Run.

578
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:22,610
Run away, Simba.

579
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:26,505
Run away and never return!

580
00:46:38,329 --> 00:46:40,859
Kill him.

581
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:21,594
Go down and make sure he's dead.

582
00:47:29,113 --> 00:47:30,474
Seriously?

583
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,577
Oh, I'm sorry.

584
00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:36,147
That's a good distance
right there.

585
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:37,511
Okay.

586
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:42,250
No little cub
could survive that fall.

587
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,188
Listen. We're gonna tell her...

588
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:47,258
we went down there
and we ate him.

589
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:49,260
That's perfect,
'cause I am starving!

590
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,961
We're not gonna eat him.

591
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:52,296
Simba is dead.

592
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:55,036
That's all she ever has to know.

593
00:47:56,674 --> 00:47:58,305
Works for me.

594
00:48:52,363 --> 00:48:57,600
Mufasa's death
is a terrible tragedy.

595
00:48:57,701 --> 00:49:00,765
The greatest leader
the pride has ever known.

596
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:03,429
To lose a brother...

597
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:08,571
such a deep, personal loss.

598
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:13,110
And little Simba,
who had barely begun to live.

599
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:16,847
A cub whose blood
held our future.

600
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:20,350
It's almost too much to endure.

601
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:24,355
I only wish I had gotten
to the gorge in time...

602
00:49:24,395 --> 00:49:27,687
been there to save them.

603
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:33,369
And so it is
with a heavy heart...

604
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:36,132
that I must assume the throne.

605
00:49:36,407 --> 00:49:39,236
Mufasa and Simba are gone...

606
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:43,478
which means I am your king.

607
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,244
But I must admit...

608
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:50,314
I cannot bear this burden alone.

609
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:55,920
And I will need some help...
to ensure

610
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,285
the safety of the pride.

611
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:08,766
Nala, stay close.

612
00:50:08,806 --> 00:50:12,970
And so, from the ashes
of this tragedy...

613
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:17,474
we shall welcome
the dawning of a new era.

614
00:50:17,648 --> 00:50:19,279
A great...

615
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,313
and glorious future!

616
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,655
Oh, dear.

617
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,066
I missed 'em!

618
00:52:22,106 --> 00:52:23,934
I'm gonna get one of
those vultures one day.

619
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,035
I'm gonna get one!

620
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:26,770
I don't know why it's
so important to you.

621
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,073
I just feel like it would
make me feel better.

622
00:52:29,113 --> 00:52:31,229
Oh, no. It's a little lion!

623
00:52:31,269 --> 00:52:33,377
- That is not a lion.
- Well then, go check it out.

624
00:52:33,417 --> 00:52:35,613
- What is it?
- That is not a lion, it's a furry bird!

625
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:36,981
It looks like a lion!

626
00:52:37,021 --> 00:52:39,783
That's not a lion. Let me get
a closer look. Excuse me.

627
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,594
All right, let me see
what we're dealing with here.

628
00:52:42,634 --> 00:52:43,628
It's a lion!

629
00:52:43,668 --> 00:52:45,255
- Run for your life, Pumbaa!
- Waitl Hey, Timon.

630
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:48,125
- Wait, Timon, wait!
- It's a little lion!

631
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,493
It gets bigger.

632
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:51,495
Can we keep him?
Can we please keep him?

633
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:53,564
Oh, oh, okay. I promise
I'll walk him every day!

634
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:54,999
If he makes a little mess,
I'll clean it up.

635
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:56,266
You'll be his little mess!

636
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,469
He's gonna eat you and then
use my body as a toothpick!

637
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:00,504
But one day,
when he's big and strong,

638
00:53:00,544 --> 00:53:01,939
he'll be on our side!

639
00:53:01,979 --> 00:53:04,441
I've got it.
What if he's on our side?

640
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:05,809
Hear me out!

641
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,980
Having a ferocious lion around
might not be such a bad idea!

642
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,448
Well then, can we keep him?

643
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:12,850
Yes, of course we can keep him!

644
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:15,586
My God, who is the brains
of this operation?

645
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:17,521
We're gonna name him Fred!

646
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:19,624
Who are you?

647
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:21,592
We're the guys
who saved your life.

648
00:53:21,632 --> 00:53:22,660
Yes.

649
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,029
Risked everything.
Fought off angry vultures!

650
00:53:25,069 --> 00:53:26,830
Hordes of them. Flocks.

651
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,332
I'm Pumbaa.

652
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:29,667
- This is Timon.
- Did I mention

653
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:31,168
that we saved your life?

654
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,476
It doesn't matter.

655
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:37,274
How bleak is that?

656
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:38,375
It doesn't even matter?

657
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:40,711
Like I don't have enough
that I'm dealing with, right?

658
00:53:40,751 --> 00:53:42,312
Now his problems
are my problems?

659
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:44,648
But we can help him. We're
in a position to help him.

660
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:48,822
So, how are you,
in as few words as possible?

661
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:51,021
I did something terrible.

662
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,023
I don't wanna talk about it.

663
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,726
Look, kid,
we've all made mistakes.

664
00:53:55,766 --> 00:53:58,629
There must be something
we can do, right?

665
00:53:58,669 --> 00:54:00,798
Not unless you can change
the past.

666
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:02,199
Well, you know,
that's a lot to ask...

667
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,401
That's pretty hard. That's a biggie.
If I'm being honest.

668
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:06,136
I mean, change the past?
It already happened.

669
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:07,971
Yeah, so you can't change that.

670
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:09,591
But you know
what you can change?

671
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,476
The future.
That's our specialty.

672
00:54:12,516 --> 00:54:13,977
Kind of ourthing.

673
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:16,547
How can you change something
that hasn't happened?

674
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:18,716
Well, to change the future,

675
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:20,350
you got to put your past
behind you.

676
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:21,418
Way behind.

677
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:23,821
Look, kid, bad things happen

678
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:26,056
and you can't do anything
about it, right?

679
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,191
Right.

680
00:54:27,231 --> 00:54:29,927
Wrong! When the world
turns its back on you...

681
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:31,883
you turn your back on the world!

682
00:54:31,923 --> 00:54:33,986
And only embrace what's next!

683
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,333
And turn the "what"
into "so what?"

684
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:38,602
Well, that's not
what I was taught.

685
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:40,671
Well, then maybe
you need a new lesson.

686
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:45,448
Repeat after me, kid.
Hakuna matata.

687
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:47,778
- What?
- Hakuna matata.

688
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:49,346
Hakuna matata.

689
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:50,447
Most people
get a bigger reaction

690
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:51,715
when we say it the first...

691
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:53,217
Okay, well anyway.
Hakuna matata.

692
00:54:53,257 --> 00:54:54,752
Some people
start clapping immediately.

693
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:57,187
It means "no worries."
One and a...

694
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:59,389
Ldo the counting here.

695
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:01,391
- I wanna count!
- Why don't we count together?

696
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:02,893
- Okay, that's a good idea.
- All right.

697
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:04,598
One and a two and a...

698
00:55:04,835 --> 00:55:06,762
Hakuna matata.

699
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:10,103
What a wonderful phrase.

700
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:12,638
Hakuna matata.

701
00:55:12,943 --> 00:55:16,644
It ain't no passing craze.

702
00:55:16,847 --> 00:55:21,777
It means no worries
For the rest of your days.

703
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,981
It's our problem-free.

704
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:27,947
Philosophy.

705
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:31,283
Hakuna matata.

706
00:55:32,029 --> 00:55:35,159
- Hakuna matata?
- Yeah, it's our motto.

707
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:36,593
What's a motto?

708
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:38,095
Nothin'.
What's-a-motto with you?

709
00:55:38,135 --> 00:55:39,396
- Nice.
- Boom!

710
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:41,965
Those two words
will solve all your problems.

711
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,668
Yeah. Take Pumbaa here.

712
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:48,472
Why,
when he was a young warthog.

713
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:52,009
When I was a young warthog.

714
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:55,679
- How are you feeling?
- It's an emotional story.

715
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:58,482
He found his aroma
lacked a certain appeal.

716
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:01,518
He could clear the savannah
after every meal.

717
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:03,654
I'm a sensitive soul.

718
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:07,486
Although Iseem thick-skinned.

719
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:13,297
And it hurt that my friends
never stood downwind

720
00:56:13,337 --> 00:56:15,699
I was always here for you
and I resent that.

721
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:18,368
- And, oh, the shame.
- Yes, he was ashamed

722
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:20,103
I thought of changing my name

723
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:21,772
I mean, to what, "Brad"?

724
00:56:21,812 --> 00:56:24,808
And I got downhearted.

725
00:56:25,015 --> 00:56:27,544
Ev'ry time that I farted.

726
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:29,012
Are you gonna stop me?

727
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,982
No, I'm not! You disgust me!

728
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:34,051
Hakuna matata.

729
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:37,452
What a wonderful phrase.

730
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:39,790
Hakuna matata.

731
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:42,696
Ain't no passing craze.

732
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:47,898
It means no worries
For the rest of your days.

733
00:56:47,938 --> 00:56:49,399
Yeah, sing it, kid.

734
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:54,972
It's our
problem-free Philosophy.

735
00:56:55,012 --> 00:56:57,177
Hakuna matata.

736
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,880
Welcome to our humble home.

737
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,314
You live here?

738
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:05,749
Well, we live wherever we want.

739
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:07,217
We do as we please.

740
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,418
It's beautiful.

741
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:10,749
Yeah, it's really nice?

742
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:14,091
Everyone, this is Simba.

743
00:57:14,131 --> 00:57:16,159
That, my friend, is a lion.

744
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,662
What about food? Have you
thought about feeding that thing?

745
00:57:18,702 --> 00:57:21,231
Yeah, I'm starved!
I could eat a whole zebra.

746
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,599
Here we go.

747
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:25,435
No, no, no, kid,
we're fresh out of zebra.

748
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:26,770
Any antelope?

749
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,705
- Oh.
- No, listen, kid...

750
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:30,941
if you want to live with us,
you have to eat like us.

751
00:57:30,981 --> 00:57:34,182
And most importantly,
not eat us!

752
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:37,744
This looks like a good
spot to rustle up some grub!

753
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:40,617
Yeahl - It's perfect!

754
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:41,919
Step aside, fellas!

755
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,453
What's that?

756
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:44,688
Too chewy.

757
00:57:44,728 --> 00:57:46,189
This one's got some nuttiness!

758
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:48,792
Now that's what
I call umami!

759
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:51,361
Slimy, yet satisfying.

760
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:52,462
Extra crunchy.

761
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:54,097
- They're local.
- Yeah. Oh, are they?

762
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,365
They're from right there.

763
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:57,768
I'm telling ya, kid,
this is the great life.

764
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:58,936
No rules.

765
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:00,904
No responsibilities.

766
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:03,607
The little cream-filled kind.

767
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,875
I love these!

768
00:58:04,915 --> 00:58:05,976
- Those are good.
- I love these.

769
00:58:06,016 --> 00:58:07,077
Those are the best.

770
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:08,145
Can I have the head?

771
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:09,485
Well, kid?

772
00:58:10,354 --> 00:58:11,982
Oh, well.

773
00:58:12,022 --> 00:58:13,914
Hakuna matata.

774
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,719
Slirny...

775
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:22,092
yet satisfying.

776
00:58:22,132 --> 00:58:23,827
- That's it!
- We didn't lie!

777
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:26,795
Egg sac! I got an egg sac!

790
00:59:16,563 --> 00:59:17,848
One more time.

791
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:19,891
Oh, no, I think we did it. Yeah.
I think we got this one.

792
00:59:19,915 --> 00:59:21,284
But we're just getting
in the groove, guys.

793
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:22,452
No, let's leave 'em
wanting more.

794
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:24,154
Yeah, you've grown
400 pounds since we started.

795
00:59:24,194 --> 00:59:25,989
Meanwhile I look
exactly the same.

796
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:27,190
It means no worries.

797
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,325
Will you tell him to stop?

798
00:59:28,365 --> 00:59:30,604
But you insisted we sing the song.
I insisted? You started singing it!

799
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:32,829
Well, it's our signature song we
shouldn't be sharing it with everyone.

800
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:35,065
Look at that sunset. But
it's our signature song, so we have to.

801
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:37,300
Look, just tell him to stop.

802
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,869
It means no worries.

803
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,070
Oh, how he's riffing, Pumbaa.

804
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:41,204
This is a nightmare.

805
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,504
It actually is
becoming better and better.

806
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:19,246
Nala.

807
01:00:19,716 --> 01:00:21,016
Come.

808
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:22,749
Sit with us.

809
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:34,395
Zazu, where have you been?

810
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:38,222
I'm sorry, Nala.
I came as soon as I could.

811
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,399
The morning report, Zazu.

812
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:47,604
Your Majesty, the Pride Lands
are in imminent danger.

813
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,740
The hyenas are chasing off
the last of the herds.

814
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,138
The bird's back!

815
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,216
Get him!

816
01:00:58,922 --> 01:01:02,248
Don't come here again,
unless you want to be eaten!

817
01:01:25,315 --> 01:01:28,478
We have to do something,
Sarabi. We have to fight!

818
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:32,249
Nala. Scar is the king.

819
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:34,017
But you are our queen!

820
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:36,286
We should leave
before it's too late!

821
01:01:36,326 --> 01:01:40,590
We must all stay together
and protect the Pride Lands.

822
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:44,294
This is our home.
We must never abandon it.

823
01:01:44,334 --> 01:01:46,463
This isn't the home I remember.

824
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:49,332
Our time will come, Nala.

825
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,700
Be patient.

826
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,473
Sarabi.

827
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:55,974
The king wishes to see you.

828
01:01:56,513 --> 01:01:58,440
Don't go.

829
01:01:59,349 --> 01:02:02,049
I'm not afraid of him.

830
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,396
Won't you join me, Sarabi?

831
01:02:19,436 --> 01:02:21,565
There's plenty to go around.

832
01:02:21,605 --> 01:02:23,500
You're overhunting, Scar.

833
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:25,865
I've simply perfected the kill.

834
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:28,138
With the help of my army.

835
01:02:28,178 --> 01:02:30,639
You're killing everything.

836
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:34,077
Don't you see? There is nobody
to challenge me.

837
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:36,817
We can finally take
whatever we want.

838
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,682
We?

839
01:02:38,722 --> 01:02:42,485
Long ago
you chose Mufasa over me.

840
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:44,759
But now there is a new king.

841
01:02:45,028 --> 01:02:47,421
So stop being so selfish.

842
01:02:47,564 --> 01:02:49,426
You are the selfish one.

843
01:02:49,466 --> 01:02:51,561
The other lions look to you.

844
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,836
As long as you resist
they will reject me.

845
01:02:55,405 --> 01:03:00,199
Take your place by my side,
and we will feast together.

846
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,712
I will never be your queen!

847
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:06,943
Then from now on...

848
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:11,348
the lions will eat
after the hyenas.

849
01:03:11,388 --> 01:03:14,248
And they don't
leave much behind.

850
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:44,974
Just what do you think

851
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:47,110
you are doing, young lady?

852
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:48,645
Go away, Zazu.

853
01:04:48,685 --> 01:04:50,513
I'm going to find help.

854
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:52,449
I will very much not go away.

855
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:56,052
I am sworn to protect you and
must order you back to bed.

856
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:59,054
I don't need protecting anymore.

857
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:52,041
Soar!
Wonderful to see you.

858
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:54,281
Sorry to drop in like this!

859
01:05:55,652 --> 01:05:58,515
Have I ever told you
about my brother

860
01:05:58,555 --> 01:06:00,914
who thought he was a woodpecker?

861
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:16,197
Nala...

862
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:41,424
Oh, I'm gonna get ya!

863
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:43,226
I'm gonna get ya! Oh, I got ya!

864
01:06:43,266 --> 01:06:44,894
Oh.

865
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:46,830
Simba! It's you!

866
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:48,298
Did you see that?

867
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:49,833
Man, that butterfly
was right there!

868
01:06:49,873 --> 01:06:51,299
Ialmost had him.

869
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:52,669
I thought it was a lion.

870
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:54,471
You know,
the other kind of lion.

871
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:55,972
You know, a real lion?

872
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,640
I mean, not that
you're not a real lion.

873
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,642
But you know,
the kind that eats...

874
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,176
I'm gonna go.

875
01:07:01,818 --> 01:07:03,580
Hey, where you going?

876
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:06,115
You wanna get some grubs?

877
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,420
What's up with that guy?

878
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:11,760
Simba...

879
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:14,023
How can I say this?

880
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:15,959
- He's prey.
- Yeah.

881
01:07:15,999 --> 01:07:20,196
And he is never gonna want to
frolic with a carnivore.

882
01:07:20,236 --> 01:07:22,332
No. You two will never frolic.

883
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:24,100
Why not?

884
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:28,538
You see, in nature
there's a delicate balance.

885
01:07:28,578 --> 01:07:30,607
Oh, yeah. The circle of life.
I know that.

886
01:07:30,647 --> 01:07:33,443
No, no, no. I don't know where
you're getting "circle" from.

887
01:07:33,483 --> 01:07:34,511
No, yeah.

888
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:35,645
There's no circle of life.

889
01:07:35,685 --> 01:07:39,115
- No, it's no circle. No, not at all.
- In fact, it's the opposite. Yeah.

890
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:40,383
- It's a line.
- Yeah.

891
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:43,052
It's a meaningless line
of indifference.

892
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:45,655
And we're all just running
towards the end of the line.

893
01:07:45,695 --> 01:07:49,058
And then one day we'll reach
the end, and that'll be it.

894
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:50,326
- That's it.
- Line over!

895
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:52,228
Nada.

896
01:07:52,268 --> 01:07:53,563
And you can really just kinda...

897
01:07:53,603 --> 01:07:55,465
do your own thing
and fend for yourself...

898
01:07:55,505 --> 01:07:57,400
'cause your line doesn't
affect anyone else's lines.

899
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,970
You're alive and then
you're not. Like this guy.

900
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:03,171
You sure it's not a circle?

901
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:05,174
That we're all connected?

902
01:08:05,214 --> 01:08:07,577
A circle would mean
we're all this.

903
01:08:07,617 --> 01:08:10,046
That would mean
what I do affects him...

904
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,648
affects that thing,
affects that thing.

905
01:08:11,688 --> 01:08:13,249
Yeah. No.
That's not how it goes.

906
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:14,984
Which would make
doing whatever we wanted

907
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:16,352
not that cool.

908
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:17,987
Let me simplify this for you.

909
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:19,856
- Life is meaningless.
- Yes.

910
01:08:19,896 --> 01:08:21,858
That's why you just got to
look out for yourself.

911
01:08:21,898 --> 01:08:23,393
That's why you do you, Simba.

912
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:25,762
Yeah, Simba,
for the first time...

913
01:08:25,802 --> 01:08:28,231
we're entrusting you to
make a plan for us today.

914
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:31,034
This is important. Think about
all you've been taught.

915
01:08:31,074 --> 01:08:33,342
What do you wanna do?

916
01:08:34,077 --> 01:08:37,175
Absolutely nothing.

917
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:40,176
- Hoo!
- Exactlyl He gets it!

918
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:42,011
Jackpot!

919
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:43,079
Out of my way! Out of my way!

920
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:46,047
- Crunchy!
- All right! Time to eat!

921
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:58,428
Oh.

922
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:00,697
Hello!

923
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:02,699
Nice one, Simba.

924
01:09:02,739 --> 01:09:05,401
0h, thanks.
Must've been the termites.

925
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:07,641
Or the crickets.

926
01:09:08,778 --> 01:09:11,774
And you wonder why I prefer
to sleep underground.

927
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,077
Hey, Timon.

928
01:09:14,117 --> 01:09:15,411
Do you ever look up there

929
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:17,914
and wonder
what those sparkly dots are?

930
01:09:17,954 --> 01:09:21,784
0h, Pumbaa.
I don't wonder. I know.

931
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:24,115
Really? What are they?

932
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,822
They're fireflies.

933
01:09:25,862 --> 01:09:29,926
Fireflies that got stuck on
that big, bluish-black thing.

934
01:09:29,966 --> 01:09:31,127
Oh.

935
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,562
I guess that makes sense.

936
01:09:32,602 --> 01:09:34,597
I always thought
they were balls of gas

937
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:36,833
burning billions of miles away.

938
01:09:36,873 --> 01:09:39,335
Oh, Pumbaa, why is everything
always gas with you?

939
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:41,108
I know.

940
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:42,939
- What do you think, Simba?
- Yeah.

941
01:09:42,979 --> 01:09:45,474
Oh, I don't know.

942
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:48,411
But somebody once told me...

943
01:09:48,451 --> 01:09:50,780
the great kings of the past
are Up there...

944
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:54,146
and they're all
watching over us.

945
01:09:58,294 --> 01:10:01,924
That's a good one!
That's insane!

946
01:10:01,964 --> 01:10:04,095
That's insane!

947
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:07,096
Royal dead guys
watching over us!

948
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:09,198
Well, I hope they don't
fall out of the sky!

949
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:11,934
Hang on, Your Majesty!
Don't let go!

950
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:13,436
Oh, that would be a mess.

951
01:10:13,476 --> 01:10:14,537
Oh, man!

952
01:10:14,577 --> 01:10:15,705
I mean, Simba, think about it.

953
01:10:15,745 --> 01:10:18,207
Why would a bunch of kings
be looking out for us?

954
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:20,376
- We're outcasts.
- Royal warthogs!

955
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:23,112
- I can't! I can't!
- I can't! I actually can't.

956
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:27,047
- I can't.
- No, you can. I can't.

957
01:10:28,191 --> 01:10:31,020
Yeah. Yeah.

958
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,189
Yeah.

959
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:34,891
That's stupid.

960
01:10:34,931 --> 01:10:39,224
I'm gonna go get some grubs
or something.

961
01:10:45,942 --> 01:10:48,638
- What did you say to him?
- I don't know.

962
01:10:48,678 --> 01:10:49,972
As you were saying it,

963
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:51,507
I thought,
"This won't end well."

964
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:53,910
- You just start laughing.
- You laughed too.

965
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:57,413
I did not. I would never.

966
01:10:57,453 --> 01:10:59,744
Man, I blew it.

967
01:14:05,074 --> 01:14:07,001
Simba.

968
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:15,877
Simba is alive!

969
01:14:40,443 --> 01:14:45,442
A-weema-weh A-weema-weh.

970
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:52,782
A-weema-weh
A-weema-weh TIMON: Wee.

971
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:59,755
Wee bum bum buh-weh Wee.

972
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:03,092
Wee bum bum buh-weh.

973
01:15:03,132 --> 01:15:06,595
In the jungle, the mighty jungle.

974
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:10,066
The lion sleeps tonight.

975
01:15:10,106 --> 01:15:13,436
In the jungle, the quiet jungle.

976
01:15:13,476 --> 01:15:17,143
The lion sleeps tonight.

977
01:15:17,213 --> 01:15:23,581
Wee Wee bum bum buh-weh.

978
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:30,619
Wee Wee bum bum buh-weh.

979
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:34,088
Near the village,
the peaceful village.

980
01:15:34,397 --> 01:15:37,165
The lion sleeps tonight.

981
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,430
Near the village,
the quiet village.

982
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:44,671
The lion sleeps tonight.

983
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:51,771
Wee Wee bum bum buh-weh.

984
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:55,617
Wee.

985
01:15:59,822 --> 01:16:01,122
Pumbaa!

986
01:16:01,357 --> 01:16:03,625
Run for your life!

987
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:06,327
Run, Pumbaa, run!

988
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:13,968
Timon, help!

989
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,702
Pumbaa!

990
01:16:18,207 --> 01:16:19,635
Pumbaa?

991
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:22,638
I'm gonna die!

992
01:16:22,678 --> 01:16:24,570
I'm coming, Pumbaa!
Hang in there!

993
01:16:26,182 --> 01:16:28,347
Move! Move! Move!

994
01:16:38,861 --> 01:16:40,161
No!

995
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:42,561
Oh, no! Oh, no!

996
01:16:42,798 --> 01:16:44,098
No!

997
01:17:02,418 --> 01:17:03,718
Nala?

998
01:17:03,919 --> 01:17:06,210
Simba?

999
01:17:06,555 --> 01:17:08,417
Is that really you?

1000
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:09,752
Yeah.

1001
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:11,923
It's me, Simba!

1002
01:17:13,929 --> 01:17:15,024
Nala, what're you doing?
Oh, my...

1003
01:17:15,064 --> 01:17:16,192
I don't believe it!

1004
01:17:16,232 --> 01:17:17,560
Look at you!

1005
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,627
Pumbaa...

1006
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:20,594
I don't think
you're getting eaten.

1007
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,465
Oh, where have you been?

1008
01:17:22,505 --> 01:17:24,033
I thought you were dead!

1009
01:17:24,073 --> 01:17:27,136
You thought he was
dead. I thought I was dead!

1010
01:17:27,176 --> 01:17:29,238
I thought you were gonna eat me.

1011
01:17:29,278 --> 01:17:31,440
What fun!

1012
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,409
I'm so sorry, before we move on,

1013
01:17:33,449 --> 01:17:34,743
how do you two know each other?

1014
01:17:34,783 --> 01:17:35,978
Timon, Pumbaa...

1015
01:17:36,018 --> 01:17:38,080
I want you to meet
my best friend, Nala.

1016
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,749
Best friend? Well, that hurts.

1017
01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:42,318
Nala. You're gonna love it here!

1018
01:17:42,358 --> 01:17:43,419
This place is amazing.

1019
01:17:43,459 --> 01:17:45,317
It's everything
you could ever want.

1020
01:17:45,528 --> 01:17:47,556
Simba, we need to leave.

1021
01:17:47,596 --> 01:17:50,831
Scar has taken over
with the hyenas.

1022
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:53,896
You have to take your place
as king.

1023
01:17:53,936 --> 01:17:55,498
King? Simba?

1024
01:17:55,538 --> 01:17:58,000
We kneel before you
as loyal servants.

1025
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,136
Pumbaa, relax. She's wrong.

1026
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:01,570
Lady, you've got
your lions crossed.

1027
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:02,638
Nice.

1028
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,273
Seeing you again,

1029
01:18:04,313 --> 01:18:06,308
you don't know what this will
mean to everyone.

1030
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:08,644
What this means to me.

1031
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,846
You have to come home.

1032
01:18:10,886 --> 01:18:13,177
This is my home.

1033
01:18:13,656 --> 01:18:15,084
Please stay.

1034
01:18:15,124 --> 01:18:16,752
This place is incredible.

1035
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:18,521
I know you'll love it.

1036
01:18:18,561 --> 01:18:20,089
I can't.

1037
01:18:20,129 --> 01:18:21,524
Come on!

1038
01:18:21,564 --> 01:18:23,492
At least let me show you around.

1039
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:25,823
Where are you going?

1040
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:36,043
Simba, it's so beautiful.

1041
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:40,109
I can see what's happening I
can't, What?

1042
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:42,978
And they don't have
a clue Who's "they"?

1043
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:46,651
They'll fall in love
And here's the bottom line.

1044
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:49,852
Our trio's down to two
Oh, I get it.

1045
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:52,788
The sweet caress
of twilight Yeah.

1046
01:18:52,828 --> 01:18:55,991
There's magic ev'rywhere
It's ev'rywhere.

1047
01:18:56,031 --> 01:19:00,165
And with all this
romantic atmosphere.

1048
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:05,230
Disaster's in the air.

1049
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:14,071
Can you feel the love tonight?

1050
01:19:15,618 --> 01:19:20,184
The peace the evening brings.

1051
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:27,389
The world for once
in perfect harmony.

1052
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:32,325
With all its living things.

1053
01:19:33,736 --> 01:19:36,834
So many things to tell her.

1054
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:42,771
But how to make her see
The truth about my past?

1055
01:19:42,811 --> 01:19:46,279
Impossible She'd
turn away from me.

1056
01:19:46,548 --> 01:19:49,373
He's holding back, he's hiding.

1057
01:19:49,585 --> 01:19:53,015
But what, I can't decide.

1058
01:19:53,055 --> 01:19:56,285
Why won't he be the king
I know he is?

1059
01:19:56,325 --> 01:20:00,391
The king I see inside?

1060
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:06,133
Can you feel the love tonight?

1061
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:12,431
The peace the evening brings.

1062
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:19,611
The world for once
in perfect harmony.

1063
01:20:19,682 --> 01:20:24,214
With all its living things.

1064
01:20:26,355 --> 01:20:31,820
Can you feel the love tonight?

1065
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:38,464
You needn't look too far.

1066
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:45,301
Stealing through
the night's uncertainties.

1067
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:50,135
Love is where they are.

1068
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:57,774
And if he falls in love tonight.

1069
01:20:58,987 --> 01:21:03,417
It can be assumed.

1070
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:10,460
His carefree days
with us are history.

1071
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:17,667
In short, our pal is doomed.

1072
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:33,782
I told you. Isn't it great here?

1073
01:21:33,822 --> 01:21:35,818
You know, maybe it could be
like this forever.

1074
01:21:35,858 --> 01:21:37,989
It's amazing.

1075
01:21:38,093 --> 01:21:41,457
But there's something
I don't understand.

1076
01:21:41,497 --> 01:21:43,859
If you've been alive
all this time...

1077
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:45,961
why haven't you come home?

1078
01:21:46,001 --> 01:21:48,197
We've really needed you.

1079
01:21:48,237 --> 01:21:49,798
They're fine, all right?

1080
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:51,300
Nobody needs me.

1081
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:53,168
You're the king.

1082
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:56,004
Nala, Scar is the king.

1083
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:59,041
Simba, he's decimated
the Pride Lands.

1084
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:01,009
There's no food, no water...

1085
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:03,078
There's nothing I can do.

1086
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:04,813
What about your mother?

1087
01:22:04,853 --> 01:22:06,915
This is your responsibility.

1088
01:22:06,955 --> 01:22:08,484
You need to challenge Scar.

1089
01:22:08,524 --> 01:22:11,487
I can't go back. Ever.

1090
01:22:11,527 --> 01:22:12,855
Why?

1091
01:22:12,895 --> 01:22:14,757
Because of what happened
at the gorge?

1092
01:22:14,797 --> 01:22:16,058
Scar told us that...

1093
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:17,426
You wouldn't understand!

1094
01:22:17,466 --> 01:22:19,027
None of It matters. Okay?

1095
01:22:19,067 --> 01:22:20,529
Hakuna matata.

1096
01:22:20,569 --> 01:22:21,697
What?

1097
01:22:21,737 --> 01:22:23,599
It's something
I learned out here, okay?

1098
01:22:23,639 --> 01:22:25,334
You see,
sometimes bad things happen,

1099
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:27,102
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

1100
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:28,837
So, why worry?

1101
01:22:28,877 --> 01:22:30,873
Why worry?

1102
01:22:30,913 --> 01:22:32,908
What happened to you?

1103
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:35,411
You're not the Simba I remember.

1104
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:38,247
And I never will be.
Are you satisfied?

1105
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:40,115
No, I'm disappointed.

1106
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:42,418
You know, now you're starting
to sound like my father.

1107
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:45,420
Good. I'm glad one of us does.

1108
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:48,357
You have no idea
what I've been through!

1109
01:22:48,397 --> 01:22:51,257
Icame here looking for help.

1110
01:22:52,768 --> 01:22:55,468
I guess I made a mistake.

1111
01:22:56,271 --> 01:22:58,266
Goodbye, Simba.

1112
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:16,389
"Disappointed"?

1113
01:23:16,792 --> 01:23:18,987
She wants me to go home?

1114
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:21,056
I am home.

1115
01:23:21,096 --> 01:23:23,158
"Best friend"?

1116
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:25,796
I don't need best friends.
I don't need anybody.

1117
01:23:26,101 --> 01:23:27,766
Neverdid.

1118
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:56,592
Go away.

1119
01:23:56,632 --> 01:23:59,294
Going away will not
answer the question.

1120
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:02,262
What question? Who are you?

1121
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:04,466
I know exactly who I am.

1122
01:24:04,506 --> 01:24:07,206
The question is, who are you?

1123
01:24:07,676 --> 01:24:11,673
I'm nobody. So leave me alone.
All right?

1124
01:24:11,747 --> 01:24:16,006
Everybody is somebody.
Even a nobody.

1125
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:18,215
Yeah, I think you're confused.

1126
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:20,878
I am confused?

1127
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:23,719
You don't even know who you are.

1128
01:24:23,759 --> 01:24:26,027
Oh. And I suppose you do?

1129
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:30,224
I held the son of Mufasa.

1130
01:24:32,334 --> 01:24:33,662
You knew my father?

1131
01:24:33,702 --> 01:24:34,830
Correction.

1132
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:36,732
I know your father.

1133
01:24:36,772 --> 01:24:39,067
He died a long time ago.

1134
01:24:39,107 --> 01:24:40,965
He's alive!

1135
01:24:41,176 --> 01:24:43,171
And I can take you to him.

1136
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:45,140
Follow me. I will show you!

1137
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:46,208
Hey, hey, hey!

1138
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:47,640
If you can keep up!

1139
01:24:48,050 --> 01:24:49,749
Wait!

1140
01:24:59,061 --> 01:25:00,885
Follow me!

1141
01:25:07,302 --> 01:25:10,070
Quickly, quickly! Come through!

1142
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:15,542
Hey! Slow down!

1143
01:25:17,813 --> 01:25:20,676
Hey, you better hurry.

1144
01:25:20,716 --> 01:25:23,610
Hold on. I'm coming, I'm coming.

1145
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:44,969
Come.

1146
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:57,616
Your father is waiting.

1147
01:26:09,464 --> 01:26:11,595
Do you see him?

1148
01:26:12,601 --> 01:26:14,994
I don't see anything.

1149
01:26:16,805 --> 01:26:18,436
Look closer.

1150
01:26:23,445 --> 01:26:25,576
YoU see?

1151
01:26:26,481 --> 01:26:29,341
He lives in you.

1152
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,749
Simba.

1153
01:26:39,561 --> 01:26:41,260
Dad?

1154
01:26:41,697 --> 01:26:43,492
Simba.

1155
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:48,633
You must take your place
in the circle of life.

1156
01:26:49,905 --> 01:26:50,966
I can't.

1157
01:26:51,006 --> 01:26:54,102
You must remember who you are.

1158
01:26:54,142 --> 01:26:56,638
The one true king.

1159
01:26:56,678 --> 01:26:58,036
I'm sorry.

1160
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:01,281
I don't know how to be like you.

1161
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:05,714
As king, I was most proud
of one thing.

1162
01:27:05,754 --> 01:27:08,614
Having you as my son.

1163
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:13,019
That was a long time ago.

1164
01:27:13,095 --> 01:27:17,331
No, Simba. That Is forever.

1165
01:27:20,168 --> 01:27:21,697
Please.

1166
01:27:21,737 --> 01:27:23,800
Don't leave me again.

1167
01:27:23,872 --> 01:27:26,034
I never left you.

1168
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:28,501
And never will.

1169
01:27:29,678 --> 01:27:32,538
Remember who you are.

1170
01:27:34,616 --> 01:27:37,180
Remember.

1171
01:27:46,294 --> 01:27:49,157
And so, I ask again.

1172
01:27:49,197 --> 01:27:50,521
Who are you?

1173
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:54,930
I am Simba.

1174
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:57,534
Son of Mufasa.

1175
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:26,623
Yeah Spirit.

1176
01:28:27,269 --> 01:28:31,130
Watch the heavens open.

1177
01:28:32,841 --> 01:28:35,234
Yeah.

1178
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:38,804
Spirit.

1179
01:28:39,114 --> 01:28:43,111
Can you hear It calling?

1180
01:28:44,352 --> 01:28:46,984
Yeah.

1181
01:28:49,424 --> 01:28:50,585
Simba?

1182
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:53,121
Come on!
What are you waiting for?

1183
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:54,951
Let's go home!

1184
01:28:59,301 --> 01:29:02,900
Spirit.

1185
01:29:03,271 --> 01:29:11,139
Watch the heavens
open, open Yeah.

1186
01:29:11,713 --> 01:29:15,414
Your destiny is coming close.

1187
01:29:15,650 --> 01:29:18,680
Stand up and fight.

1188
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:28,456
So, go In to a far-off land.

1189
01:29:28,496 --> 01:29:35,167
And be one with the great I am.

1190
01:29:47,415 --> 01:29:49,845
I didn't wanna believe you.

1191
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:52,113
So, what are you gonna do?

1192
01:29:52,153 --> 01:29:53,949
My father
once told me to protect

1193
01:29:53,989 --> 01:29:55,851
everything the light touches.

1194
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:58,887
If I don't fight for it,
who will?

1195
01:30:00,028 --> 01:30:01,723
I will.

1196
01:30:01,763 --> 01:30:03,458
It's going to be dangerous.

1197
01:30:03,498 --> 01:30:05,493
Danger? Ha!

1198
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:09,030
I laugh in the face of danger.

1199
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:14,569
It can't be!

1200
01:30:14,609 --> 01:30:16,805
Hello, Zazu.

1201
01:30:16,845 --> 01:30:18,976
Your Majesty.

1202
01:30:19,214 --> 01:30:20,879
Welcome home.

1203
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:24,980
We're here!

1204
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:26,581
Oh, everyone, calm down.
We're here.

1205
01:30:26,621 --> 01:30:28,516
The backup has arrived!

1206
01:30:28,556 --> 01:30:30,151
What are you guys doing here?

1207
01:30:30,191 --> 01:30:33,555
- We were not worried!
- No, notworried.

1208
01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:35,323
- 'Cause no worries.
- Nope. Hakuna matata.

1209
01:30:35,363 --> 01:30:38,894
- We were concerned, because...
- Because, you know...

1210
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:40,395
You're our friend.

1211
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:43,398
What about the meaningless
line of indifference?

1212
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:44,833
Well, we were thinking...

1213
01:30:44,873 --> 01:30:47,035
- maybe it curves a little bit.
- That's a good point.

1214
01:30:47,075 --> 01:30:48,336
I mean, Simba, look,

1215
01:30:48,376 --> 01:30:50,204
I'm happy to admit
when Pumbaa's wrong...

1216
01:30:50,219 --> 01:30:51,506
and this is
one of those instances.

1217
01:30:51,546 --> 01:30:52,707
What? That wasn't my thing.

1218
01:30:52,747 --> 01:30:54,009
You told me about the line.

1219
01:30:54,049 --> 01:30:55,210
Wait, hold on.

1220
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:58,113
Now, this is the place
you're fighting for?

1221
01:30:58,153 --> 01:31:00,548
Yes, Timon. This is my home.

1222
01:31:00,588 --> 01:31:02,884
IS it behind
that terrifying rock?

1223
01:31:02,924 --> 01:31:04,920
Talk about your fixer-upper.

1224
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,388
I like what you've done with it,

1225
01:31:06,428 --> 01:31:08,256
although a bit heavy
on the carcass.

1226
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:10,058
Hey, hey, look. A bird.

1227
01:31:10,098 --> 01:31:12,958
Timon, Pumbaa, this is Zazu.

1228
01:31:13,168 --> 01:31:15,196
Oh! It's a puffin.

1229
01:31:15,236 --> 01:31:16,867
Charming.

1230
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:20,869
Simba, we are with you
until the end.

1231
01:31:20,909 --> 01:31:23,404
We are at your service,
my liege!

1232
01:31:23,578 --> 01:31:25,470
Follow me.

1233
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:41,056
Hyenas everywhere.

1234
01:31:41,096 --> 01:31:42,424
I hope it's a quick death.

1235
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:43,892
You know,
just not a lot of chewing.

1236
01:31:43,932 --> 01:31:45,060
What's your plan for getting us

1237
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:46,560
past the slobbering guards?

1238
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:49,092
Live bait.

1239
01:31:53,141 --> 01:31:54,836
That's a great idea.

1240
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:57,305
Those guys could never
resist fresh meat.

1241
01:31:57,345 --> 01:32:00,475
So all we need to do is find
something that's, like. Big...

1242
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:02,677
and plump, and juicy.

1243
01:32:02,717 --> 01:32:05,144
Maybe like a gnu?

1244
01:32:06,221 --> 01:32:08,648
Why is everyone looking at me?

1245
01:32:14,129 --> 01:32:16,358
It is with deepest pride

1246
01:32:16,398 --> 01:32:18,593
and greatest pleasure...

1247
01:32:18,633 --> 01:32:23,795
that we proudly present...
your dinner.

1248
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:30,141
Be our guest.

1249
01:32:33,181 --> 01:32:35,972
It's working, Pumbaa!

1250
01:33:08,249 --> 01:33:10,983
My old friend.

1251
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:13,846
Sarabi,
why put yourself through this?

1252
01:33:13,888 --> 01:33:16,484
All you have to do
is be my queen.

1253
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:18,086
You're suffering for what?

1254
01:33:18,126 --> 01:33:20,088
The memory of a life
you once knew?

1255
01:33:20,128 --> 01:33:22,419
A king you once loved?

1256
01:33:23,298 --> 01:33:26,828
I tried to make you understand
what a true king can be.

1257
01:33:26,868 --> 01:33:31,666
Scar, a true king's power
is his compassion.

1258
01:33:31,706 --> 01:33:33,902
I am ten times
the king Mufasa was!

1259
01:33:33,942 --> 01:33:36,836
You are nothing
compared to Mufasa!

1260
01:33:47,889 --> 01:33:49,284
Mufasa?

1261
01:33:49,324 --> 01:33:50,682
It can't be.

1262
01:33:50,725 --> 01:33:53,118
Get away from my mother.

1263
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:57,129
Simba.

1264
01:33:59,267 --> 01:34:01,396
You're alive?

1265
01:34:01,436 --> 01:34:03,965
How can that be?

1266
01:34:04,005 --> 01:34:06,201
I'm here, Mother.

1267
01:34:06,241 --> 01:34:07,368
I'm home.

1268
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:09,070
Simba...

1269
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:11,272
I'm so happy to see you.

1270
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:12,612
Alive.

1271
01:34:13,915 --> 01:34:17,912
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't rip you apart.

1272
01:34:17,952 --> 01:34:20,148
I can give you more than one.

1273
01:34:20,188 --> 01:34:21,614
You see...

1274
01:34:21,689 --> 01:34:23,889
they think I'm king.

1275
01:34:25,927 --> 01:34:28,058
Well, we don't.

1276
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:31,255
Your reign is over, Scar.

1277
01:34:31,966 --> 01:34:34,629
Simba is the rightful king!

1278
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:38,333
If you wanna get him,
you have to get through us.

1279
01:34:38,373 --> 01:34:40,732
Are you with me, lions?

1280
01:34:43,811 --> 01:34:47,911
The choice is yours, Scar.
Step down or fight.

1281
01:34:47,982 --> 01:34:50,978
Must this all end in violence?

1282
01:34:52,187 --> 01:34:55,923
I'd hate to be responsible for
the death of a family member.

1283
01:34:56,224 --> 01:34:59,187
To feel the shame of knowing...

1284
01:34:59,227 --> 01:35:01,859
I took the life
of someone I love.

1285
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:03,691
I put all that behind me.

1286
01:35:03,731 --> 01:35:07,095
But have they
put it behind them?

1287
01:35:07,135 --> 01:35:10,031
Do your faithful subjects
know what you've done?

1288
01:35:10,071 --> 01:35:11,699
What is he talking about?

1289
01:35:11,739 --> 01:35:15,336
So you haven't told them
your little secret?

1290
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:17,837
Well, Simba...

1291
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:21,314
now's your chance to confess.

1292
01:35:21,416 --> 01:35:25,117
Tell them who's responsible
for Mufasa's death.

1293
01:35:33,027 --> 01:35:35,156
It was me.

1294
01:35:35,196 --> 01:35:37,327
It's not true.

1295
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:40,161
Tell me it's not true.

1296
01:35:40,201 --> 01:35:42,030
It's true. I'm sorry.

1297
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:43,998
He admits it.

1298
01:35:44,038 --> 01:35:45,166
Murderer!

1299
01:35:45,206 --> 01:35:47,202
No, no. It was an accident.

1300
01:35:47,242 --> 01:35:49,304
If it weren't for you
the king would be alive.

1301
01:35:49,344 --> 01:35:52,006
It's your fault he's dead!
Do you deny it?

1302
01:35:52,046 --> 01:35:53,346
I'm not a murderer.

1303
01:35:53,448 --> 01:35:56,010
We should believe a son who
takes the life of a father?

1304
01:35:56,050 --> 01:35:58,750
We should believe a son
who takes the life of a king?

1305
01:35:58,853 --> 01:36:01,216
A son who abandons his mother?

1306
01:36:01,256 --> 01:36:02,750
No. I'm...

1307
01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:05,853
You're what? Say it!
Are you the king?

1308
01:36:05,893 --> 01:36:07,188
No. No, I'm...

1309
01:36:07,228 --> 01:36:08,590
- Are you the king?
- No, I'm...

1310
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:10,591
- You're what? Say it!
- I'm...

1311
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:13,257
I'm nothing.

1312
01:36:13,368 --> 01:36:15,101
Then bow to your king!

1313
01:36:17,705 --> 01:36:19,063
Simba!

1314
01:36:34,322 --> 01:36:36,584
This looks familiar.

1315
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:41,189
Where have I seen this before?

1316
01:36:41,229 --> 01:36:44,362
Oh, yes, I remember.

1317
01:36:44,966 --> 01:36:48,096
This is the way Mufasa looked
before he died.

1318
01:36:48,136 --> 01:36:54,300
I looked down...
saw the fear in his eyes.

1319
01:36:57,779 --> 01:37:01,075
And here's my little secret.

1320
01:37:01,115 --> 01:37:04,282
I killed Mufasa.

1321
01:37:10,625 --> 01:37:13,553
No!

1322
01:37:18,166 --> 01:37:19,460
My father!

1323
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:20,561
Your own brother!

1324
01:37:20,601 --> 01:37:21,959
How could you?

1325
01:37:22,003 --> 01:37:23,827
First he kills Mufasa...

1326
01:37:24,038 --> 01:37:25,633
and now he wants to kill me!

1327
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:27,068
You killed him!

1328
01:37:27,108 --> 01:37:28,503
Tell them the truth!

1329
01:37:28,543 --> 01:37:30,238
Don't believe his lies!

1330
01:37:30,278 --> 01:37:31,606
Scar...

1331
01:37:31,646 --> 01:37:35,143
you told us you didn't get
to the gorge in time.

1332
01:37:35,283 --> 01:37:36,644
That's true!

1333
01:37:36,684 --> 01:37:40,147
Then how did you see
the look in Mufasa's eyes?

1334
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:43,286
Murderer!

1335
01:37:43,658 --> 01:37:45,425
Kill them all!

1336
01:37:51,966 --> 01:37:53,756
Lions, attack!

1337
01:38:08,316 --> 01:38:10,311
Simba!

1338
01:38:15,690 --> 01:38:18,891
- Pumbaa, I think we lost them.
- That was terrifying.

1339
01:38:19,994 --> 01:38:21,955
Do you hear a low growl?

1340
01:38:22,497 --> 01:38:25,193
Looks like we'll be
having pig for dinner.

1341
01:38:25,233 --> 01:38:27,501
Plump and chubby.

1342
01:38:27,735 --> 01:38:29,229
Chubby?

1343
01:38:29,337 --> 01:38:31,399
- Did he just call me chubby?
- Oh.

1344
01:38:31,439 --> 01:38:34,068
It sounded a lot like
hejust said "chubby'."

1345
01:38:34,108 --> 01:38:36,037
Which would be
a mistake because...

1346
01:38:36,077 --> 01:38:38,406
I will not be made to feel
ashamed of who I am!

1347
01:38:38,446 --> 01:38:39,507
Oh, boy.

1348
01:38:39,547 --> 01:38:41,476
I may run from hyenas...

1349
01:38:41,516 --> 01:38:43,909
but I will always fight a bully!

1350
01:38:52,126 --> 01:38:53,554
- You feel better, Pumbaa?
- I do.

1351
01:38:53,594 --> 01:38:54,689
You got that out of your system?

1352
01:38:54,729 --> 01:38:56,029
I did.

1353
01:39:10,278 --> 01:39:13,911
Now, this is a meal
I've waited my whole life for.

1354
01:39:14,449 --> 01:39:16,878
I've been waiting too.

1355
01:39:16,918 --> 01:39:19,186
And I'm not a cub anymore!

1356
01:39:24,058 --> 01:39:26,451
For king and country!

1357
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:29,957
It's the bird!

1358
01:39:29,997 --> 01:39:31,696
I got him! I got him!

1359
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:34,395
Tally-ho!

1360
01:39:34,435 --> 01:39:35,563
Oh! No! He's got me!

1361
01:39:35,603 --> 01:39:37,097
He's got me!

1362
01:39:39,941 --> 01:39:41,841
Get that bird!

1363
01:39:46,314 --> 01:39:49,048
Please! Let's discuss this.

1364
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:23,010
That never gets old!

1365
01:41:35,056 --> 01:41:36,550
It's over, Scar.

1366
01:41:40,294 --> 01:41:41,923
Have mercy. I beg you.

1367
01:41:41,963 --> 01:41:43,524
Mercy?

1368
01:41:43,564 --> 01:41:45,161
After what you did?

1369
01:41:45,299 --> 01:41:47,228
It was the hyenas.

1370
01:41:47,268 --> 01:41:49,934
Those revolting scavengers
made me do it.

1371
01:41:53,274 --> 01:41:55,064
You fooled the hyenas.

1372
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:57,568
Just like you fooled me.

1373
01:42:00,281 --> 01:42:01,709
Simba...

1374
01:42:01,749 --> 01:42:04,176
you wouldn't kill
your only uncle.

1375
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:07,046
No, Scar.

1376
01:42:08,489 --> 01:42:10,347
I'm not like you.

1377
01:42:10,925 --> 01:42:15,256
Oh, Simba...
you are truly noble.

1378
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:17,124
And I will make it up to you.

1379
01:42:17,164 --> 01:42:20,194
Just tell me how
I can prove myself.

1380
01:42:20,234 --> 01:42:23,094
Tell me what you want me to do.

1381
01:42:25,072 --> 01:42:26,634
Run.

1382
01:42:28,743 --> 01:42:31,136
Run away, Scar.

1383
01:42:31,412 --> 01:42:34,772
Run away and never return.

1384
01:42:36,083 --> 01:42:37,714
Yes.

1385
01:42:38,185 --> 01:42:40,476
Of course.

1386
01:42:40,921 --> 01:42:44,818
As you wish... Your Majesty.

1387
01:42:57,271 --> 01:42:58,833
You can't win, Scar!

1388
01:42:58,873 --> 01:43:00,468
This is my kingdom!

1389
01:43:00,508 --> 01:43:02,070
My destiny!

1390
01:43:54,995 --> 01:43:56,390
My friends.

1391
01:43:56,430 --> 01:43:57,892
It will take some time,

1392
01:43:57,932 --> 01:44:00,528
but together
we will build our army.

1393
01:44:00,568 --> 01:44:02,233
"Friends"?

1394
01:44:02,436 --> 01:44:06,233
I thought you said we were
"revolting scavengers"?

1395
01:44:06,273 --> 01:44:09,336
Yeah.
That you wanted to kill us?

1396
01:44:09,376 --> 01:44:10,471
No.

1397
01:44:10,511 --> 01:44:11,971
No, let me explain.

1398
01:44:12,346 --> 01:44:14,842
I was trying to fool him.

1399
01:44:14,882 --> 01:44:16,649
We will rule together!

1400
01:44:17,585 --> 01:44:20,979
There's only one true thing
you ever said, Scar.

1401
01:44:22,957 --> 01:44:27,392
"A hyena's belly...
"is never full."

1402
01:44:33,134 --> 01:44:34,526
No!

1403
01:45:27,288 --> 01:45:29,613
Your Majesty.

1404
01:46:23,244 --> 01:46:25,671
