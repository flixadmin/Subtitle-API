1
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,768
There's no respect.
I couldn't even grab the cigarettes.

2
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,801
I'm gonna shoot every fucking hostage
in the head. That's right.

3
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,086
Who's doing this?

4
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,886
Carrillo and Search Bloc, I'm sure of it.

5
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,646
- In the middle of our negotiations?
- Either Gaviria is trying to catch me...

6
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,527
...or Carrillo doesn't give a shit
about the negotiations.

7
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,883
You know what we have to do, Pablo.
We have to close the deal fast...

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,247
before they find us and kill us.

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,646
Not before we build our own jail.

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,288
And that fucking pussy president
will have to agree to that,

11
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,250
even if I have to stick a bomb up his ass.

12
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,244
It's so fucking cold.
Is there a jacket there for me?

13
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,766
- Check it out, fag.
- What's up?

14
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,368
It's a miniskirt with your name on it.

15
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,761
- "Gustavo Gaviria."
- Give me that.

16
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,722
All right, let's call the boys.

17
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,811
And what about you?
Are you all right?

18
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,689
If Gaviria'd let us put US boots
on the ground,

19
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,888
we would've caught the son of a bitch
in five minutes.

20
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,123
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
Escobar is a lot smarter than he looks.

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,282
- Oh, shit.
- Hold on, hold on!

22
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,170
We picked up a signal in the woods
surrounding the target area.

23
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,208
OK, boys, we're in the clear.

24
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,045
Pick us up at El Mariano pass.

25
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,761
- We got new Escobar coordinates.
- Smarter than he looks, huh?

26
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,444
Yeah, don't count your chickens just yet.

27
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,609
We have a tracking signal
on the phone presumed to be Escobar's,

28
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,728
five clicks from the finca.

29
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,690
Request Colombian units to be sent ASAP.

30
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,205
Search Bloc,

31
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,921
we are registering the latitude
and longitude at a fixed point.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,606
The subject appears
to have stopped moving.

33
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,928
You've gotta be shitting me.

34
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,649
I know.

35
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,442
He got away.

36
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,687
Again.

37
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,245
- Shh.
- You hear what I said?

38
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,563
Come on.

39
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,531
Yeah, I'm a little preoccupied, Steve.

40
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,921
I think she's got colic.

41
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,086
What is that?

42
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,403
Well, it means she can't sleep,
which means neither can l.

43
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,642
Did you call the orphanages?

44
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,281
You think I could explain the situation
in English, let alone Spanish?

45
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,370
I still don't understand
why you brought her back here.

46
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,090
Well, let's take her to a hospital.

47
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,251
No, Steve, we can't just take her to
a hospital. it's not like a puppy shelter.

48
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,688
Look, I know you're busy, but we've gotta
figure out what we're gonna do with her.

49
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,211
There's a war going on, Connie.

50
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,647
You said it was only
gonna be for a couple of days.

51
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,769
It's already been a week.
What are we doing here?

52
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,528
- Is that my t-shirt?
- We're out of diapers.

53
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,002
Why don't you go get some more before
she shits through your whole closet?

54
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,931
How nice to see
that you have made friends.

55
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,930
Careful, son.
This woman is very clever.

56
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,970
She can grab your gun
and shoot you in the head.

57
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,610
My apologies, boss.

58
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,650
How do you feel?

59
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,327
As well as one might expect.

60
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,124
I need you to record another tape for me.

61
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,290
No.

62
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,926
No, not until you free more hostages.

63
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,081
Maruja is very ill.
Ricardo has an ulcer.

64
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,970
I'm the only one you need to negotiate.

65
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,601
Then why does the Colombian government
keep trying to capture me?

66
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,080
Look...

67
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,764
I admire your bravery very much.

68
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,722
But Gaviria is a piece of shit, and,
with all due respect, so is your father.

69
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,689
And what did you expect?

70
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,762
To get into Congress
like it was nothing?

71
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,048
Without it mattering that you,
in fact, traffic drugs?

72
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,968
I expected respect.

73
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,605
You had respect
when you built homes for the poor.

74
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,488
But when you didn't get that respect
from a herd of egocentric bureaucrats,

75
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,324
you threw a tantrum.

76
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,208
I was going to do marvelous things
for this country.

77
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,169
If I have made myself into a monster,
like all of you say,

78
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,001
that is the fault of people
like your father...

79
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,964
and those politicians "of always."

80
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,329
Those oligarchs and those people

81
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,405
were never going to tolerate
that little paisa from Medellín

82
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:29,328
who had more money
and was more intelligent than all of them.

83
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,291
Yes.

84
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,011
You would have done marvelous things.

85
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,368
And that is the saddest part.

86
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,051
Mr. Escobar has promised
to free two more hostages.

87
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,445
But in exchange, he has asked that you
continue negotiations with transparency.

88
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,321
President Gaviria...
he knows what you are doing.

89
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,721
He knows.

90
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,169
If you insist on trying to capture him
with the help of the Americans...

91
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,410
they're going to kill us all.

92
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,969
You are risking my daughter's life!

93
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,487
No, Nydia, with all due respect,
we are not risking anyone's life.

94
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,366
Our priority is the life of your daughter
and the lives of the rest of the hostages.

95
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,082
But our priority
is also to capture Escobar.

96
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,760
You cannot have both things at once.

97
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,923
Negotiate with Escobar
while trying to capture him?

98
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,646
Do you know what he is demanding?

99
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,968
That we call a constitutional referendum
to abolish extradition.

100
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,366
That he only plead guilty
to having trafficked drugs one time.

101
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,001
And worst of all,
he wants to build his own jail

102
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,448
and have his own guards
to watch over him.

103
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,921
This is a deal with the devil.

104
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,444
You are the president of a country
that became a living hell some time ago.

105
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,889
With whom else did you expect
to be making a deal?

106
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,971
Gaviria could easier
cut a hundred deals with the devil

107
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,327
before he could cut one with Pablo.

108
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,007
Bowing to Pablo's demands
was political suicide.

109
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,926
So, he did what politicians do best:
he stalled.

110
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,561
He kept our planes in the air
and prayed to God that we got a hit.

111
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,290
Hello. it's Gorilla.

112
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,530
Ground units,
begin trilateration for signal origin.

113
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,525
And when we did, it was
not the hit that we were hoping for.

114
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,690
Forgive me, Gorilla, I don't feel well.

115
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,771
Miss Diana...

116
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,606
why are you so unpleasant with the boss?

117
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,404
You are loyal like a sheep,
aren't you?

118
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:57,371
That man is your kidnapper... and mine,
and that of the whole nation.

119
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,010
Here, you go first.

120
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,248
Hide in here, quickly!

121
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,284
Who would've thought a failed raid
would result in Escobar's biggest victory?

122
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,285
Pablo didn't even have
to pull the trigger. We did it for him.

123
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,846
Guys, we have a problem.

124
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,407
For the battle-fatigued
citizens of Colombia,

125
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,245
Diana's death was the final straw.

126
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,687
This wasn't just an oligarch dying.

127
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,243
Her presence on the nation's TV screens
and in their homes transcended class.

128
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,361
The people were devastated.

129
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,240
For President Gaviria,
there was little room left to move.

130
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,562
Mr. President!

131
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,324
You killed my daughter.

132
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,846
Let her pass.

133
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,530
Wait...

134
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,847
if you had accepted his terms,
my daughter would still be alive!

135
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,241
Give him whatever he wants.

136
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,001
Don't let others go through the suffering
we've had to endure.

137
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,651
Mr. President... we need to leave.

138
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,362
God be with you, Nydia.

139
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,962
There's something
I want to make very clear.

140
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,080
You are not to blame for Diana's death.
OK? That has to be clear.

141
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,645
Escobar has the resources
for this to go on forever.

142
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,404
Yes, and so do we.

143
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,084
We are the state.

144
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,000
We are going to fight, do whatever we have
to do, and we are going to finish him.

145
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,691
We have options.

146
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,651
For instance, why don't we allow
the American military to come in?

147
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,566
I know... We don't like it.
I personally don't like it.

148
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,450
But if it's a specific, clear mission...

149
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,760
- No.
- Something covert.

150
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,966
No!

151
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,766
It's time to end all of this.

152
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,482
Give Escobar what he wants.

153
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,211
Let's go.

154
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,004
If your Congress
abolishes extradition, we lose our teeth.

155
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,965
- We're a paper fucking tiger!
- Everything we have done is lost.

156
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,730
We have no choice.

157
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,760
The people, the public... it's tired
of all these bombs and bloodshed!

158
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,365
Right, and business goes as usual,

159
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,727
- he just runs it from that jail.
- Exactly!

160
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,407
All things considered,
it's a victory to put Escobar in jail.

161
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,211
For public relations?

162
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,044
It's capitulation.

163
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,327
You want Escobar.

164
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,129
Why?

165
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,048
Why?

166
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,160
Because you want to parade him
in your DEA jackets?

167
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,242
You think this is a game, right?

168
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,649
This is Colombia,
and our people want peace!

169
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,927
This is not a fucking game!

170
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,249
Well...
at this time, our friend, Fernando,

171
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,085
is going to tell us a little something.

172
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,330
The Colombian government is going
to allow Pablo to turn himself in,

173
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,402
accepting only one simple charge:
drug trafficking.

174
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,608
And...

175
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,967
they are going to let him build a jail

176
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,047
which the police
cannot be within three kilometers of.

177
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,522
At last...
we have liberated ourselves from tyranny!

178
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,968
- Long live Colombia, motherfuckers.
- ¡Viva!

179
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,604
- Fernando...
- Mm?

180
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,805
- ...thank you very much.
- No problem, Pablo.

181
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,647
And do you know when Congress
is going to vote to abolish extradition?

182
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,726
Mm! Yes, it's...
It's a matter of... of weeks.

183
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,600
And at that time, you will be able
to turn yourself over to the authorities.

184
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,162
It pleases me very much to finish my work
with you with such a great victory.

185
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,444
No, brother. Now is when I am
going to need your services the most.

186
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,206
- How... How's that?
- Fernando...

187
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,886
now it's time for us to find legal means
to reduce my sentence even more.

188
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,364
Right?

189
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,571
And what does this mean for us, huh?

190
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:22,727
It means, my love...
that now I have a jail.

191
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,848
And for you,
visiting days will be...

192
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,531
every day.

193
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,206
- I'm serious, Pablo.
- So am l.

194
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,282
The problem, Pablo, is that...

195
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,807
now that you have admitted
to trafficking in narcotics,

196
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,441
my image as a journalist
cannot be associated with yours.

197
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,966
Hm.

198
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,650
So then...

199
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:06,044
now you think I am going to damage your
credibility as a journalist... is that it?

200
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,287
You understand what I'm saying.

201
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,330
Oh, yeah, sure. Of course I do.

202
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:20,963
I think that... it's time for me

203
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:27,002
to set you free, so that...
you can find a boyfriend who's honest...

204
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,371
so that you can get a little house,
have little kids,

205
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,761
- little dogs...
- Don't joke around, Pablo.

206
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,808
No, I'm not joking.

207
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,682
I just want you to know...

208
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,200
that you, Valeria...

209
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,722
are a bandit, just like me.

210
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,043
So don't come to me with bullshit.

211
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,889
Looks like you got away with it,
eh, asshole?

212
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,680
Shit, I'd thought you'd gone crazy.

213
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,120
Geniuses...
are always branded as crazy.

214
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,044
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

215
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,131
- The Ochoas...
- The Ochoas what?

216
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,124
You can bet
they're going to be pissed off.

217
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,089
Because of the treaty?

218
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,164
Or because you're fucking their sister?

219
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,651
That was a stupid mistake, Gustavo.

220
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,891
Let's hope they don't
charge you for it later.

221
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,210
The race was on.

222
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,921
Pablo needed to build his jail
as fast as possible.

223
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,210
As for his enemies, they needed
to get to him before that happened.

224
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,881
As soon as he walked inside,
Pablo would be safe.

225
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,611
And everyone on the outside wouldn't.

226
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,841
We got an official cease
and desist order for any further operation

227
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,207
when Pablo officially surrenders.

228
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,641
- Search Bloc is gonna be disbanded.
- We heard the terms.

229
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,208
- No cops within two miles of the prison.
- This is a fucking sham.

230
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,562
It's a death warrant for my men.

231
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,928
I won't be able to protect them.

232
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,606
I won't let that happen.

233
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,164
There are cops that hate Escobar
just as much as I do.

234
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,725
More.

235
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,041
They're not gonna stop
just because they're told to.

236
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,440
You talking about vigilantes?

237
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,441
Call it what you like... but I'm still
gonna need those intel reports.

238
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,364
- We'll get you anything we find.
- Javi, you gotta cool it with that shit.

239
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,125
They know we've been helping.
One more and we're out.

240
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,004
I thought you said you were all in.

241
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,441
The soccer field will be over here.

242
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,690
Here, I want to have
a little doll house for Manuela,

243
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,164
and downstairs,
a bar with a Jacuzzi for the guys.

244
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,811
My family will live in a house
down the hill.

245
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,050
I'm going to install a telescope
so I can look at them whenever I want.

246
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,084
Yeah, right. More like
you can look at other girls' asses.

247
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,041
No. The family, the family.
To see my kids.

248
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,369
- What can we do to help you, Pablo?
- Well...

249
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,569
while we're in prison,
Gustavo and me,

250
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:19,488
I will count on you, Moncada, and you,
Galeano, to oversee operations.

251
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,845
Thank you, Pablo.

252
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:28,086
We're privileged to be given
that responsibility. You can count on us.

253
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,881
We've already spoken about the operational
plan and everything's clear, right?

254
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,088
Yes. We won't let you down, Pablo.

255
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,442
Did you tell them about the tax?

256
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,881
- No, I didn't.
- The tax?

257
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,928
What tax is this?

258
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,450
Who paid for the war we fought?

259
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,005
You.

260
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,169
- You, Don Pablo.
- That's right.

261
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,086
We have peace now.

262
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,846
You're going to directly
benefit from that.

263
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,210
It's only fair that you contribute
to the legal and security costs

264
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,045
that Gustavo and I will face behind bars.

265
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,770
And about how much will that be?

266
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,482
We agreed to what,
$200,000 a month, right?

267
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,728
Yes, 200 grand.

268
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,041
200 grand?

269
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,045
That's a lot of money, brother.
A lot of money.

270
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,009
But consider it done.

271
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,404
And again... thank you
very much for this responsibility,

272
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,001
- and for considering us.
- All right, then.

273
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,801
Don Pablo. All right. Gustavo.

274
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,487
Do you think that was a smart move, Pablo?

275
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,451
Why should I let them
reap the fruits of our labor

276
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,370
without compensating us for it, Gustavo?

277
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,124
I agree with you.

278
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,570
But right now, we really
need those two fags to be loyal.

279
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,809
And what?
You don't think I inspire loyalty?

280
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,288
My loyalty?
Yes, you know you have it.

281
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,488
But I'm not sure about everyone else's.

282
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,202
You know, the thing is, Pablo...
you won.

283
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,567
There's no arguing that.

284
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,483
But you gave in.

285
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,167
And there are people
who will see that as weakness.

286
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:34,167
We've gotta keep our enemies close,
now more than ever.

287
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,127
Thank you.

288
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,129
It's great to see you again, Valeria.

289
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,801
Likewise, Pacho.
I'm very happy to see you.

290
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,283
Although, I must say...
it was a little unexpected.

291
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,881
We are worried about you.

292
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,088
And... why are "we" worried?

293
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,489
Pablo's cutting a deal
with the government.

294
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,528
He's going to have
to admit to certain things.

295
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,009
Things that may damage
your reputation by association.

296
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,771
If I'm good at anything,
it's protecting my reputation.

297
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,930
Listen, this time it's different.

298
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,405
Look... you helped create
that "Robin Hood Paisa" bullshit.

299
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,049
And when it all goes to shit, you'll have
to take responsibility for that.

300
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,004
Maybe he tricked me, too.
Like the rest of the world.

301
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,208
You have enemies, see?

302
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,169
They're not gonna
let you get away with it.

303
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,362
Look, Valeria...

304
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:50,049
we have a lot of connections in New York,
a strong presence, you could say.

305
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,323
You should go there,
at least for a little while.

306
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,811
And leave Colombia.

307
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,049
There are a million Colombians there.

308
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,885
A new audience.

309
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,009
And they don't care if you shared your bed
with a monster or not.

310
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,200
Just for a while.

311
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,403
When this is all over, you'll be able to
come back here with your head held high,

312
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,568
I guarantee it.

313
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,566
And not only that, you'll have earned
a brand-new audience in the United States.

314
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,520
- Betrayal is not my style.
- What betrayal?

315
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,364
And what would you be betraying?

316
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,648
Your role as his mistress?

317
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:40,846
You remain loyal to a man who has never
thought you're good enough to be his wife.

318
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,605
His wife? Me?

319
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,331
No, no, no,
you're very much mistaken, my dear.

320
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,408
The last thing I want
is to be married to him.

321
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,683
Besides...
do you think I'd want to be his wife?

322
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,205
Do you think I want to be locked up,
waiting all day at the Monaco building,

323
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,089
while he's out with...

324
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,725
with me?

325
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,851
No.

326
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,007
That's too boring.

327
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,008
I missed you so much.

328
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,844
I missed you, too.

329
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,883
No, it was terrible.

330
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,404
It was terrible.

331
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,211
Every day in a different house...

332
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,048
worried about you...

333
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,124
the kids...

334
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,485
The truth is...

335
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,010
it's very good to be home.

336
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,644
- You look happy.
- Of course.

337
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,928
That time has passed.

338
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,569
It's the happiest face I've ever seen
on a man about to go to jail.

339
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,327
- The kids!
- The kids, Pablo!

340
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,765
- The kids!
- No, Tata!

341
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,002
- I have to go to them!
- Stay here!

342
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,606
- My children!
- Stay here!

343
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,887
I'll go get them. Stay here.

344
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,046
Juan Pablo!

345
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,844
Juan Pablo!

346
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,809
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

347
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,166
Come on.

348
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,849
Go to your mother.
Go to your mother.

349
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,970
Come on, come on.

350
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,523
The explosion was
from a car bomb on the street below,

351
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,967
about 800 pounds' worth of dynamite.

352
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,805
It made little Manuela
forever deaf in one ear.

353
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,207
In this war,

354
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,011
the innocent always seemed
to be the ones who got hurt.

355
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,327
For Escobar, the Monaco bombing
told him two things:

356
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,771
First, it showed him that the cops
weren't his biggest problem.

357
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,049
They would never use a bomb.

358
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,729
This was a new player, one that
wasn't above going after his family.

359
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,642
Don't worry, cousin.

360
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,962
We're going to kill them all.

361
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,367
Second, and the one
that fucked with his head the most...

362
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:02,006
was that for the first time in his life...
someone had given him up.

363
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,247
And worse yet,
he had no idea who.

364
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,766
Hello?

365
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,401
Valeria, there was an attempted hit
at the Monaco building.

366
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,327
- Just now?
- Yes, a few minutes ago. A car bomb.

367
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,722
- Who was inside?
- We don't know.

368
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,928
What other information do you have?

369
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,010
That's all the information
we have right now.

370
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,809
OK, thanks.

371
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,927
He always takes her to the same motel.

372
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,962
- Marina.
- Where are you going?

373
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,482
I'm going to the city.

374
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,767
I have to get out of this prison.

375
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,570
- Come here, Marina.
- Yes?

376
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,164
Have a good time.

377
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,083
Be safe.

378
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,485
Thanks.

379
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,367
You know what he's going to do, right?

380
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,886
He's going to continue conducting
his business behind those walls

381
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,487
that are protected
by the Colombian government.

382
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,450
We should give him credit.
The man is a genius.

383
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,570
Well... all the more reason
that we should negotiate our surrender.

384
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,128
But you know that Pablo
took it upon himself to close that door.

385
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,328
So we need to take advantage
of your political contacts,

386
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,006
especially General Jaramillo.

387
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,649
Can you talk to him for us?

388
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,161
Yes, of course.

389
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,846
But I don't think it will be enough.

390
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,206
What are you saying?

391
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,443
That you're going
to have to offer something more,

392
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,281
something that interests them enough
to make a deal with you.

393
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,844
Gustavo Gaviria.

394
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,641
He is the key to Pablo's business.

395
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,007
If that son of a bitch goes down,
the whole empire goes down.

396
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,763
Indeed, that could work.

397
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,685
That could work.

398
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,282
It is often said
there is no honor among thieves.

399
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,045
That's doubly true of drug dealers.

400
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,841
The Ochoas, with the help of Cali,
made their own surrender deal.

401
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,010
No extradition, no stiff sentence.

402
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,766
The Colombian government
was willing to overlook their part

403
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,284
in the largest cocaine empire
on the face of the earth.

404
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,840
Instead, they would
serve reduced sentences.

405
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,968
- The charge?
- Follow me.

406
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,011
Illegally importing bulls from Spain.
I shit you not.

407
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,811
They went to jail
with smiles on their faces,

408
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,451
'cause all they had to do
was use their sister as bait

409
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,524
to catch a fish the cops actually wanted.

410
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,129
Kiss me.

411
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,727
- You look pretty, baby.
- Yeah, sure.

412
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,889
What I mean is
you've always looked pretty.

413
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,730
Gustavo.

414
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,370
What's happening?

415
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,845
Nothing.

416
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,766
Nothing is happening here.
Isn't that right, Colonel Carrillo?

417
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,729
That's up to you.

418
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,124
- Say goodbye.
- No.

419
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,487
No, no, no.
Gustavo, look at me. Gustav...

420
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,324
Does your family know where you are?

421
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,129
- Gustavo!
- Calm down, Marina.

422
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:00,366
You're making a big mistake, Carrillo.

423
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,571
We're already in negotiations
with the government.

424
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,962
- You have no reason to be doing this.
- You're right.

425
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,489
That's why I'm not here.

426
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,482
Then what the fuck do you want?

427
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,288
Don't act stupid.

428
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,404
Give me your cousin...
and I'll let you live.

429
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,890
All right.

430
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,961
Kill me, then, motherfucker.

431
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,003
I won't do that myself.

432
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:48,122
But I want to introduce you to some people
who would love to do it for me.

433
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,283
This guy? This is Lastia.

434
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,245
His sister died in a bookstore in Bogotá
in a bombing you coordinated.

435
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,368
She was 17 years old.

436
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,289
And this guy here...

437
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,649
this is Trujillo.

438
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,322
You killed his father
and his brother for being cops.

439
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,364
- That has nothing to do with me.
- No?

440
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,490
You know...
if you support evil, you are evil.

441
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,324
Look at them.

442
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,927
I just want you to look at their faces.

443
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,283
A few of the victims
you've left in your wake.

444
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,011
Tell me...

445
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,482
have you ever felt
the swift vengeance of justice?

446
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,241
Give me your cousin...

447
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,006
or I'll let these men
show you that vengeance with their fists.

448
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,450
Do it, then...
you sons of bitches.

449
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,210
OK, then.

450
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:22,846
We'll see how you feel...
after ten minutes.

451
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,525
Do it.

452
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,246
Tell me where your cousin is.

453
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,845
It doesn't have to end like this.

454
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,127
Tell me where your cousin is.

455
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,885
We...

456
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:33,926
are bandits...
not snitches, motherfucker.

457
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,125
You're...
You're all gonna die, motherfuckers!

458
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,684
You're all dead, motherfuckers!

459
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:06,767
You, your families,
your wives are all dead, motherfuckers!

460
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,046
You're all dead!

461
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,049
Dump his body on the road to Sabaneta.

462
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,771
Colonel, they're going
to make us pay for this.

463
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:24,007
Report his death as a result
of a shoot-out with the police.

464
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,765
Make sure you report that he fired first.

465
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,928
But Colonel, he's all beat up.

466
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,609
That work for you?

467
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:55,604
There is nothing... more beautiful
and more important in my life than this.

468
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,761
We're all here together... united.

469
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,485
Now let's eat and enjoy
this marvelous food.

470
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,410
- Wait, wait.
- Oh, yeah, the beets.

471
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,841
- Tata?
- Boss?

472
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,205
Hello, son. Have a seat.

473
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,250
- Sit down...
- Boss, I don't know how to say this.

474
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,565
Tell me like a man.

475
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,762
- Gustavo is dead.
- What?

476
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,405
They found his body on the outskirts
of Sabaneta, badly beaten.

477
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,409
How's that?

478
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,051
They also shot him, boss.

479
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,244
No, no!
How dare you come to my house saying that!

480
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,484
How dare you!
Leave! Get out of my house!

481
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:51,281
You... you are leaving right now!
Get out of my house! Go on!

482
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,921
No! Gustavo, no. Pablo...
Go on! Get out of here!

483
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,324
It's OK.
Everything's going to be fine.

484
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,842
Are you sure about this?

485
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,926
Yes, boss.

486
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,966
I want you to take him
to the funeral home...

487
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,129
and guard his body the entire time
until it's buried.

488
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,924
- All right.
- Go on.

489
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,328
How are you doing, son?

490
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,880
I'm going to miss him so much, Mama.

491
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,531
When...

492
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:37,763
you were nine... or ten...
do you remember?

493
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,970
How you would
ride around on your bicycles.

494
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,161
You'd go up into the mountains
and just disappear.

495
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:53,086
The whole day would go by...

496
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,850
Oh, my.

497
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,922
And we would call you...

498
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,081
We seemed crazy,
yelling for you all over the place...

499
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,724
until finally you would appear.

500
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,162
Oh, my God.

501
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,367
"Where were you?"

502
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,682
"Where have you been, son?"
I would yell out.

503
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,766
"In the mountains, Mama."

504
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:34,371
"Higher than the clouds, Auntie,"
Gustavo would say, laughing.

505
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,124
He...

506
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,771
He always wanted to go farther.

507
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,167
He always did.

508
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,641
But with you.

509
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,682
Only with you.

510
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,450
I didn't think it would end this way.

511
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,569
Good afternoon.

512
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,321
Boss? Someone came
all the way out here to see you.

513
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,683
Miss Valeria.

514
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,170
Good day, ma'am. Pablo.

515
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,530
What's she doing here?

516
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,524
I'm here only because
I have important information.

517
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,090
I hope it's very important.

518
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,760
It's about Gustavo.

519
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,730
Tell us, then.

520
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,448
I've been told the Ochoa brothers
have been seen in Cali.

521
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,723
They are the ones
who turned Gustavo over,

522
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,486
in exchange for the cartel helping them
seal a deal with the government.

523
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,891
How do you know that?

524
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,560
You know me, Pablo.

525
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,324
I have my ways.

526
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,641
Who in Cali?

527
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,560
Pacho Herrera.

528
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,170
Pablo wanted to send a message to Cali,

529
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,404
so he ordered his sicarios
to hit them during a soccer match.

530
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,848
It was very effective.

531
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,451
He did get 14 Cali men that day.

532
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,725
The problem was, everyone on
the soccer field was dressed the same.

533
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,691
By the time the sicarios spotted Pacho,

534
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,524
he was already running away.

535
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,000
"Will you hide yourself forever, Lord?

536
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,090
Will your wrath burn like fire?

537
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,209
Remember how fleeting is my life,

538
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,683
for what futility
you have created the children of men."

539
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,969
Pablo had Gustavo
buried in the hills of Medellín,

540
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,247
where the cousins had played as kids.

541
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,970
In his mind,
losing his best friend

542
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,567
was a price he had to pay
to defeat extradition.

543
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,122
So he ordered the burial
to take place at the exact same time

544
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,443
that Congress was voting to repeal it.

545
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:12,969
Whether it was Gaviria's support,
Pablo's "plata or plomo,"

546
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,651
or maybe people
were just sick of the violence...

547
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,083
extradition was defeated by a landslide.

548
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,611
Hours after the vote,
a military helicopter

549
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,763
was dispatched to coordinates
just outside Medellín,

550
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,047
where Pablo was waiting.

551
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,444
As you know,
I come on behalf of President Gaviria

552
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,681
and the Colombian government.

553
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:48,408
This is the offer of our terms
for your surrender.

554
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,729
Peña and I
had to go see it with our own eyes.

555
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,089
A terrorist, a drug dealer and a murderer
surrendering to a grateful nation

556
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,130
who gave him everything he asked for.

557
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,330
It was the closest we'd ever come to him,
and we never felt further away.

558
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,203
All right, then.

559
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,484
Let me hand over my gun.

560
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,563
- You won.
- We both did.

561
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,010
Now Gaviria can announce
that Pablo Escobar has turned himself in.

562
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,409
Except that's not so true.

563
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,721
You and I know it's a big lie.

564
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,570
Mm.

565
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:38,644
Lies are necessary... when the truth
is too difficult to believe. Right?

566
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,327
It wasn't a fucking surrender.

567
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,330
Pablo wasn't succumbing to justice.

568
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:53,050
He was escaping it.
And all anyone could do was watch.

569
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,169
Once again, Escobar had used violence
to bend the world to his will.

570
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:08,409
They called it "Ia gran mentira,"
"the big lie."

571
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,687
And it was a lie.

572
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,325
Except as I watched him
fly away to his luxury prison...

573
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,008
I couldn't help but think
there was some truth in it.

574
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,447
Damn it. Fucker.

575
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,330
A truth that I hadn't
been willing to accept.

576
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,607
He'd beat us because
he was willing to do what we weren't.

577
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,042
Bad guys don't play by the rules.

578
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,683
That's what makes 'em bad.

579
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,127
Maybe that's what lets 'em win.

580
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,965
Lagarto,
are we gonna party tonight or what?

581
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,567
I got Poison at 400
to 1700 megahertz, gentlemen.

582
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,728
La Dispensaria.

583
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,047
So who do we give this to? DEA?

584
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,562
- Yeah. Let's give it to Javier Peña.
- Peña's an asshole.

585
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,529
- I'm gonna give it to the other guy.
- Sure.

586
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,483
I made a promise to myself
that when the time came

587
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,801
that I could strike a blow
against Escobar,

588
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,003
even if it meant breaking the rules,
oh, I was gonna do it.

589
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,163
- Hello?
- Hey, Central Spike here.

590
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,964
All right.

591
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,203
You wanna tell me a good guy
wouldn't have pushed the buttons

592
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,930
on these motherfuckers?

593
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,967
You wanna call me a bad guy?

594
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:39,769
Fine. But if you do, it just means
that you haven't met enough bad guys yet

595
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,046
to know the difference.

596
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,404
There's one thing I've learned
down here in Colombia,

597
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,802
good and bad are relative concepts.
