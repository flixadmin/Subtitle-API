1
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:11,095
Hello, this is J.K. Simmons.

2
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:13,890
Actually, this is J.K. Simmons
and that is Tobey Maguire.

3
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:15,766
Tobey Maguire.

4
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:20,188
Gonna watch Spider-Man
and talk to you guys.

5
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:23,983
Yeah. And that was
the Columbia lady shedding light.

6
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:26,402
Very cool logo.

7
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:30,281
Marvel Comics. I thought it was
part of the movie when I first saw it.

8
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:33,075
It's just the Marvel logo.

9
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,668
And very cool Danny Elf man...

10
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:44,128
- Score.
- ...theme here, yeah.

11
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:45,755
Yeah.

12
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:52,803
I remember sitting at the premier...

13
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,807
...really remember
just right off the bat just being...

14
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,851
...sucked right in.

15
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:01,395
Oh, yeah. It was so exciting too.

16
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,857
The energy and anticipation
of the film was just insane.

17
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,067
- Yeah.
- It was...

18
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:08,778
I was like on the edge
of my seat and...

19
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:13,157
...I couldn't wait to see
how people responded.

20
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:30,925
- "J.K. Simmons."
- Hey, I heard of him.

21
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:32,426
Yeah.

22
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,054
I've worked with him before actually.

23
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:37,390
- Right, there's a little trivia fact.
- Sure.

24
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,850
<i>Cider House Rules.</i>

25
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:44,522
- Played Charlize's pops, right?
- Yeah.

26
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:45,940
I can't remember his name.

27
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:47,942
- The lobster man. Ray.
- Right.

28
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:50,403
Ray, the lobster man.

29
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,711
I gotta say, I had a great time
on this film...

30
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:09,338
...and it comes from Sam.
Sam Raimi.

31
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:11,048
Absolutely. Yeah.

32
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:12,591
He was...

33
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,927
It was hard for me
to get this job actually.

34
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:19,181
The studio was hesitant
to hire me...

35
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:22,601
...as this is a huge investment
for them...

36
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:26,022
...and, you know, I guess people
are used to seeing me...

37
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,898
...in art-house films...

38
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:32,778
...playing more passive,
less heroic characters...

39
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:35,906
...very introspective, and...

40
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,451
They didn't...

41
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,536
They said,
"Well, we like him as an actor.

42
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:42,872
We're not sure if he's right
for this role."

43
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,833
And Sam Raimi really fought for me.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,461
And it was hard.
I had to fight with him...

45
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,464
...but he was so supportive
and so passionate...

46
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,549
...about having me in the movie.

47
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:58,179
You know, I went through
two screen tests...

48
00:02:58,346 --> 00:03:00,056
...for the film.

49
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,477
And then off to the races...

50
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,938
...but it was good
because I really felt...

51
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,357
...like a partner with Sam.

52
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,109
- Yeah.
- So it was a good way to go into it.

53
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:16,113
And then just having a ball with Sam
making the movie.

54
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,074
He's so much fun, so funny.

55
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,409
Yeah, yeah, he's great. He's...

56
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:23,788
I described him once as being like...

57
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,791
...a really, really smart 9-year-old boy.

58
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:30,211
Because he's got a lot of
that kind of fun about him.

59
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:33,964
Fun, silly energy, but very smart
and very collaborative.

60
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,132
Yeah.

61
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,635
There's Kirsten Dunst,
who I flew out to Germany...

62
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:39,470
...when I had strep throat.

63
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:41,722
We had read tons of girls
and we were like...

64
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,058
...four weeks before
we started shooting.

65
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,519
And, you know,
that's a short amount of time...

66
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,230
...for this kind of film,
where they have all these...

67
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:52,316
I mean, she didn't have
a superhero costume...

68
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:54,527
...but, you know,
they need preparation time.

69
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:55,820
Right.

70
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,697
And I didn't wanna go.

71
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,075
And I said to Sam...

72
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,494
Didn't wanna spend eight hours
on a plane with strep?

73
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:06,205
Yeah, I didn't. Well, actually
I had to go to New York.

74
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:08,624
<i>From LA. To New York...</i>

75
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:12,628
No, L.A. to Germany for...

76
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:15,714
...17 hours, be in Germany, Berlin...

77
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,633
...then go to New York
for two days...

78
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,969
...and come home.
And I called my doctor...

79
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:24,682
...and said, "Can you give me a note
so I can call Sam...

80
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:28,102
...or give the note that I can't go
to Sam?" And I called...

81
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:30,312
"Dear Mr. Raimi, Tobey is too sick..."

82
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,942
And I called Sam and I said, you know,
"My doctor doesn't think I should go."

83
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:38,320
Sam said, "Tobey...

84
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,990
...I've gotta tell my kids that...

85
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:43,117
...Daddy can't be with them
this weekend...

86
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:47,204
...and I really don't wanna do that.
This is about sacrifice.

87
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:50,708
And pack your bags
because you're coming to Germany."

88
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:54,879
So off we went,
and thank God, because that was it.

89
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,506
I mean, I'm not gonna say,
you know...

90
00:04:57,882 --> 00:05:00,551
We basically all knew
right as it was happening...

91
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:02,386
- Yeah, yeah.
- ...that she was it.

92
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:04,388
She was so...

93
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:09,977
There were a lot of wonderful names
and ideas that came up for casting...

94
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:14,064
...but then, yeah, when I met Kirsten
and saw her doing it, there's just...

95
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,609
Nobody could have been any better.

96
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,360
For the role, yeah, exactly.

97
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:21,405
...Public-school kids.
I'm not showing up in the Rolls.

98
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:23,908
What, you want me
to trade in my car for a Jetta...

99
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,494
...because you flunked out
of every private school...

100
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,204
And these guys...

101
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:31,832
Willem and James Franco.

102
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,710
One of the great things
that you notice...

103
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:36,712
...in the very first scene is that...

104
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,423
...you see actors playing
father and son all the time...

105
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,675
...that there's no way
they could be related.

106
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,427
And these guys, you know...

107
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:46,055
...not only are they both
good actors...

108
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:47,389
...but they actually...

109
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,266
- Look like...
- They could be related.

110
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:50,434
Exactly.

111
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,354
Good job.

112
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:57,107
There I am, looking like a nerd.

113
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,943
It's perfect.

114
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,320
So was that a big stretch,
the nerd thing?

115
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:05,616
Well, it is a big stretch,
but people don't realize that.

116
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:08,118
Only my friends realize that.

117
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,122
Impressive.
Your parents must be very proud.

118
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,124
I live with my aunt and uncle.
They are.

119
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,293
It was great working with Willem.
I like...

120
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,797
I think I threw <i>in the DVD
of Last Temptation of Christ...</i>

121
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:22,341
...the night before I started
working with him.

122
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:25,886
You know, I said, "I'm going to work
with Jesus Christ tomorrow."

123
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,429
Right.

124
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:31,517
He had just gotten done...
The vampire...

125
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:34,311
- What <i>was the vampire movie?
- Shadow of the Vampire.</i>

126
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,690
That was just out when we...
When I started working with him.

127
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,149
Yup.

128
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,944
This is the most advanced electron
microscope...

129
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,738
Peter Parker,
impressed with things...

130
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,241
...that most teenagers
couldn't care less about.

131
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:49,243
That's what most teenagers
care about.

132
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,911
Yeah, exactly.

133
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:57,501
For example, the Delena spider,
family Sparassidae, has the ability...

134
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,838
This is very typical...

135
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,842
...you know, sweet, smart,
underdog character...

136
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:06,719
...and getting picked on here.

137
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,679
- Right. And big, mean Joe.
- Right.

138
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,764
Flash Thompson.

139
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:14,018
That's the other thing about this,
I had such a good time...

140
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,978
...because everybody in the film...

141
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:19,481
...like these guys, were great
and they were a lot of fun.

142
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:23,068
And I just say, that all comes
from Sam again, in my opinion.

143
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,320
Yeah. Yeah.

144
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,281
I was gonna say... This is
the Sam Raimi butt-kissing hour...

145
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:28,532
...but it's really true.

146
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:31,577
You know, he does
a great job of hiring...

147
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:35,039
...not only people who are gonna be
really good at their job...

148
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:39,043
...but people that, you know,
you can spend a few months with...

149
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,837
...and really collaborate with
and have a good time with.

150
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:46,216
The whole process before we started
shooting, for a couple months...

151
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:49,470
I mean, I trained physically
for four or five months...

152
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:52,139
...but the whole process
of getting in a room...

153
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:55,142
...with the different actors
and Sam...

154
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:58,729
And we would go through,
scene by scene...

155
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:01,940
...and break down the scenes
and what they meant...

156
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:05,736
...for our characters,
and what place they had in the film...

157
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:08,155
...and in our characters' arcs...

158
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,533
...was a great process because
it gets us all on the same page...

159
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,079
...and we're all going in to make
the same movie with the same tone.

160
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,123
And we all felt like...

161
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,210
...we were partners
in making the film.

162
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:25,756
We were filmmakers and not just
hired puppets to come in and...

163
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:28,550
- Come in and say the lines. Yeah.
- Right.

164
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,762
So that's always nice
because I can see my...

165
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:34,973
You know, my handprint
on the movie here and there...

166
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,811
...beyond just my performance,
which is a lot of fun.

167
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,771
Yeah, it was really a very...

168
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:44,942
Especially considering the big-budget,
blockbuster nature of it...

169
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:50,114
...it was a very collaborative,
supportive, fun kind of project.

170
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,700
...Genetically designed super-spiders.

171
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,451
There's 14.

172
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,286
I beg your pardon?

173
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,997
- One's missing.
- Yeah.

174
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,545
I guess the researchers
are working on that one.

175
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,674
There's James snaking my girl.

176
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:14,012
You were talking throughout
that woman's entire presentation.

177
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,931
Let's go talk about how we listen.

178
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:22,646
- Come on, go for it.
- Yeah.

179
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,692
Getting the nerve.

180
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:29,445
I think that's a moment
that we can all identify with...

181
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,989
- ...from adolescent days or beyond.
- Absolutely.

182
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:35,659
Well, I do wanna say that
this is acting for me at this point.

183
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,164
- Sure.
- Great.

184
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,541
Where do you want me? Over here?

185
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,084
Yeah, that's great.

186
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,170
Don't make me look ugly.

187
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,714
She's great. She's just so natural.

188
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:53,510
So believable and solid,
but fun and funny.

189
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:56,847
Something I love is,
she doesn't work with vanity...

190
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,600
...and she's not...
She doesn't really care, you know.

191
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:02,478
She's not, like, cautious or vain...

192
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:06,148
...or looking at herself, self-conscious.
She just goes for it and...

193
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:08,650
...is there
to have a good time and...

194
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:11,612
Oh, here's the one.

195
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:15,115
Here's the little guy
that sets the whole mess in motion.

196
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,201
What is in this thing?

197
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,161
What is in that little guy?

198
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,872
By the way, that wasn't my hand.

199
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,373
That was not my thumbnail.

200
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,210
And I know I'm blowing
the magic of movies there...

201
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,629
...but that was not my thumbnail.

202
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,300
So a hand model got a day at work?

203
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,885
I don't know who that was.

204
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:37,888
- That was probably Sam. Yeah.
- Sam Raimi.

205
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,139
Now see that thumbnail?

206
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,642
- Oh, that's not...?
- That's mine.

207
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:43,894
How strange.

208
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,278
"New species."

209
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:57,491
OSCORP, the empire of evil.

210
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:01,245
We solved the horizon glide
and the multi-G balance issues.

211
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:04,957
I feel bad things for this guy.

212
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,751
Something's gonna happen.

213
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,297
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.

214
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:14,383
- Norman.
- Mr. Osborn.

215
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,095
Always a pleasure to have
our board of directors visit.

216
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:21,723
I want to see the progress report
on human performance enhancers.

217
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,395
We tried vapor inhalation with rats.
Their strength increased by 800%.

218
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:28,438
- Excellent.
- Any side effects?

219
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,690
In one trial, yes.

220
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:32,526
An aberration. All the tests since
have been successful.

221
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,778
In Mr. Osborn's defense, you know...

222
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:37,281
...this guy could be
a little more understanding...

223
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,907
...a little more compassionate.

224
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:41,451
They're working on
some pretty serious stuff.

225
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:45,247
The military is known
for their compassion...

226
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:47,666
- ...and understanding.
- Absolutely.

227
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,418
Very empathetic.

228
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,462
Let's talk it out.

229
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,173
We need to take the whole line
back to formula.

230
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,636
- Back to formula?
- Dr. Osborn.

231
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,639
I'll be frank with you.

232
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:07,728
I never supported your program. We
have my predecessor to thank for that.

233
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,647
The general has approved
Quest Aerospace...

234
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:13,734
...to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton design.

235
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,654
- They test in two weeks.
- And if your performance enhancers...

236
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:21,867
...have not had a successful
human trial by that date...

237
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:23,493
...I'm gonna pull your funding.

238
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,829
One of the conversations
I had with Sam early on...

239
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:29,082
...before I even knew
if I wanted to do the film...

240
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,127
...was, you know,
what's the tone of this film gonna be?

241
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:33,337
Is it gonna...?

242
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:36,131
Are we gonna try to make it
as believable as possible...

243
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:39,676
...and have the fantasy
come out of characters...

244
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,512
...that are grounded
and based in a reality...

245
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,264
...or is it just gonna be...

246
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,184
...you know,
a big, fun comic-book movie?

247
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,353
I said,
"Because I'd be interested in it...

248
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,482
...if it was coming out
of real characters and truth."

249
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:55,859
And that's where
he was coming from.

250
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:59,696
And he was describing
the tone of it to me and...

251
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:05,869
Well, Sam was a big Spider-Man fan
as a kid too.

252
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,245
I don't know if you were.

253
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:11,458
I was not, but Sam apparently was
a gigantic Spider-Man fan...

254
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,502
...with the thing hanging above...

255
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:16,713
...like a poster or a painting
hanging above his bed...

256
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,965
...and he read.

257
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:22,386
But I went back and read about
the first four years of issues...

258
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:26,223
- ...which is the period that Sam read.
- Yeah.

259
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,809
You know, the early stuff.

260
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:31,728
Basically, that's sort of
what the film covers too.

261
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,439
- Yeah.
- The creation of Spider-Man...

262
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:38,068
- ...and the beginning of...
- The origin story.

263
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,738
I hear there might be a sequel.

264
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,907
- Really?
- Yes.

265
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,536
When are they
talking about making that?

266
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:49,246
Some time in the spring, I think.

267
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:52,374
I hear, like, late March
they're gonna go into production.

268
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:56,294
I guess we're hearing
the same vague rumors then, yeah.

269
00:13:56,461 --> 00:14:00,340
I think every other May, there'll be
a new Spider-Man movie for...

270
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,384
That's the idea.

271
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:05,345
For the next couple decades
or so.

272
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:09,766
I'm gonna have to, you know...

273
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:13,353
They'll have to recast me
as Uncle Ben one of these days.

274
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,732
Now, I do wanna say,
this effect, which was brilliant...

275
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:19,609
I do wanna clarify
that this is not my body...

276
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,611
...the skinny dude.

277
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,905
They had me walk...

278
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:28,285
Or they had the kid walk
and then I had to match his walk.

279
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:32,164
<i>...This recombination lab,
we use synthesized...</i>

280
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,291
And they somehow
put my head on his body.

281
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,667
It was pretty clever.

282
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:39,129
<i>...combining the genetic
information from all three spiders...</i>

283
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,590
My nose looks pretty...

284
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:44,092
- Nostrils are pretty clear.
- Always a nice shot.

285
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,845
- Yeah.
- Is that your skull there in that shot?

286
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:50,140
That's not my actual skull.

287
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,518
Something's happening.

288
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:56,730
Seems like more than a dream.

289
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:59,941
Yeah, all those effects
were just genius.

290
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,652
I guess they spent
a little time on that...

291
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,655
- ...after we got done with our jobs.
- Oh, yeah.

292
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:09,242
Now, I'm asking you for the last time.
We can't do this.

293
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:12,954
A lot of the questions that I find
that I get from people in the street...

294
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,082
...always have to do with the...

295
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,335
Not always, sometimes have to do
with the technical aspects of it.

296
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,921
And often people are asking me,
like I have a clue:

297
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:23,799
"How did they do that thing
with the...?" You know.

298
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:26,551
- I'm not sure. Right.
- I just, you know...

299
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:31,848
...say my lines and try not to waste
anybody's time too much.

300
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:35,268
It begins catalyzation when the vapor
hits the bloodstream.

301
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,522
It's amazing how long it takes
to do all that stuff too.

302
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,273
40,000 years of evolution...

303
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,194
...and we've barely tapped
the vastness of human potential.

304
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:47,906
This is a pretty interesting idea
for a villain actually...

305
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:50,617
...you know,
human performance enhancers.

306
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:54,204
Yeah. It certainly resonates...

307
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:57,207
...in a lot of different aspects
of real life.

308
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,376
Oh, that's cold.

309
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,964
A guy facing losing his company
and everything he's built...

310
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:07,300
...and all his work
that he cares personally about...

311
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:11,596
These are some of the things that I,
you know...

312
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,892
That I thought would be tricky...

313
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:19,020
...things to handle
that were handled pretty well.

314
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:22,691
Because that's where you can
really lose me in a film like this.

315
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:28,905
Being like a big action-y,
superhero film, you know.

316
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:32,367
Right, what are the themes
that it's...?

317
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,661
- What's it about besides...?
- Right.

318
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,497
It's not just like,
"Oh, a superhero, supervillain"...

319
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:42,252
...but there's personal stuff
going on for these characters.

320
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:56,057
That's one of the things you always
look for, or at least I do, that...

321
00:16:56,224 --> 00:17:00,395
Especially playing a bad guy.
You know, is he just, you know...

322
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:03,190
...a two-dimensional,
quote, unquote, bad guy or is he...

323
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,818
...a human being that could be...?
Who's coming from somewhere?

324
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,446
Yeah, nothing interesting
about the other...

325
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:12,032
And Willem, obviously,
I mean, you know...

326
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,450
He does...

327
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:16,411
You wonder if, does he
make parts really fascinating...

328
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,121
...or, you know, is he...

329
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:21,458
- Or is it written like that? Right.
- ...drawn to only the really...

330
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,959
...quirky, interesting parts?

331
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,462
- Probably a little bit of both, you know.
- Yeah.

332
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:28,131
It's always...

333
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,761
...hard for me
to go beyond the material.

334
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:35,931
I've just been fortunate,
I think and...

335
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:39,809
Selective and fortunate
to work on good things.

336
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,146
Yeah, that's really it.
It's both of those.

337
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:46,858
Yeah, and this was what
I love so much. It's like...

338
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,652
...a bunch of art-house people...

339
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:52,197
- ...making a big movie, you know?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

340
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,416
A little late for school.

341
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:06,503
I'm 27 now but...

342
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,588
This was a great touch,
with the glasses.

343
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,382
- This is great.
- I don't remember...

344
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,551
...if that's directly from the script,
or if that was...

345
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,638
I don't recall. Yeah.

346
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:20,016
But there were a lot of those
really nice little touches.

347
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:23,853
And the "Oh, by the way,
what the hell is my head on top of?"

348
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,815
- Tobey's been doing his sit-ups.
- Yeah.

349
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:32,654
That was five months of six days
a week, four hours a day...

350
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:36,700
- ...nutritionists, trainers...
- Right, for about eight seconds of...

351
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,743
- Right.
- Plus all the stunts and stuff...

352
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,829
...and looking good in the suit but...

353
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:45,250
This is the thing that I think...

354
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,544
...helps you buy it
for the rest of the movie.

355
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:49,212
Yeah, yeah.

356
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,640
I also did yoga for flexibility...

357
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,727
...and martial arts and gymnastics.

358
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,895
What martial arts?

359
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,397
- Tae Kwon do or...?
- No.

360
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:11,651
This guy, Steven Ho,
who was my martial arts trainer...

361
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,404
- That was fun, that little stunt there.
- Yeah.

362
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,531
Yeah, now that was...
There was no effect.

363
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:18,116
- No effect.
- You did the deal?

364
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:19,909
They had a little lip for me to...

365
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:23,580
The top hand,
I had a little lip to grab onto...

366
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,332
...and, yeah, just did it.

367
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,876
- It was simple but fun.
- Yeah. No, that was great.

368
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:31,921
And there were obviously a lot of
stunts and things that were done...

369
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:35,425
...digitally and all that, but I thought
that was a great little moment.

370
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:36,885
Well, we discussed it too...

371
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:40,430
...because we were talking about
maybe doing a flip or this or that...

372
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:43,475
...and I said, "You know,
let's just do something...

373
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,185
...that comes out of his energy."

374
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:48,021
The discussion wasn't just me,
but the discussion was:

375
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:52,192
"Let's do something that comes
out of his newfound energy...

376
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,361
- ...that wasn't too elaborate."
- Right.

377
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:58,031
And also if they caught him doing it,
it would be strange, but...

378
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:01,076
...not like "Oh, you did
a double flip off of the staircase."

379
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,453
- Like, "What's up?"
- Yeah, yeah.

380
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,288
Hey, M.J.

381
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:08,124
This is a part we really wanted to...
Not this scene...

382
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,043
...but this section of the movie...

383
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,798
...just build it slowly, the discovery...

384
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,467
...confusion...

385
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:20,136
...fear and then acceptance...

386
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:23,640
- ...of his newfound powers.
- Oh, of the powers, yeah.

387
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,394
Probably my favorite part
of the film.

388
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,020
Yeah, this is a great sequence.

389
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:32,649
And actually, you know,
when I first saw it, I was...

390
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:38,196
...unclear about when you slap
the side of the bus right there...

391
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:41,991
...and it comes off in your hand.
I thought, "Oh, why did that...?"

392
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,244
It wasn't until a minute later,
I went:

393
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:47,080
- "Oh, because of the spiderweb."
- Yeah.

394
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,708
The little hairs that come out
of the...

395
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:53,837
But he doesn't know
what's going on there.

396
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:59,843
He being me playing him in there.

397
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:08,017
There's a really great pace
to the movie too.

398
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,312
Putting the different elements
together...

399
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:15,191
...putting the different plots
together. You know, the way...

400
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:16,860
...Sam and the editors out...

401
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:21,948
...between your plot
and Willem's plot here...

402
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:25,827
...and ultimately, the newspaper office
and all the other fun places.

403
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:29,372
There's a great piece they put in there
with that little scary moment.

404
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,332
- The whole theater jumped.
- Yeah.

405
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:32,834
But I agree with you.

406
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:37,922
But this is all really just setup
to getting...

407
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:42,719
...to your character,
J. Jonah Jameson.

408
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:44,971
To the real central character
in the film.

409
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,432
This is just...

410
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,144
...you know, all back-story,
so they can see what is really...

411
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:54,063
That's one of the things
that was so remarkable to me...

412
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,025
...about how well done
this film is, is that...

413
00:21:57,192 --> 00:22:00,028
...there was so much exposition.

414
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:03,573
You know, really meeting
all these characters for the first time...

415
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,202
...and really taking time
to get to know them.

416
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:10,747
- Oh, this was very cool too.
- Yeah, I love this stunt. It was fun.

417
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:13,875
I heard that took you three takes
to get all those things right.

418
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:15,084
You know what?

419
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:20,006
They were gonna do that digitally
and...

420
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,217
Someone came up with the idea...

421
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:25,261
...of standing above the camera
and dropping all that stuff...

422
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:27,430
...and hoping it landed right.

423
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:29,849
And I think we saved them
a bunch of money.

424
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,601
- Are you kidding me?
- Swear to God.

425
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:35,104
- I had no idea.
- We gave it a shot, you know.

426
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,524
I held the tray
and he dropped stuff...

427
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,027
...and I had to move the tray around
and it just landed so we could...

428
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:43,446
I had assumed that
that was done digitally.

429
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:45,156
No.

430
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:47,700
It was not.

431
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:55,041
Because I'm a Method actor,
I actually have webbing in my wrist.

432
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,460
- You had that surgically implanted?
- Yes.

433
00:22:57,627 --> 00:23:00,088
- You're intense, man.
- Yeah, very.

434
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:05,134
No, they had his...
Well, that's real but some of the...

435
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:17,397
This was a very funny sequence.
And then the...

436
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:20,233
- Yeah, the tray trailing behind you.
- Yeah.

437
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,903
Parker?

438
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:31,744
- A little prop acting there.
- Yeah.

439
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,538
It worked.

440
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:42,380
This was a sequence that...

441
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:45,341
...I had no idea
what it was gonna end up like...

442
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,510
...but the idea of it...

443
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:49,387
- ...sounded cool.
- Yeah.

444
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:53,141
The first time we really see
the Spidey-sense.

445
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,104
- It's a fight!
- Think you're pretty funny, freak?

446
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:01,316
There was so many
of those specialty shots and...

447
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:04,193
- Come on, Flash, stop.
- I don't wanna fight you, Flash.

448
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,821
- I wouldn't wanna fight me neither.
- Kick his ass.

449
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,092
Help him, Harry.

450
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:34,557
How'd he do that?

451
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:37,894
So did you work on that stuff,
that triple backward flip there?

452
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:41,939
I actually did and I...

453
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,901
I can't say that I did it as well
as the stuntman...

454
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:47,028
...or anything like that...

455
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:51,199
...but I was working
with my gymnastics coach...

456
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:54,661
...and getting in the harness
and doing double backflips.

457
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:59,040
I never did a triple,
but I did some double backflips.

458
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,418
And I could pull them.

459
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:05,546
Sometimes the landings
weren't really smooth.

460
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,757
- You didn't stick the landing?
- Yeah.

461
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:34,784
One thing that worked well
about the movie...

462
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:37,203
...but about this sequence is...

463
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:40,707
...real Spider-Man fans who had...

464
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:45,628
...all the knowledge about
the intricate details of this...

465
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:48,715
...really appreciated
the attention to detail.

466
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,717
And people who didn't know
Spider-Man...

467
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,802
...who were just going
to see a movie...

468
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:54,929
...didn't feel they were
out of the loop.

469
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:58,808
- Yup.
- Because it all developed so well.

470
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:02,019
- Yeah. This is fun.
- This is great.

471
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,564
Yeah, I went to this...

472
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:07,734
...convention, a sci-fi convention...

473
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,695
...and people were so excited
when we showed them...

474
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:13,322
...the scene in the cafeteria.

475
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,074
And they couldn't be more jazzed.

476
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:19,537
And, you know, like you said,
we were making the film for...

477
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:22,123
...people who really knew
the comic book...

478
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,667
...as well as people
who had no idea.

479
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:26,586
Right.

480
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:32,675
This was fun. I was actually...

481
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:35,762
Well, there I was on the roof...

482
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,681
...and they had me on a wire
jumping down.

483
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:41,350
But the other stuff,
jumping from buildings...

484
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,186
...I was in a parking lot...

485
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:46,105
...with this huge green screen
behind me...

486
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:49,150
...and a rig above me
that had wires hooked up.

487
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:51,778
And I was running
and they would yank me up about...

488
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:52,987
Go, web!

489
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:54,655
This was Sam's idea.

490
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:58,201
Just completely his idea.
And I was like, "Sam, are you sure?

491
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:03,206
You know, if it's not good,
please don't leave it in the movie.

492
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:06,042
Because I'm really putting myself
out there."

493
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:09,045
Everybody that works with Sam
has a few of those moments.

494
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:11,005
- Right.
- "You really want me to...?

495
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:12,632
Well, okay."

496
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,884
I just went for it and...

497
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:18,012
Yeah, it's great. This is one
of the big laughs in the movie.

498
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:19,722
Yeah, it was fun.

499
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:24,352
It was good. And that's why
I like working with people...

500
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:27,188
...who I feel like I trust.
You know, I like their films.

501
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:29,315
I appreciate them as a filmmaker.

502
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:32,151
So then it gives me more freedom
to try things.

503
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:35,905
It's so important not to have that voice
in the back of your head warning you:

504
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:38,282
- Right.
- "You can't really trust this guy.

505
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:40,910
- You're gonna look like an idiot."
- Yeah.

506
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,996
So I've been very fortunate
during my whole career.

507
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,289
And with Sam it's great.

508
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:47,917
And I'm very excited
that he's doing the next one.

509
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:49,252
Yeah.

510
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,758
- I'll say that hurt.
- Yeah?

511
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:57,468
That hurt.

512
00:27:57,635 --> 00:28:01,097
Some things actually hurt
on this movie.

513
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:09,605
And I will say that the stuntmen
who were doubling me...

514
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:15,027
...some of the real Spider-men...

515
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:19,574
...probably had a few... Or did have a
few more bumps and bruises than I did.

516
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,367
- Yeah.
- But I got my share too.

517
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,870
And they did a great job...

518
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:27,081
...and not only
did the more risky things...

519
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:31,294
...but also helped me choreograph
some of the moves when I was doing it.

520
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,422
Yeah. That's another
part of what's collaborative about it.

521
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:37,091
It's not like,
"Tobey's gonna go sit in his trailer...

522
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:38,801
...while the stuntman comes in."

523
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:41,304
- Right.
- You guys worked together...

524
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:45,141
...on making that transition smooth.

525
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:48,853
- Why don't you do them?
- Get in here and do the dishes.

526
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,317
Was this in Queens? This location?

527
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:58,362
I think so.

528
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:01,198
It was somewhere in New York.
They put you in a vehicle...

529
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,950
...and took you there and...

530
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:04,702
- Yeah.
- It was across a bridge.

531
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:05,912
Yeah.

532
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:09,081
I know there was a Laundromat
down the street.

533
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:12,001
Did you get a little laundry done
between shots?

534
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:14,545
No, but I sat in there,
watched a basketball game.

535
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:16,839
- Yeah?
- I did, yeah.

536
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:19,550
I, of course, live in New York,
and all of my scenes...

537
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:22,345
...which were to take place
in New York were shot in L.A.

538
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:24,972
In Los Angeles. Of course.

539
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:27,183
Yeah. Do you like Los Angeles?

540
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:30,186
I do not like Los Angeles.

541
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:33,189
You do not like Los Angeles.

542
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:34,357
I love New York.

543
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,735
My wife and I discuss moving out
to the West Coast once in a while...

544
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:39,820
- ...because her family is out here.
- Yeah.

545
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:43,199
And I've steadfastly resisted
thus far...

546
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:45,284
...but we'll see. You know.

547
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:48,329
- You have to spend time in both.
- Yeah, you do.

548
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:51,582
Not to get too specific,
but you live in Manhattan?

549
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:53,501
Lived in Manhattan for a long time...

550
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:56,754
...and then when our family grew,
we moved out to the burbs.

551
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:59,298
I see. Very good.

552
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:03,344
I love visiting New York.

553
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,931
I wanna...

554
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:09,392
...act...

555
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,061
...on-stage.

556
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,230
This is really the scene where...

557
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:19,735
I think Kirsten's character
is really a good character...

558
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:21,612
...and she has a really good arc.

559
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:25,574
And that she's a little bit of a typical...
I don't wanna say "typical."

560
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,618
She's got the thing I can relate to...

561
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:31,288
...which is being in school
and really wanting to be popular.

562
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:34,750
- Wanting to belong to the cool group.
- Right.

563
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:38,337
And she gets involved with people
maybe for the wrong reasons.

564
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:43,259
And she hasn't thus far,
in her home life or in school...

565
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:46,429
...felt like anybody
has appreciated her...

566
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:47,763
...or understood her...

567
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,599
...or she's felt like she could
open up or trust anyone.

568
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,560
And Peter...

569
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:59,108
...you know, is a pretty open kid.

570
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:02,278
And really
has been infatuated with her...

571
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:03,863
...since he was 6 years old...

572
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:07,033
...so to have the opportunity
to be one-on-one like this...

573
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:10,453
. and look at her and say,
"I'm here to listen and understand...

574
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,163
...and care.

575
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:13,873
And whatever your troubles are...

576
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,250
...you can share them with me
and trust me."

577
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:19,628
And he's very supportive
and encouraging.

578
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:24,175
It's so great also in a quote-unquote
action movie, a superhero movie...

579
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:27,428
...to actually have
extended scenes like this...

580
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:31,182
...that are really about the interaction
between these two kids...

581
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:35,811
...and not just there to set up
the next car chase or whatever.

582
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:37,521
In so many movies today...

583
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:41,108
...it's like your longest scene...

584
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:44,945
...is 30 seconds or something,
you know.

585
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:47,114
You're doing
a one-and-a-half page scene...

586
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:49,658
...and it's your big scene, you know.

587
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:53,329
I actually have to memorize
a couple of lines for...

588
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,003
Yeah, this and the scene later
in the hospital.

589
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:04,256
A lot of nice little scenes
with you and Kirsten.

590
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,509
And the rain of course.

591
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,010
Yeah.

592
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:23,192
And this was derived...

593
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:26,570
...from the actual comic books.

594
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:30,991
- Him doing the wrestling match.
- Right.

595
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:36,205
Of course, this is you
doing all the artwork?

596
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:39,416
The drawing. Oh, yes, of course.

597
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:43,546
No. And to be honest with you,
I'm not even sure who...

598
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,089
- That same hand guy.
- Right.

599
00:32:45,256 --> 00:32:47,007
- The same guy that got bit.
- Same guy.

600
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:48,717
You know...

601
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:04,567
This is a real credit to Sam
and the editors I think.

602
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:09,530
Because this is obviously
something they put together that...

603
00:33:09,697 --> 00:33:12,074
- ...goes into his mind and...
- Right.

604
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:13,909
...you know, becomes whimsical...

605
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:17,246
...but it's supported with what's
going on with the character.

606
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:20,249
That's the kind of thing,
when you're shooting it...

607
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:23,836
...it's one of those tedious days
where, "Now we're gonna do a shot...

608
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:27,923
- ...of you looking at your notebook."
- Right. Exactly.

609
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:31,760
And it all gets put together
and it's all worth it.

610
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,599
And Rosemary Harris,
who is so wonderful.

611
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,809
Oh, I love her.

612
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:40,352
She's great.

613
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,480
I've actually done a couple movies
that she was in...

614
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:46,901
...with Sam directing,
and never worked with her, you know.

615
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:50,446
- Never had a scene with her.
- Yeah, she was in The <i>Gift.</i>

616
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:52,448
Something else or it was just The <i>Gift?</i>

617
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:56,035
That's the only other time
that I've been in a film with her.

618
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:58,871
And here's an example of...

619
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:01,290
...another character
who's really progressed...

620
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:03,751
...in terms of the superhero
and supervillain...

621
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:06,086
...at a similar rate.

622
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:09,965
- Yeah, right.
- Which is what you were talking about.

623
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:16,472
Something's bothering him. Maybe
he's too embarrassed to tell me.

624
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,308
Maybe I'm too embarrassed
to ask him.

625
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,144
I just don't know anymore.

626
00:34:23,187 --> 00:34:27,191
Cliff was very much into the part...

627
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:32,321
...and it's a very important part
as Uncle Ben for Peter Parker.

628
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:34,990
And...

629
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:38,953
He just worked really hard
and would come up with...

630
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,081
He would write stuff
to either support scenes...

631
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:45,960
...or as alternative dialogue...

632
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:49,171
...and it was great.
He's a really poetic guy.

633
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:54,260
And he's a father himself,
so he was...

634
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,303
Because we haven't talked
for so long...

635
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:58,472
He seems like he would be
a cool dad.

636
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:01,517
You shirk your chores.
You have all those...

637
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:05,437
Yeah, this is such a pivotal scene
in the movie.

638
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:09,358
If you don't love this guy
and appreciate what he's saying...

639
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:12,361
...and buy into this whole thing,
then...

640
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:14,863
I mean, this becomes
Peter's motivation, really...

641
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,199
...for who Spider-Man is.

642
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:19,410
Yeah, and like you say, it's also...

643
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:21,328
I mean if you're a Spider-Man fan...

644
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:24,039
Oh, sorry. That was
one of the great jokes too.

645
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:26,875
"I know, I know. I know the changes
you're going through."

646
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,877
Yeah, yeah, kind of.

647
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:33,590
He says, "I went through exactly..."
No, not exactly.

648
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:36,010
- A little different.
- Right.

649
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:40,848
But if you're a Spider-Man fan,
then you see all this stuff coming.

650
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:43,809
You know what the guy's
gotta say in this scene.

651
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:47,688
But I think that's what's so great,
is it really felt like...

652
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:50,941
...organic and natural and...

653
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:54,028
Are you afraid I'll become a criminal?

654
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,322
And I'm gonna go ahead and say...

655
00:35:56,488 --> 00:36:01,243
...that was also
Sam's great choice in casting...

656
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:06,665
...in particular the guy who plays
Peter Parker-slash-Spider-Man.

657
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:08,500
Indeed.

658
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,919
- Just kidding.
- That's one of the things...

659
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,881
...that Sam does so well, you know.

660
00:36:14,048 --> 00:36:16,216
Get the right people
for the right parts.

661
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:26,935
Little red sweatshirt coming out
of the back of the jeans.

662
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:30,564
Little subtle touch
that probably most people...

663
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:31,982
...didn't see there.

664
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:34,777
Yeah, I'd be among
those most people that missed that.

665
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,196
Including you, yeah.

666
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:50,751
This was the first...

667
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:55,547
...big sequence we shot. We shot
some stuff in my bedroom first.

668
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:58,050
And then came...

669
00:36:58,217 --> 00:37:00,469
The shirt-off scene
was the first day of work.

670
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:01,720
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

671
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:03,555
But then this was like...

672
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,599
...the next couple weeks
or something.

673
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:07,726
Or next 10 days.
And we had a huge crowd...

674
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:11,146
...and it was fun working with...

675
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,608
..."Macho Man" Randy Savage.

676
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:16,443
Because he knows
how to work crowds.

677
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:19,696
And these are extras
who signed up and were excited...

678
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:23,033
...but after four or five days
of sitting around...

679
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,829
...with their brown paper-bag lunches,
it's like...

680
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,998
- The novelty kind of wears off.
- Yeah, the novelty wears off.

681
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:32,668
And he would perform for them...

682
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:34,795
...and he would get me in
on the action.

683
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:38,257
He would whisper things to me,
"Okay, now do this and do that."

684
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:41,051
- And I would, you know...
- You would do it, of course...

685
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:43,345
- ...because you're not stupid.
- Right.

686
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:46,974
And the guy's arm
is bigger than my chest.

687
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:49,726
No, no. Sign me up.

688
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:52,020
- This is a funny character here too.
- Yeah.

689
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:55,357
...Understand the NYWL is not
responsible for any injury you may and...

690
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:57,818
"Probably Will." Yeah.

691
00:37:57,985 --> 00:38:00,237
And you're participating
under your own free will?

692
00:38:00,446 --> 00:38:01,530
Yes.

693
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:05,492
Down the hall to the ramp.
May God be with you. Next.

694
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:10,330
Told you! Told you!

695
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:12,332
Winner!

696
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:13,750
Next victim!

697
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:21,216
Yeah, I think this is the first part
of the movie where...

698
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:23,218
...I'm covering
my 4-year-old's eyes...

699
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:25,304
- ...when we were watching it.
- Oh, yeah.

700
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,307
I'm surprised sometimes
that people are like:

701
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:30,893
"Oh, yeah, my 3-year-old
loved the movie."

702
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:34,438
- I'm like, "Really? Okay."
- Yeah.

703
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:37,733
One of the nice things
about the flavor of the movie...

704
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,570
Certainly that last sequence with
you and Willem gets pretty intense...

705
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:44,698
...but it's not too scary...

706
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:48,952
...for a 9-, or 10-, or 11-
or 12-year-old.

707
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,664
No, my little guy has actually
only seen a few selected scenes.

708
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,959
- Portions of it.
- But I gotta tell you, in all honesty...

709
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:57,878
- ...he's a huge Spider-Man fan.
- Yeah?

710
00:38:58,045 --> 00:39:00,797
He's jumping off the bunk bed
just like Spider-Man!

711
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:02,925
- He was Spider-Man for Halloween.
- Oh, yes.

712
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:04,927
Completely uncoerced, I promise.

713
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:07,429
This is Sam Raimi here
I'm talking to.

714
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:09,765
- That's his hand. That's Sam.
- Okay, all right.

715
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:12,100
That's his Alfred Hitchcock
appearance.

716
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,310
- Exactly.
- Excellent.

717
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:14,770
I did not know that either.

718
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:17,397
We were all encouraging him,
"You have to do it."

719
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:20,567
He was throwing stuff at me.
He loves to get involved like that.

720
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:23,195
He was one of the people
throwing popcorn.

721
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:26,782
And later he throws rocks at me
and all kinds of stuff.

722
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:28,742
Fake rocks, but...

723
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:31,954
And he would tell people, "Really,
no, throw it right in his face."

724
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,122
And I love that Bruce Campbell...

725
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:35,624
...who is...

726
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:39,086
Who Sam has worked with
numerous times...

727
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:41,922
...is the guy
who introduces Spider-Man...

728
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:43,632
...and gives Spider-Man his name.

729
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:47,636
A little good piece of history
for them, you know?

730
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,807
Bruce told me,
he was one of the first to warn me:

731
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:55,018
"Listen, Sam likes to get involved.

732
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:57,437
He likes to throw things at you."
He was, like...

733
00:39:57,604 --> 00:40:00,899
He kept prodding him with a stick
in one of the <i>Evil</i> Dead movies.

734
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,901
- There's Bruce right there.
- Yeah.

735
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:08,490
This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!

736
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:14,246
He doesn't really know what the extent
of his powers are right now, you know?

737
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:17,749
He just wants the girl. He wants
to make the three grand to buy the car.

738
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,711
Basically everybody's motivation
at that age, pretty much.

739
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,754
- At that age?
- Yeah, okay, sorry.

740
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,591
- Does it change?
- I forget, you're still a young pup.

741
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,593
I'm 27. Does it change?

742
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,177
You tell me because I know...

743
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:32,389
- ...you're a couple years older.
- No, it doesn't change.

744
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:34,933
- When the kids come along...
- Right.

745
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:38,645
...it's slightly different. But I'm 47
and I still try and impress...

746
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:41,023
- ...my wife once in a while.
- There you go.

747
00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:44,693
How long did
this whole sequence take?

748
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:49,865
I don't recall exactly.
I feel like it was like a week or so.

749
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:57,039
And this was a chair
made of a different material...

750
00:40:57,205 --> 00:41:01,209
...but was like an aluminum.
So it was still a metal.

751
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,045
- They would...
- And he was still...

752
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,255
- ...wailing on you.
- He would bang you...

753
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:08,216
...but it didn't really...
He would just kind of pop it.

754
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:11,011
- Like he hits and then pulls back.
- Yeah.

755
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:14,473
But I always like
a little contact because...

756
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,808
...it gives me something to react to.

757
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:21,063
Oh, yeah, there's nothing worse
than a stunt fight where there's...

758
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,731
You're really having to fake it.

759
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:24,900
There's one thing worse,
getting hurt badly.

760
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:26,526
-Right.

761
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:30,447
And those bars had some kind of
metal inside of them...

762
00:41:30,614 --> 00:41:34,242
...and were just padded.
But I think, you know...

763
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:38,580
I think he was feeling
a little bruised up after that stuff.

764
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:41,917
See, that's such a great shot there.

765
00:41:42,084 --> 00:41:45,921
And Sam stays on your eyes maybe
twice as long as a lot of guys would.

766
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:49,424
- Yeah.
- But it's all worth it.

767
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:51,259
Now get out of here.

768
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:55,722
A hundred bucks'?
The ad said 3000.

769
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:58,308
Well, check it again, webhead.

770
00:41:58,475 --> 00:42:02,354
It said three grand for three minutes.
You pinned him in two.

771
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:05,941
For that, I give you 100.
You're lucky to get that.

772
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:07,484
I need that money.

773
00:42:07,943 --> 00:42:11,029
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

774
00:42:19,121 --> 00:42:22,457
- Hey, what the hell...?
- Put the money in the bag.

775
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,627
Hurry UP!

776
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:34,052
Hey! He stole the gate!

777
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,179
Stop that guy!

778
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:39,015
Stop him! He's got my money!

779
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,475
Thanks.

780
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:44,146
What's the hell's the matter with you?
You let him go!

781
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,523
Cut him off in the lobby
and call the cops!

782
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:50,736
You could've taken that guy apart.
Now he'll get away with my money.

783
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,155
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

784
00:42:55,282 --> 00:42:57,743
A little vindictive there.

785
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,912
Pleased with himself.

786
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:10,213
Now, that's where people who
don't know the plot of Spider-Man...

787
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,048
...are thinking:

788
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:15,594
"Yeah, okay, that was kind of glib
and kind of clever.

789
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:18,889
But I'm not sure if I'm liking
what this guy's doing right there."

790
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:21,391
Yeah. Well, that's
what I like about it too.

791
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:25,687
It's, again, different layers
to a character.

792
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:27,022
He's not just...

793
00:43:27,189 --> 00:43:30,066
You know, he's a normal person
who makes mistakes.

794
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:33,528
Right. Yeah, yeah.
He makes bad choices and is not...

795
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,822
This is just...

796
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:38,366
- What happened?
- Carjacker. He's been shot.

797
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:41,995
We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.

798
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:43,580
Uncle Ben?

799
00:43:44,498 --> 00:43:45,999
Uncle Ben.

800
00:43:49,753 --> 00:43:51,087
Uncle Ben?

801
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:56,218
Peter.

802
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58,887
I'm here, Uncle Ben.

803
00:44:04,518 --> 00:44:05,727
Peter.

804
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:30,752
They got the shooter.
He's headed south on Fifth Avenue.

805
00:44:30,961 --> 00:44:35,674
We got three cars in pursuit.
All right, folks. Come on, move back.

806
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:44,015
- That's a great transition.
- Yeah.

807
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:15,755
- No.
- Yeah, how was that...

808
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,425
...wall-climbing effect done?

809
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:22,429
That would be John Dykstra
and his team of magicians...

810
00:45:22,596 --> 00:45:24,431
...animating...

811
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:26,641
Animating that sequence.

812
00:45:27,434 --> 00:45:30,061
Which I'm not sure
why it was animated exactly.

813
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,689
I feel like it could have...

814
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:37,652
But some of this stuff is
pretty amazing that they did. It's...

815
00:45:38,111 --> 00:45:41,448
This was green screen,
they shot me.

816
00:45:41,615 --> 00:45:47,662
And then they probably shot some
kind of plate shot for this.

817
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:49,748
I don't even remember
how we did all this.

818
00:45:49,915 --> 00:45:52,042
You're going between
live-action and animation.

819
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:54,419
- Yeah. Exactly.
- And it's really... You know...

820
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:59,674
...I've never been a huge fan
of the computer animation...

821
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:02,469
...but it really... It's getting...

822
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:05,096
- It's getting pretty good now.
- Yeah.

823
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:08,683
Really, it's pretty seamless
in this movie.

824
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:13,021
It's certainly the best
that I've seen in any of...

825
00:46:13,188 --> 00:46:15,398
...the movies I've seen
with computer animation.

826
00:46:15,565 --> 00:46:18,193
It's pretty great. You're
dealing with the progression...

827
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,695
- ...of how good Peter is here.
- Right.

828
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:24,783
Because, you know,
he's a little awkward and his...

829
00:46:26,076 --> 00:46:31,623
The way his body moves around.
And he slowly gets the hang of it.

830
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:38,129
And part of this,
I was actually on a car.

831
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:42,050
And Michael Papa john was actually
shooting live rounds at you or...?

832
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:46,054
They weren't live rounds, no.
They were...

833
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,848
I'm not sure exactly.

834
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:54,854
That would be animated.

835
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:56,898
You didn't do that jump?

836
00:46:57,065 --> 00:46:58,775
No.

837
00:46:59,776 --> 00:47:02,904
But then I was there
on the car moving.

838
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:11,579
That stuff was a lot of fun for me.

839
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:16,376
Very different stuff for me,
different than anything I'd ever done.

840
00:47:16,543 --> 00:47:19,921
And it was fun to do that.

841
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:24,426
I think that's one of the things that
almost every actor I've worked with...

842
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:28,596
You know, there's... Again we
hearken back to that 9-year-old boy...

843
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:31,850
...part of you. Just to be running
around, jumping on stuff.

844
00:47:32,017 --> 00:47:35,562
And doing action sequences
and fights.

845
00:47:35,729 --> 00:47:40,233
You know, that's part of the fantasy
about being in the movies...

846
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,902
- ...that you had when you were a kid.
- Exactly.

847
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:46,489
To be, like, stimulated creatively
as an adult...

848
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:49,451
...and get to play as a child
in the playground, like:

849
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:52,787
"Oh, I get to be
in a superhero movie, you know?

850
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:54,414
Oh, that's cool."

851
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:58,084
You know, and do,
like, action sequences.

852
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:02,964
Don't hurt me. Give me a chance.
Give me a chance!

853
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:07,635
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?

854
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:12,724
And here he realizes that
he is responsible or feels responsible...

855
00:48:12,891 --> 00:48:16,269
- ...for his uncle's death.
- Right.

856
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:20,315
His actions have come back
to haunt him.

857
00:48:31,076 --> 00:48:32,160
See you.

858
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:57,310
<i>Freeze! We've got the place
completely surrounded.</i>

859
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:25,839
They actually built the falcon thing
I'm sitting on in a studio...

860
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:29,050
...and the rest was a plate shot.

861
00:49:29,217 --> 00:49:31,219
Like green screen.

862
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:42,397
Oh, no. My God.

863
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:48,278
This is a scene where
you don't get in on Rosemary...

864
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:51,322
...but I came in and she just like...

865
00:49:52,115 --> 00:49:55,827
You know? She blew me away. I came
in, I didn't even have to do anything.

866
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:59,622
Just look at her and just, you know,
I was falling to pieces watching her.

867
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:05,628
And that's one of those scenes,
it's so effective and... In a way...

868
00:50:05,795 --> 00:50:09,632
...when I'm doing a scene like that,
I'm like, "Yeah, but let's see our faces.

869
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:12,927
Let's see the emotion that we're..."
But, you know, we've seen that.

870
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:16,389
We saw that in Uncle Ben's
death scene with you...

871
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:20,101
...and it's so interesting
to have that...

872
00:50:20,268 --> 00:50:22,312
- ...further-away perspective...
- Yeah.

873
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:24,647
...on that gut-wrenching
emotional moment.

874
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:27,150
It is interesting that she's...
Despite the fact...

875
00:50:27,317 --> 00:50:29,402
...the camera's on her back
the whole time...

876
00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:31,779
- ...and it's, you know, 30 feet away...
- Yeah.

877
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:34,490
...she knows... Well, obviously,
she's a great actress.

878
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:37,202
She's working just as hard
as if it were a close-up.

879
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:39,787
- Absolutely.
- That's what makes that scene work.

880
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:42,624
If you two just hit your marks,
went where you were told...

881
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:47,879
...because it's a long shot,
then it wouldn't be effective.

882
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:51,299
- That was another great little transition.
- Yeah.

883
00:50:52,634 --> 00:50:58,473
"Chess." That's what we said there.
"Chess." Oh, man.

884
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:03,728
It's not quite the same
without Uncle Ben.

885
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:08,608
I think it's about a month later...

886
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:11,486
...after his death.

887
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:16,824
And this triangle is interesting...

888
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:20,453
...because you have
James and his father...

889
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:24,165
...and, you know...

890
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:31,172
James, who's Harry Osborn, isn't
quite what Norman wants in a son.

891
00:51:31,339 --> 00:51:35,218
- Right.
- And my character, Peter, is more...

892
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:39,347
You know, a science whiz
who really appreciates his work...

893
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:48,022
...and is driven and wants to do
things for himself.

894
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:53,319
It creates some jealousy for Harry.

895
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:58,491
But I really crave that father figure
and that mentor.

896
00:51:58,658 --> 00:52:02,036
To get close to somebody like that
who has the kind of accomplishments...

897
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:05,039
...he has in science
is amazing for Peter's character.

898
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:06,666
Right.

899
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:10,795
And this is after.

900
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:18,136
It's an empty house
without Uncle Ben.

901
00:52:56,758 --> 00:52:58,968
I missed him a lot today.

902
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:03,056
I know.

903
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:06,976
Acting's funny,
because this is one of those scenes...

904
00:53:07,143 --> 00:53:11,189
...that's kind of a tough scene,
for me anyways.

905
00:53:11,898 --> 00:53:14,317
And we did it a few times...

906
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:20,573
...and, you know, just one time
I got hooked into it and it felt right.

907
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:23,284
- And the other times didn't. You know?
- Yeah.

908
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:27,747
They say, you know, it's like
lightening in a bottle or something.

909
00:53:27,914 --> 00:53:31,459
You're just there to... Turn the camera
on, you hope to catch the moments.

910
00:53:31,626 --> 00:53:32,668
Right.

911
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:37,465
And a lot of the other time... A lot of
the other takes here, I felt like I was...

912
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:44,722
You know, I wasn't connected to it,
or I was pushing or it felt okay.

913
00:53:47,934 --> 00:53:50,019
This one... And I don't know how it...

914
00:53:50,186 --> 00:53:52,522
I'm not talking about
how it comes off to people...

915
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:56,901
...but for me, it felt honest.

916
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,320
Well, and that's a...

917
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:03,449
Right there is one of the differences
between working on stage...

918
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:07,078
...and working in the movies,
you know, because you do get...

919
00:54:07,245 --> 00:54:08,704
You get the opportunity to...

920
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:11,165
- Do it more than once.
- ...have a few sort of:

921
00:54:11,332 --> 00:54:14,502
"Well, that one was okay.
Let's try it again." And...

922
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:19,006
It's also always good
to have the other actor in the scene...

923
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:24,053
...you know, really working with you
and connecting with you...

924
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,514
- ...and helping to bring that out.
- I need that.

925
00:54:26,681 --> 00:54:30,268
I mean, I... I'm not... I'm not good...

926
00:54:30,435 --> 00:54:32,854
I mean, I won't say "not good"...

927
00:54:34,689 --> 00:54:38,359
...but for me, I feed so much
off of the other actor, you know?

928
00:54:38,526 --> 00:54:39,986
Yeah.

929
00:54:41,154 --> 00:54:43,531
And just the sort of,
the crying thing itself.

930
00:54:43,698 --> 00:54:46,409
I mean, there are a lot of tricks
that you can use...

931
00:54:46,576 --> 00:54:48,578
...to have water
coming out of your eyes...

932
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:52,498
- ...but if it's not connected...
- Right.

933
00:54:52,665 --> 00:54:55,877
...and coming from
somewhere inside...

934
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:59,672
...at least I think... You know, I think
you can always tell the difference.

935
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,926
Yeah. Well, actually,
I don't wanna get into that...

936
00:55:04,093 --> 00:55:07,763
...but there's
Sean Peon's performance...

937
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:10,975
<i>...in Dead Man Walking.</i>

938
00:55:11,142 --> 00:55:14,061
There's a whole sequence
where he's not really shedding tears...

939
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:18,566
...but he's, like, shaking,
almost like convulsing with emotion.

940
00:55:18,733 --> 00:55:20,651
There's no tears
coming out of his eyes...

941
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:23,321
...but he's... I mean,
I'm so there with his character.

942
00:55:23,488 --> 00:55:26,449
He's working so hard to not
have the tears come out of his eyes.

943
00:55:26,616 --> 00:55:28,326
- Unbelievable.
- Yeah, yeah.

944
00:55:28,493 --> 00:55:31,412
- Yeah, he can act a little bit.
- Yeah, he's all right.

945
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:34,749
So all this stuff when, you know,
Spider-Man's doing his thing...

946
00:55:34,916 --> 00:55:39,879
Now, that's Lucy. That was just
Lucy Lawless who plays Xena...

947
00:55:40,046 --> 00:55:42,632
...which Sam is involved
in the TV show.

948
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:46,052
So she made a little cameo
that probably most people...

949
00:55:46,219 --> 00:55:48,346
Did not know that either.
Quite the makeup job.

950
00:55:48,513 --> 00:55:50,348
Yeah, exactly.

951
00:55:50,515 --> 00:55:56,354
Those were the Twin Towers reflected
in his eye there for a second.

952
00:55:58,231 --> 00:56:01,943
- Now the movie gets going here.
- Thank God!

953
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:04,862
Like a breath of fresh air.

954
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:09,075
Really uptight fresh air.

955
00:56:10,618 --> 00:56:13,287
Great head of hair
on the guy though.

956
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:18,417
This is what's fun too
about being an actor. It's like...

957
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:22,630
...of course, I know it's you, but
you're disappearing into a character.

958
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:25,424
It's a really definitive character...

959
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:29,595
...both in his look and in his attitude,
you know?

960
00:56:29,762 --> 00:56:34,100
It's like, people... I would tell people,
"Oh, yeah. That's J.K. Simmons.

961
00:56:34,267 --> 00:56:36,811
He was in this and that."
"Really? That's the same guy?

962
00:56:36,978 --> 00:56:39,772
Get out of here." You know.

963
00:56:39,981 --> 00:56:41,232
Every copy.

964
00:56:41,774 --> 00:56:47,655
That's the fun part of being the
semi-anonymous character actor...

965
00:56:47,822 --> 00:56:52,451
...to be different all the time.
And that, of course, is...

966
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:54,495
- ...Ted Raimi...
- Right.

967
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:58,124
...being abused by his boss,
as he is abused by his older brother...

968
00:56:58,291 --> 00:57:00,042
...the director.

969
00:57:01,002 --> 00:57:02,044
Very much so.

970
00:57:02,211 --> 00:57:05,423
Put an ad on the front page:
"Cash for a picture of Spider-Man."

971
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:09,218
He doesn't wanna be famous?
I'll make him infamous!

972
00:57:11,804 --> 00:57:16,684
There's the Moondance Diner.

973
00:57:16,851 --> 00:57:19,395
A landmark downtown.

974
00:57:21,397 --> 00:57:25,985
Peter Parker is seeing Mary Jane
for the first time since graduation.

975
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:31,866
- What are you doing around here?
- Begging for a job. How about you?

976
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:35,202
These are of course,
all extras that you see...

977
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:38,789
...despite how crowded
New York can be.

978
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:44,211
At least in the local area there.

979
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:46,213
Right. So you have...

980
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:50,343
...hundreds of people
working crowd control et cetera...

981
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:52,553
...in New York's finest
and everybody else...

982
00:57:53,054 --> 00:57:56,057
...cordoning off the area,
keeping...

983
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,726
...the fans and the curious onlookers...

984
00:57:58,893 --> 00:58:02,063
<i>wand the photographers,
at cetera, away.</i>

985
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:04,523
Yeah. With people it's kind of fun...

986
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:08,527
...you know, because they're excited
about what we're doing...

987
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:11,572
...and so I kind of like that.

988
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:17,161
It took me a little getting used to
having several photographers...

989
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:21,582
...in your eyeline as you're shooting
something, just clicking away.

990
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:24,293
- That's nice.
- It was disconcerting at first...

991
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:26,420
...but then I got used to it.

992
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:29,256
And they try to strike deals
with you too, you know:

993
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:32,093
"Give me a couple good shots
and I'll leave you alone."

994
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:34,387
- Yeah? Great.
- Yeah.

995
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:39,016
Yeah, and then once you do that
for one guy, then you...

996
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:41,644
Then they're calling all their buddies.

997
00:58:41,811 --> 00:58:44,730
Getting on the paparazzi hotline.

998
00:58:44,897 --> 00:58:46,649
But...

999
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:54,281
There's Peter being, in her eyes,
supportive and understanding...

1000
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:56,450
...unlike other people in her life.

1001
00:58:56,617 --> 00:58:58,494
Let's get some lunch some evening.

1002
00:58:58,786 --> 00:59:00,538
And him...

1003
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:06,836
...still being affected
and infatuated by her...

1004
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:10,005
...but just finding out
that he's been deceived...

1005
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:14,051
...by his roommate-slash-best friend,
Harry Osborn.

1006
00:59:24,437 --> 00:59:26,897
Timing's perfect. Hey.

1007
00:59:27,106 --> 00:59:30,401
Five new contracts. It'll be great.

1008
00:59:32,528 --> 00:59:35,197
Storming Norman's
making his weekly inspection.

1009
00:59:35,448 --> 00:59:38,492
Better than the average
two broke, out-of-work guys'...

1010
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:40,745
- Apartment?
- ...Manhattan apartment. Yeah.

1011
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:43,581
Well, there was actually
big discussions about that...

1012
00:59:43,748 --> 00:59:48,669
...and how to do it,
and it was basically decided that...

1013
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:50,796
...Norman probably owned
the building.

1014
00:59:50,963 --> 00:59:54,216
- Right.
- And gave the apartment...

1015
00:59:54,592 --> 00:59:59,346
...to his son.
And I kept talking to them about...

1016
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:04,685
You know, and they agreed that it
should be somewhat modest in size...

1017
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:07,897
...inside, despite its size.
Because it's obviously...

1018
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,816
- ...a pretty nice place for Manhattan.
- Yeah.

1019
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:13,944
I don't think
I could afford that apartment.

1020
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,572
- Well, not before Spider-Man.
- Right.

1021
01:00:16,739 --> 01:00:19,450
- Maybe after the sequel.
- Yeah, yeah.

1022
01:00:19,909 --> 01:00:23,162
Pete, you're probably looking
for a job now, right?

1023
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,207
Dad, maybe you can help him out.

1024
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:30,711
- No, I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.
- It's no problem. I'll make a few calls.

1025
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:35,174
No, I couldn't accept it, sir.
I like to earn what I get. I'll find work.

1026
01:00:35,341 --> 01:00:37,009
I respect that.

1027
01:00:37,718 --> 01:00:39,845
You want to make it
on your own steam.

1028
01:00:40,513 --> 01:00:41,847
That's great.

1029
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:45,059
What other skills do you have,
Parker?

1030
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:47,228
I was thinking about photography.

1031
01:00:50,356 --> 01:00:51,607
Hello.

1032
01:00:53,526 --> 01:00:55,820
Let's go! Move it!

1033
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:58,656
Watch the street!

1034
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:01,784
- And this was on the backlot.
- I was just gonna say...

1035
01:01:01,951 --> 01:01:05,538
...we didn't block off the New York
streets for this sequence, but...

1036
01:01:06,372 --> 01:01:08,666
...a good re-creation.

1037
01:01:11,252 --> 01:01:14,255
And then all the stuff
in the Spider-Man suit...

1038
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:17,716
...I had to go back
and loop everything.

1039
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:21,262
You know, go in the studio
with just a microphone...

1040
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:24,557
...and say lines to pictures and stuff.

1041
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:28,853
Crap, crap. Megacrap.

1042
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:30,771
I'll give you $200 for all of them.

1043
01:01:30,938 --> 01:01:33,649
I was disappointed at the premiere,
they laughed so hard...

1044
01:01:33,816 --> 01:01:36,902
...at the first "crap,"
that they missed "mega crap."

1045
01:01:37,069 --> 01:01:38,112
That's it.

1046
01:01:38,279 --> 01:01:41,073
Obviously a very supportive
audience there that night.

1047
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,160
Give you 300.
That's the standard freelance fee.

1048
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:47,663
- Tear up page one. Run that photo.
- Headline?

1049
01:01:47,955 --> 01:01:51,250
"Spider-Man, Hero or Menace?
Exclusive <i>Daily Bugle</i> Photos."

1050
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:56,130
I went and spent couple days hanging
around at the New York Post...

1051
01:01:56,297 --> 01:02:02,303
...soaked up the atmosphere, got the
sense of the big-city newspaper office...

1052
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:05,472
...and what it's like.
And that line about...

1053
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:08,601
...how much I'll give you
for the photos was actually...

1054
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:14,607
...one of the little details
that I gleaned during that process.

1055
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:18,110
- In terms of what standard fees...?
- What's really the going rate for...?

1056
01:02:18,277 --> 01:02:20,738
And how'd we do?
Is it pretty realistic?

1057
01:02:20,905 --> 01:02:21,947
- We changed it.
- Right.

1058
01:02:22,114 --> 01:02:25,576
Because I think it had originally
been something different in the script.

1059
01:02:25,743 --> 01:02:31,707
And here's Elizabeth Banks,
plays Betty Brant...

1060
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:34,960
...a classic...

1061
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:41,008
...Spider-Man relationship
between him and her.

1062
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:44,970
I'm working with her
again in a movie now.

1063
01:02:45,137 --> 01:02:46,180
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1064
01:02:46,347 --> 01:02:50,809
- Now, will she be back in sequels?
- I haven't seen the script...

1065
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:55,189
...but I imagine. I mean, she works at
the Bugle, so she'll at least be there.

1066
01:02:55,356 --> 01:02:57,107
Whether there's
any future with them...

1067
01:02:57,274 --> 01:03:02,571
...I don't know. There's certainly...
Stuff goes on with them in the comics.

1068
01:03:02,738 --> 01:03:06,533
Right. Maybe in the seventh
or eighth sequel, we'll get to that.

1069
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,369
Yes.

1070
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:14,208
I'm basically planning on semi-retiring.
I'll do a Spider-Man every two years.

1071
01:03:14,375 --> 01:03:16,502
- And that's it.
- Hope that'll pay the mortgage.

1072
01:03:16,669 --> 01:03:18,295
Do a little theater here and there.

1073
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:19,505
- Sure.
- Yeah, why not?

1074
01:03:19,672 --> 01:03:24,134
And my kids can go to a state school.
You know, I'll be taking it easy.

1075
01:03:25,052 --> 01:03:28,055
And they pull the company
out from under him.

1076
01:03:28,389 --> 01:03:29,723
...With entrenched management.

1077
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:32,267
The deal is off if you come with it.

1078
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:35,854
The board expects your resignation
in 30 days.

1079
01:03:36,063 --> 01:03:38,023
You can't do this to me.

1080
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:43,487
I started this company.

1081
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:46,949
You know how much I sacrificed?!

1082
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:49,868
He's starting to crack up a little.

1083
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:52,705
A little Mr. Hyde coming out there
in Dr. Jekyll.

1084
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:56,333
Norman, the board is unanimous.

1085
01:03:56,792 --> 01:04:00,796
We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.

1086
01:04:00,963 --> 01:04:02,464
I'm sorry.

1087
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:05,592
You're out, Norman.

1088
01:04:07,803 --> 01:04:13,225
I have a feeling these OSCORP guys
are gonna meet an unhappy ending.

1089
01:04:13,392 --> 01:04:16,353
Something dark
is looming in the future.

1090
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:19,273
They gave him
a little too much information.

1091
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:23,444
They're gonna announce it
right after the Unity Fest.

1092
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:27,948
And here we are in Times Square,
Southern California.

1093
01:04:29,116 --> 01:04:30,659
Yes.

1094
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:35,247
And Peter has his first
non-Spider-Man assignment.

1095
01:04:38,584 --> 01:04:40,669
Macy Gray.

1096
01:04:42,588 --> 01:04:45,549
Coincidentally,
a Columbia recording artist.

1097
01:04:45,716 --> 01:04:47,176
Really?

1098
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:49,845
- Strange how that happens.
- Yes.

1099
01:04:50,012 --> 01:04:53,265
Funny enough, I was promoting
Spider-Man in Europe...

1100
01:04:54,308 --> 01:04:57,394
...and she was touring in Europe
and I bumped into her...

1101
01:04:57,561 --> 01:05:01,815
...in three different countries
while I was promoting Spider-Man...

1102
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:06,904
...and I hung out with her a little bit.
And my friend played in front of her.

1103
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:09,656
A buddy of mine who's a musician...

1104
01:05:10,324 --> 01:05:13,535
...was, you know, just playing
the guitar and singing.

1105
01:05:13,702 --> 01:05:16,663
She was like, "Why don't you
come up and open for me?"

1106
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:20,459
- Get out of here.
- He went up. Swear to God. In England.

1107
01:05:20,626 --> 01:05:23,003
I forgot the theater,
but it was like 5000 people...

1108
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:26,924
...and he walks out on the stage,
just him and his plug-in acoustic...

1109
01:05:27,091 --> 01:05:30,135
...and he played a Beatles song...

1110
01:05:30,302 --> 01:05:31,345
...which I won't hum.

1111
01:05:32,805 --> 01:05:36,058
M.J., would you do me a favor?
I forgot my drink inside.

1112
01:05:39,812 --> 01:05:43,357
A little Spidey-sense. Something...

1113
01:05:46,819 --> 01:05:48,445
What could go wrong
in Times Square?

1114
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:49,613
Right.

1115
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:54,701
- Have you seen my father around?
- Well, I'm not sure if he's coming.

1116
01:05:57,663 --> 01:05:59,832
Oh, I think he's coming.

1117
01:06:06,672 --> 01:06:09,174
- What is that?
- Must be new this year.

1118
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:15,305
What is that?

1119
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:16,557
That's our glider!

1120
01:06:26,275 --> 01:06:28,235
One of the times
when Sam is at his best...

1121
01:06:28,402 --> 01:06:31,697
...Sam Raimi, is doing the scenes
with lots of extras...

1122
01:06:31,864 --> 01:06:36,493
...when he comes out
to inspire them...

1123
01:06:37,828 --> 01:06:40,581
...and try to get the reactions
that he's looking for...

1124
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:45,002
...out of groups of 10, or 20,
or 100 or 4000 people.

1125
01:06:45,544 --> 01:06:47,421
This was such a big job for him too.

1126
01:06:47,588 --> 01:06:52,509
He was directing, like, three or four
units at a time sometimes, you know.

1127
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:54,428
It was unbelievable.

1128
01:06:57,181 --> 01:07:00,893
This shot I like, coming up of the...

1129
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:04,938
- There's Stan. There. Stan the man.
- That was Stan Lee. Right there.

1130
01:07:13,322 --> 01:07:18,368
Peter risking his secret identity
to save a couple people.

1131
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:26,460
- A little bit of a Superman shot.
- The Clark Kent moment there, yeah.

1132
01:07:26,627 --> 01:07:29,546
- Why I loved it though, it was good.
- A little homage.

1133
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:32,549
I was a big Superman fan as a kid.

1134
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:36,470
Well, you know, I was that age.

1135
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:41,058
Very tasteful deaths.

1136
01:07:44,186 --> 01:07:46,063
Hello, my dear.

1137
01:07:47,064 --> 01:07:48,899
It's Spider-Man!

1138
01:07:49,608 --> 01:07:53,403
That was Laura Ziskin's daughter.
Our producer.

1139
01:07:56,823 --> 01:08:01,870
Willem basically was insisting
on doing almost everything himself.

1140
01:08:02,037 --> 01:08:03,330
Yeah?

1141
01:08:03,789 --> 01:08:05,666
And part of the reason was...

1142
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:10,420
...because he's so specific with
his physicality of the character.

1143
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:13,131
And the stuntmen were great, but...

1144
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:18,136
...you know, Willem did it the way
Willem did it, you know.

1145
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:21,348
He really acts
with every ounce of his body.

1146
01:08:22,391 --> 01:08:25,936
And he's very in shape.
He's a seasoned yogi...

1147
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:27,980
...and has a lot of control...

1148
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:30,357
...of his body...

1149
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:35,237
...even though he hit me and
kicked me many times for real.

1150
01:08:35,404 --> 01:08:38,073
Well, he probably meant to.

1151
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:41,660
Yeah. I think so. It was fun.

1152
01:08:41,827 --> 01:08:43,370
But, you know, I'm like...

1153
01:08:44,371 --> 01:08:50,043
...the younger actor
working with the guy I admire...

1154
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:54,047
...and I'm holding up
on my punches, you know.

1155
01:09:17,154 --> 01:09:23,243
Now, both you and Willem had the
constraint of working in those outfits...

1156
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:26,580
...which obviously were
hot and uncomfortable...

1157
01:09:26,747 --> 01:09:30,751
- ...and limited your visibility, et cetera.
- Yeah.

1158
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:36,089
Well, Willem's was
actually fairly heavy, his suit.

1159
01:09:38,216 --> 01:09:41,636
So I know... He had this, like,
special chair between takes...

1160
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:44,598
...so he could relieve
some of the weight of the suit.

1161
01:09:44,765 --> 01:09:46,558
Mine was not that heavy...

1162
01:09:47,351 --> 01:09:51,646
...but it's a one-piece that I couldn't
get in and out of myself...

1163
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:53,690
...and my lenses would fog up
a little...

1164
01:09:53,857 --> 01:09:57,444
- ...so the vision would be restricted.
- Yeah.

1165
01:09:58,362 --> 01:10:01,031
If I ever had to use the restroom
or get a sip of water...

1166
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:03,575
...it was, like, a 30-minute process.

1167
01:10:03,742 --> 01:10:05,786
And the zippers broke all the time.

1168
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:08,330
They weren't even gonna
put zippers on it...

1169
01:10:08,497 --> 01:10:10,665
...and I insisted.

1170
01:10:12,376 --> 01:10:16,463
There were gonna be zippers, but they
weren't gonna put the little handles on.

1171
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:20,175
They did, but they broke anyways.
They ended up stitching me in the suit.

1172
01:10:20,342 --> 01:10:24,471
Sewing the suit up
at least 60 percent of the time.

1173
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:27,849
Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.

1174
01:10:28,392 --> 01:10:31,853
So not a lot of potty breaks on days
you were in the Spider-Man garb?

1175
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:33,313
No.

1176
01:10:34,398 --> 01:10:36,775
But I think it's...
I mean, we went through...

1177
01:10:36,942 --> 01:10:41,655
I went through, like, 30 different
fittings and I went through...

1178
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:47,494
You know, where they cast my body,
which was very uncomfortable...

1179
01:10:47,661 --> 01:10:53,125
...because the guys who did it
did not tell me that the plaster cast...

1180
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:56,169
...would rip hairs out of my body.

1181
01:10:56,336 --> 01:10:59,840
Sounds like you got a plaster cast and
a free body-waxing at the same time.

1182
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:04,344
It was fabulous. And it was
some of the most excruciating pain...

1183
01:11:04,511 --> 01:11:06,138
...I've ever been through.

1184
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:08,723
See, and people think
it's all glamour and parties.

1185
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:14,396
Then I had to stand nearly naked in
front of dozens of people all the time.

1186
01:11:14,563 --> 01:11:17,858
- They'd take photos, computer scans.
- Staring at the intricate details.

1187
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:19,901
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

1188
01:11:20,861 --> 01:11:23,488
Luckily I had been working out
for many months...

1189
01:11:23,655 --> 01:11:27,659
...so, you know,
I was the newly buffed Tobey.

1190
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:32,956
And then they played with
the different graphics on the suit.

1191
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:38,712
Three-dimensional webbing versus
webbing that was just in the design.

1192
01:11:38,879 --> 01:11:41,506
And finally we came up with...

1193
01:11:41,673 --> 01:11:45,844
And face mask versus not
a face mask versus helmet, versus...

1194
01:11:46,011 --> 01:11:49,514
...just the material. And it was
some kind of a spandex y material...

1195
01:11:49,681 --> 01:11:50,724
...Lycra or something.

1196
01:11:51,475 --> 01:11:54,060
And it was pretty...

1197
01:11:55,979 --> 01:12:02,402
You know, it was pretty good
for movement. It was...

1198
01:12:02,569 --> 01:12:06,406
They designed it, because Spider-Man
is such an agile character...

1199
01:12:06,573 --> 01:12:09,451
...so you could move around,
and do flips and run around.

1200
01:12:09,618 --> 01:12:11,286
- Right.
- You know.

1201
01:12:11,453 --> 01:12:16,166
It wasn't as bad as what I heard
that the Batman suit was.

1202
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:19,085
- Apparently, that was...
- Not fun to move in?

1203
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:20,670
Not fun, yeah.

1204
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:22,923
This wasn't so bad.

1205
01:12:25,967 --> 01:12:27,677
He's hearing voices.

1206
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:29,888
<i>Somebody.</i>

1207
01:12:31,223 --> 01:12:32,766
Who said that?

1208
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:36,770
<i>Don't play the innocent with me.</i>

1209
01:12:39,231 --> 01:12:41,900
<i>You've known all along.</i>

1210
01:12:45,904 --> 01:12:47,280
Where are you?

1211
01:12:47,447 --> 01:12:51,576
<i>Follow the cold shiver
running down your spine.</i>

1212
01:12:51,743 --> 01:12:54,621
Willem would, like,
basically never be in his trailer.

1213
01:12:54,788 --> 01:13:00,460
He just always wanted to be in on
the action wandering around the set.

1214
01:13:00,961 --> 01:13:03,004
It was good to see.

1215
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:06,091
He was so involved and invested.

1216
01:13:06,258 --> 01:13:09,844
And I really think
that's what makes this movie fly...

1217
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:12,013
...for me, is that...

1218
01:13:13,598 --> 01:13:17,644
...people are trying to give real
performances within the comic book...

1219
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:20,313
- ...fantasy world.
- Right.

1220
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,650
To say what you won't. To do what...

1221
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:28,029
Yeah, he's a hard-working guy,
pays a lot of attention to detail.

1222
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:32,951
I read an article
that was interesting about...

1223
01:13:34,035 --> 01:13:38,415
You know, and I don't wanna...
I'm going to generalize a little...

1224
01:13:38,582 --> 01:13:40,250
...but how younger actors...

1225
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:41,626
We?

1226
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:45,547
...don't use their bodies
as much nowadays.

1227
01:13:45,714 --> 01:13:49,801
That it's a lot about head acting.

1228
01:13:52,012 --> 01:13:54,472
And it was theorizing that...

1229
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:58,893
...because people came out
of the theater much more...

1230
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:03,690
...years ago, whereas a lot of people
are just going straight into film...

1231
01:14:03,857 --> 01:14:07,527
Right, where it's all about close-ups
and subtlety, yeah.

1232
01:14:07,694 --> 01:14:08,862
In theater you're there.

1233
01:14:09,029 --> 01:14:12,532
Your whole body, people
are watching all of you all the time.

1234
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:16,286
So I think that's why Willem's
such a great choice, is that...

1235
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:18,788
...he really physicalizes
his character.

1236
01:14:19,664 --> 01:14:22,334
That was pretty maniacal.

1237
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,586
- The old Flatiron there.
- Yup.

1238
01:14:24,753 --> 01:14:27,881
- Here we are back there.
- Back in Los Angeles.

1239
01:14:28,048 --> 01:14:31,051
Yeah, back in Los Angeles-slash-L.A.-
-slash-New York.

1240
01:14:31,217 --> 01:14:33,178
We were in Manhattan
three shots ago.

1241
01:14:33,345 --> 01:14:34,721
Now we're in L.A.

1242
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:37,807
How about "Green Meanie"?

1243
01:14:39,184 --> 01:14:42,062
Spider-Man wasn't attacking the city.
That's slander.

1244
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:44,564
It is not. I resent that.

1245
01:14:44,898 --> 01:14:46,566
No reasoning with J. Jonah.

1246
01:14:46,733 --> 01:14:51,279
Do you know what? I really love
what was done with your character.

1247
01:14:51,446 --> 01:14:53,990
I don't know where it came from,
exactly“.

1248
01:14:55,742 --> 01:14:59,412
...but in this scene,
there's some real...

1249
01:14:59,788 --> 01:15:03,667
...redemptive quality about J. Jonah
because he's kind of a hard-ass...

1250
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:07,337
- ...and whatnot, but...
- That was very important to me.

1251
01:15:07,504 --> 01:15:10,590
Sam and I actually met a lot
during preproduction...

1252
01:15:10,757 --> 01:15:13,093
...and talked about the script...

1253
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,805
...and trying not to make this guy
two-dimensional either.

1254
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:18,765
Here he is risking his own life to...

1255
01:15:18,932 --> 01:15:24,521
He's protecting Peter Parker, which
I think is pretty courageous, you know.

1256
01:15:24,688 --> 01:15:29,818
He's like... Oh, he's not such
a bad guy, he's got some courage.

1257
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:36,282
Yeah, he's just got a little burr under
his saddle about old Spider-Man.

1258
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:40,620
In the comic books,
there was something about him.

1259
01:15:40,787 --> 01:15:44,541
He had, like, a big admission
where he says...

1260
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:48,294
Someone was questioning him
or he has some confessional...

1261
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:51,297
...where he says
he doesn't like Spider-Man...

1262
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:56,469
...because Spider-Man is so altruistic
and it's unrealistic or something.

1263
01:15:56,636 --> 01:16:00,140
- And how can anybody be that good?
- Right.

1264
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:02,809
And it made him
feel less about himself.

1265
01:16:02,976 --> 01:16:05,854
Right, exactly.
He's both suspicious and envious.

1266
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:07,230
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1267
01:16:07,397 --> 01:16:09,774
You and I are not so different.

1268
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:12,360
I'm not like you.

1269
01:16:12,736 --> 01:16:15,989
This was a good choice,
to be able to see...

1270
01:16:16,156 --> 01:16:19,033
- See the eyes.
- ...Willem's eyes in this outfit.

1271
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:23,621
Well, and how to carry a film
and keep an audience interested...

1272
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:26,082
...in characters where
you can't see them ever?

1273
01:16:26,249 --> 01:16:27,292
Yeah, yeah.

1274
01:16:27,459 --> 01:16:31,296
And I thought the eyes were good,
to see Willem's eyes.

1275
01:16:31,463 --> 01:16:35,216
And Sam and I talked a lot about
how to keep people...

1276
01:16:35,383 --> 01:16:38,511
...with Peter Parker
even when he was in the mask.

1277
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:44,601
And, you know, it was challenging,
but I guess you just...

1278
01:16:45,143 --> 01:16:50,815
We tried to do it with physicality
and a little bit of dialogue.

1279
01:16:50,982 --> 01:16:56,446
Sometimes he talks to himself
to keep people involved.

1280
01:16:57,197 --> 01:17:02,368
But this is the villain
spouting his philosophies.

1281
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:05,121
- The bad guy credo here.
- Yeah.

1282
01:17:05,288 --> 01:17:10,794
A little bit of the, like Darth Vader,
"Join me."

1283
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:15,131
What we could create.

1284
01:17:15,715 --> 01:17:20,595
Kind of an antagonistic
buddy scene here.

1285
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:26,976
That's, again, one of the admirable
qualities about Peter Parker, is that...

1286
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:30,271
...he doesn't... Not only does
he not go to the dark side...

1287
01:17:30,438 --> 01:17:33,525
...in a big way, but he doesn't
take advantage of his abilities...

1288
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:38,905
...even in small ways for
his own gain, really, like he could.

1289
01:17:39,072 --> 01:17:43,368
Right. And I think that came out
of the wrestling situation...

1290
01:17:43,535 --> 01:17:49,457
...when, you know,
vindictively he let that guy go...

1291
01:17:49,624 --> 01:17:53,920
...and then felt responsible
for his uncle's death.

1292
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:57,090
The responsibility.

1293
01:17:57,257 --> 01:17:59,259
Here we are on the backlot again.

1294
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:00,927
- It's me again.
- Hey!

1295
01:18:01,302 --> 01:18:02,720
How was your audition?

1296
01:18:03,638 --> 01:18:06,099
I have a feeling it's gonna rain.

1297
01:18:06,266 --> 01:18:08,059
- You do?
- I could feel it in the air.

1298
01:18:08,226 --> 01:18:09,853
You know what?

1299
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:14,274
I underst... My senses are tingling.

1300
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:17,569
...Took two buses and a cab
to get in the neighborhood, but...

1301
01:18:18,695 --> 01:18:20,196
So how'd it go?

1302
01:18:22,282 --> 01:18:26,911
Kirsten, she's so great because
she's so beautiful, but so real.

1303
01:18:27,078 --> 01:18:29,873
So beautiful in a
sort of unglamorous...

1304
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:34,377
- ...actual girl next door, you know.
- Definitely.

1305
01:18:34,544 --> 01:18:36,129
Well, that's the thing.

1306
01:18:36,296 --> 01:18:41,134
She is gorgeous and sexy,
but not self-conscious at all.

1307
01:18:41,301 --> 01:18:45,763
Very confident and self-assured...

1308
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:48,308
...and, you know, isn't afraid.

1309
01:18:48,474 --> 01:18:50,894
Never mind.
That's none of my business.

1310
01:18:51,394 --> 01:18:52,896
It's not?

1311
01:18:54,314 --> 01:18:55,982
Why so interested?

1312
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:58,151
I'm not.

1313
01:18:58,401 --> 01:18:59,777
You're not?

1314
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:04,157
This is some of the most fun I had,
is doing my scenes with her.

1315
01:19:05,116 --> 01:19:08,661
She just gives you so much.
It's amazing because...

1316
01:19:08,912 --> 01:19:10,914
I'm trying to think. I think she was 18...

1317
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:15,335
...when we started the picture and
then turned 19 during production.

1318
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:18,087
That's what amazing too.
She's been around for so long.

1319
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:21,215
- Not unlike her co-star, actually.
- Right.

1320
01:19:21,382 --> 01:19:25,428
Somebody that has...
You know, when I was your age...

1321
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:28,097
...I think I was doing summer stock
in Montana.

1322
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:32,393
But people like you and Kirsten,
who started at such a young age...

1323
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,438
- I think she even younger than you.
- Yeah. I can't remember...

1324
01:19:35,605 --> 01:19:38,733
...but 3, or 5, or 6,
somewhere really young.

1325
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:42,695
- And I started when I was, like, 13.
- Yeah, you were an old guy.

1326
01:19:42,862 --> 01:19:46,115
- You were almost growed up.
- Yeah. That's right.

1327
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:55,041
This is similar to the screen test
that I did.

1328
01:19:58,836 --> 01:20:00,296
Get off me!

1329
01:20:06,552 --> 01:20:09,222
Very professional stuntmen.
She was never in danger.

1330
01:20:09,389 --> 01:20:11,557
Although this was one
of her favorite scenes...

1331
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:14,060
...because she got to
kick some butt.

1332
01:20:29,409 --> 01:20:32,453
This is a fun shot here.
I had to run...

1333
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:36,499
...in here and I jumped up
in this little trapdoor they had.

1334
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:38,292
Then they shut the door
behind me...

1335
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:41,504
...spin around,
and a double dropped down...

1336
01:20:41,671 --> 01:20:42,714
...all in one shot.

1337
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,800
Then it's me. And then they cut
and come in closer, and it's me.

1338
01:20:45,967 --> 01:20:50,304
And Kirsten... This is our
big kiss moment coming up.

1339
01:20:50,471 --> 01:20:52,724
The much talked about
upside-down kiss.

1340
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:54,642
When we shot her
close-up coverage...

1341
01:20:54,809 --> 01:20:56,936
...it was before...
I was actually standing...

1342
01:20:57,103 --> 01:20:59,272
...right side up for part of it.

1343
01:21:01,357 --> 01:21:04,110
And she leans off camera...

1344
01:21:04,777 --> 01:21:06,404
...when he comes up.

1345
01:21:06,571 --> 01:21:10,366
And she planted one on me.

1346
01:21:11,117 --> 01:21:13,953
- It really is a tough business, isn't it?
- Yeah, it was tough.

1347
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,872
I will say
that was the enjoyable one.

1348
01:21:16,039 --> 01:21:19,375
When I was actually upside down,
I couldn't breathe.

1349
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:23,629
- Water was pouring down.
- See the veins popping out of his neck.

1350
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:26,049
I mean, it couldn't have been
more uncomfortable.

1351
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:28,718
I literally couldn't breathe.
I apologized to Kirsten:

1352
01:21:28,885 --> 01:21:31,429
"Listen, I'm gonna have to
suck air out of the side...

1353
01:21:31,596 --> 01:21:35,808
...of our mouths."
Because right there...

1354
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:39,228
...the mask is rolled up
to my nose and the mask is wet...

1355
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:43,566
...so it's no longer breathable at all. I
could only breathe through my mouth...

1356
01:21:43,733 --> 01:21:47,528
...and then I was kissing her,
so there was nowhere to breathe.

1357
01:21:47,695 --> 01:21:51,449
It was unbearable. And it was,
like, 4:30, 5 in the morning.

1358
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,992
Of course, yeah.

1359
01:21:55,161 --> 01:21:58,498
- Good shot. Oh, yeah, definitely.
- Worth it though, great shot.

1360
01:21:58,664 --> 01:22:00,583
Absolutely.

1361
01:22:05,004 --> 01:22:06,339
Now, this is not the backlot.

1362
01:22:06,506 --> 01:22:10,676
No. And this was New York,
as well.

1363
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:20,436
Yeah. Again, this is a scene that we've
seen versions of this a million times.

1364
01:22:20,603 --> 01:22:24,023
And maybe it's just because
I'm a dad now but, you know...

1365
01:22:24,190 --> 01:22:28,528
And I apologize for not knowing
this actress's name but she's...

1366
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:31,531
...a New York actress that,
you know, works all the time.

1367
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:34,617
She's great. And I've seen her
in a couple other things too.

1368
01:22:34,784 --> 01:22:37,954
She's like one of those people,
you know.

1369
01:22:38,121 --> 01:22:44,127
You're in the business, you're privy
to watching people's careers grow.

1370
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:46,379
And she was so good.

1371
01:22:46,546 --> 01:22:49,715
And then I saw her in
a couple other movies or TV shows...

1372
01:22:50,007 --> 01:22:52,593
...I'm not sure what,
and I went, "Wow."

1373
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:55,972
I bet she's gonna do
really, really well.

1374
01:22:58,307 --> 01:22:59,475
No!

1375
01:23:07,191 --> 01:23:11,195
- It's okay. Your baby's fine.
- Oh, my baby!

1376
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:15,158
God bless you, Spider-Man.
Bless you.

1377
01:23:17,076 --> 01:23:19,579
- Spider-Man is wanted.
- Right.

1378
01:23:20,246 --> 01:23:22,874
A lot of these guys
that play New York's finest...

1379
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,084
...and/or New York's bravest...

1380
01:23:25,251 --> 01:23:27,920
...in these movies
actually are New York cops...

1381
01:23:28,087 --> 01:23:29,881
...or New York firefighters.

1382
01:23:31,924 --> 01:23:33,634
I don't know
either one of these guys.

1383
01:23:33,801 --> 01:23:35,928
- I don't know if they are.
- Yeah, I'm not sure.

1384
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:41,726
But, yeah, we have a combination
of actors and the real deal.

1385
01:23:42,059 --> 01:23:43,769
Where are you?

1386
01:23:45,813 --> 01:23:47,398
Where are you?

1387
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:52,820
Of course all of my dialogue
is looped.

1388
01:23:54,447 --> 01:23:58,784
That's a whole different challenge,
being in the recording studio...

1389
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:02,788
...five months later
and having to try and re-create...

1390
01:24:02,955 --> 01:24:06,125
...the same level of involvement.

1391
01:24:06,292 --> 01:24:10,463
You're pathetically predictable.
Like a moth to the flame.

1392
01:24:10,671 --> 01:24:14,926
You end up doing that in just about
every movie you do, even if it's just...

1393
01:24:15,092 --> 01:24:17,428
...sitting around a table talking,
there's always...

1394
01:24:17,595 --> 01:24:20,973
For one reason or another, there's
always some re-recording to do.

1395
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:24,310
Yeah, you always do it,
but this was very heavy.

1396
01:24:24,727 --> 01:24:26,229
Oh, great.

1397
01:24:27,939 --> 01:24:29,315
Yeah.

1398
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:32,151
This was a cool shot.

1399
01:24:33,277 --> 01:24:35,529
How'd you get your body
to do that in slow motion?

1400
01:24:35,696 --> 01:24:37,740
- You're amazing.
- Oh, thanks.

1401
01:24:37,907 --> 01:24:40,910
- Yeah, in all of that fire too.
- Yeah.

1402
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:48,960
To be honest with you...

1403
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:53,798
...a lot of times in the movie, I can't
tell when it's me or a stuntman. I swear.

1404
01:24:54,674 --> 01:24:56,968
Because a lot of times,
we would both do things.

1405
01:24:57,134 --> 01:24:58,761
- Right.
- You know, because...

1406
01:25:00,179 --> 01:25:02,265
...we wanted it to be me
and sometimes...

1407
01:25:02,431 --> 01:25:06,185
...there were things I couldn't do
as well as the stuntman...

1408
01:25:06,352 --> 01:25:08,312
- ...and we would both try it.
- Yeah.

1409
01:25:10,231 --> 01:25:13,526
And at first, you know,
I would be all gung ho and say:

1410
01:25:13,693 --> 01:25:15,152
"I wanna do it! I wanna do it!"

1411
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:18,447
And they would be...
You know, Sam and Laura...

1412
01:25:19,657 --> 01:25:21,534
...would discourage me, you know:

1413
01:25:21,701 --> 01:25:25,371
"We don't really need you
to do this one and it's dangerous."

1414
01:25:25,538 --> 01:25:28,040
And by the end of the film
I was like:

1415
01:25:28,207 --> 01:25:32,295
- "No, just let him do it." You know?
- Yeah, "Bring in the double."

1416
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:35,965
- Well, it was a long shoot for you.
- It was a very long shoot, yeah.

1417
01:25:38,592 --> 01:25:42,305
And I'll say, another person
behind the scenes...

1418
01:25:43,514 --> 01:25:46,225
...who really cares
about the character...

1419
01:25:46,976 --> 01:25:49,395
...and had a lot of great input
was Avi Arad...

1420
01:25:49,562 --> 01:25:54,233
...who's the head of... I believe
he's the head of Marvel Entertainment.

1421
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,861
I mean, I don't know his actual title.

1422
01:25:57,570 --> 01:26:00,323
But, you know, these characters
are his babies.

1423
01:26:00,823 --> 01:26:06,287
And he just did a fine job
working with everybody on this movie.

1424
01:26:06,454 --> 01:26:10,416
And he's gotta be one of the most
prolific producers in Hollywood now...

1425
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:13,002
...with all of his Marvel movies.
It's unbelievable.

1426
01:26:13,169 --> 01:26:16,505
And he's... The thing about Marvel...

1427
01:26:17,006 --> 01:26:19,091
...characters...

1428
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:23,095
...is that they are relatable,
they are human. They're not...

1429
01:26:23,262 --> 01:26:25,681
...you know, perfect heroes...

1430
01:26:25,848 --> 01:26:28,517
...and just evil villains.

1431
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:30,770
This was actually
one of the hardest stunts...

1432
01:26:30,936 --> 01:26:32,938
...just being up on that wall.

1433
01:26:33,105 --> 01:26:35,775
As hard as that... On the ceiling.
As hard as that...

1434
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:38,110
And bleeding, always a drag
when they cut you...

1435
01:26:38,277 --> 01:26:40,571
- ...and you have to bleed.
- Right, of course.

1436
01:26:40,738 --> 01:26:44,325
Then you gotta rehydrate and you can't
take a potty break because of the suit.

1437
01:27:01,801 --> 01:27:05,137
- Great shot here too.
- Yeah.

1438
01:27:09,475 --> 01:27:12,103
- Hey, everyone.
- Oh, Peter!

1439
01:27:12,269 --> 01:27:15,981
Sorry I'm late, it's a jungle out there.
I had to beat an old lady with a stick...

1440
01:27:16,148 --> 01:27:19,026
Yeah, now, was that in the script,
or was that...?

1441
01:27:19,527 --> 01:27:23,906
I can't remember. I think it might have
been something Sam came up with.

1442
01:27:24,073 --> 01:27:28,035
It was really loose. You know,
going into this film, I'm thinking...

1443
01:27:28,202 --> 01:27:30,287
...you know, super big budget...

1444
01:27:31,539 --> 01:27:33,999
...you know, potential franchise...

1445
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:38,754
...movie series for the studio.

1446
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:42,842
It's gonna be really a lot of chefs
in the kitchen.

1447
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:49,014
But they really gave us a tremendous
amount of freedom to play around.

1448
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:51,016
That's what was great
about this film.

1449
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:55,938
You know, I really went in going,
"Okay, be prepared for anything."

1450
01:27:56,105 --> 01:27:59,358
Because I hadn't done a film like this.
But it was the most freedom...

1451
01:27:59,525 --> 01:28:01,902
...I think I'd had on any film...

1452
01:28:02,069 --> 01:28:03,529
...which was pretty great.

1453
01:28:03,696 --> 01:28:06,949
I stepped off a curb and got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.

1454
01:28:07,116 --> 01:28:08,659
Well, let me see.

1455
01:28:08,868 --> 01:28:10,453
Oh, my goodness.

1456
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:14,707
We discussed doing a Spidey-sense
moment here at the table.

1457
01:28:14,874 --> 01:28:17,710
But despite our budget,
we couldn't afford it.

1458
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:21,380
That's the amazing thing
about movies.

1459
01:28:21,547 --> 01:28:23,883
No matter what the budget is,
it's never enough.

1460
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:25,885
There's a top to it.

1461
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:31,140
Whether you're on a 5-million-dollar...
I've been on $400,000 movies.

1462
01:28:31,307 --> 01:28:35,394
And this one that, you know, they
won't even tell you how much it cost.

1463
01:28:35,561 --> 01:28:37,271
And it's never enough.

1464
01:28:37,438 --> 01:28:39,732
- I've got to go.
- Why?

1465
01:28:40,149 --> 01:28:43,527
Something
has come to my attention.

1466
01:28:43,736 --> 01:28:44,987
Are you all right?

1467
01:28:45,571 --> 01:28:51,368
He has just discovered the identity
of Spider-Man.

1468
01:28:53,037 --> 01:28:56,582
I planned this so you'd meet M.J...

1469
01:28:56,874 --> 01:28:59,585
Well, I guess that's it, then.
Spider-Man's gonna be outed.

1470
01:28:59,793 --> 01:29:01,337
Yeah.

1471
01:29:01,504 --> 01:29:04,006
That's it. And here's...

1472
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:08,177
...Harry Osborn
getting a little insensitive too.

1473
01:29:09,261 --> 01:29:14,475
Yeah, it's hard to confront
the old dad figure too much here.

1474
01:29:14,642 --> 01:29:17,019
- Yeah.
- He sort of loses his backbone.

1475
01:29:17,228 --> 01:29:18,521
You're wrong about her, Dad.

1476
01:29:19,021 --> 01:29:22,191
A word to the not-so-wise
about your little girlfriend:

1477
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:25,069
Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.

1478
01:29:36,705 --> 01:29:39,208
Thanks for sticking up for me,
Harry.

1479
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:42,378
- You heard?
- Everyone heard that creep.

1480
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:46,465
That creep is my father.
With luck, I'll be half of what he is.

1481
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:49,051
Shut up about stuff
you don't understand!

1482
01:29:49,218 --> 01:29:50,886
Harry Osborn!

1483
01:29:51,971 --> 01:29:54,014
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

1484
01:29:56,976 --> 01:30:00,312
<i>Spider-Man is all but invincible.</i>

1485
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:03,649
<i>But Parker, we can destroy him.</i>

1486
01:30:03,816 --> 01:30:08,279
Getting advice from himself.
"Attack the heart."

1487
01:30:08,571 --> 01:30:10,823
<i>Parker must be educated.</i>

1488
01:30:12,992 --> 01:30:14,285
What do I do?

1489
01:30:14,827 --> 01:30:19,415
I think it's the merging of
the characters within himself. He's...

1490
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:23,335
Yes?

1491
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:28,674
He's starting to accept his... The evil
side is his more dominant side now.

1492
01:30:28,841 --> 01:30:32,011
<i>...Warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.</i>

1493
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:33,512
Tell me how!

1494
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:35,848
<i>The heart, Osborn.</i>

1495
01:30:36,098 --> 01:30:39,143
<i>First, we attack his heart.</i>

1496
01:30:42,938 --> 01:30:45,190
In this scene, Aunt May.

1497
01:30:45,357 --> 01:30:47,735
...And forgive us our trespasses...

1498
01:30:48,569 --> 01:30:52,740
Yeah, it's a great... The characters,
both Aunt May and Uncle Ben have...

1499
01:30:52,906 --> 01:30:56,368
...a great combination
of wisdom and innocence.

1500
01:30:56,535 --> 01:30:57,953
Yeah, absolutely.

1501
01:30:58,787 --> 01:31:02,249
And Uncle Ben is really kept alive...

1502
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:08,255
...throughout the movie and throughout
the comic books he was too.

1503
01:31:13,594 --> 01:31:15,763
Two milligrams IV.

1504
01:31:17,556 --> 01:31:18,807
Get the BP.

1505
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:22,811
Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay?
What happened?

1506
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:24,355
You have to leave.

1507
01:31:24,521 --> 01:31:26,231
- What happened?
- Those eyes!

1508
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:30,486
Those horrible yellow eyes!

1509
01:31:35,324 --> 01:31:37,868
He knows who I am.

1510
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:41,789
Peter gets caught up.

1511
01:31:47,419 --> 01:31:51,590
Feeling responsible once again
for a loved one.

1512
01:31:51,757 --> 01:31:55,761
That was a great little shot there
of you actually saying the line:

1513
01:31:55,928 --> 01:31:58,472
"He knows who I am."
Because it was so important...

1514
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:01,767
...to make that... Most people probably
would have understood that...

1515
01:32:01,934 --> 01:32:05,604
...with just what you were doing
with your face...

1516
01:32:05,771 --> 01:32:09,900
...but I'm sure Sam felt it was
important to make it very clear.

1517
01:32:10,067 --> 01:32:13,987
And it was good, I think,
not to bring back in the voice-over...

1518
01:32:14,154 --> 01:32:16,156
...idea too much
throughout the movie.

1519
01:32:16,323 --> 01:32:18,951
To just use that
as a kind of a bookend device.

1520
01:32:19,118 --> 01:32:25,416
Yeah. There was a lot of discussion
about when Peter should realize...

1521
01:32:26,792 --> 01:32:32,089
...that Norman figured it out.

1522
01:32:33,424 --> 01:32:36,176
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

1523
01:32:40,347 --> 01:32:43,267
How are you?
You okay about the other night?

1524
01:32:43,434 --> 01:32:47,104
Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad
about leaving Aunt May.

1525
01:32:47,354 --> 01:32:50,315
- Have you talked to Harry?
- He called me.

1526
01:32:50,774 --> 01:32:52,943
I haven't called him back.

1527
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:59,658
Yeah, and here again in the middle of
this quote-unquote action movie...

1528
01:32:59,825 --> 01:33:04,246
...you know, we have a really nice
extended scene here...

1529
01:33:06,957 --> 01:33:09,334
...about the characters...

1530
01:33:09,752 --> 01:33:12,671
...and what's going on in their lives.

1531
01:33:12,838 --> 01:33:15,591
There's so many different...

1532
01:33:16,133 --> 01:33:17,384
It's funny.

1533
01:33:17,551 --> 01:33:19,803
...you know...

1534
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:22,765
...stories going on within this.

1535
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:28,687
And it's actually a pretty complex,
epic sort of film.

1536
01:33:30,272 --> 01:33:33,567
But do you think it's true, all the
terrible things they say about him?

1537
01:33:33,734 --> 01:33:37,070
That nice little shot of Aunt May
actually being awake now.

1538
01:33:37,237 --> 01:33:39,782
- Yeah, eavesdropping.
- Listening in to the whole thing.

1539
01:33:39,948 --> 01:33:42,409
I'm sort of his unofficial
photographer.

1540
01:33:42,701 --> 01:33:44,745
Which would be kind of skeevy...

1541
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:47,664
...if it wasn't somebody
as sweet as Aunt May.

1542
01:33:49,416 --> 01:33:50,501
Here's...

1543
01:33:52,211 --> 01:33:57,549
...Peter getting himself
in a little bit of a pickle. Going into...

1544
01:33:57,716 --> 01:34:00,135
Speaking in third person
of his alter ego.

1545
01:34:00,302 --> 01:34:05,015
This is really one of the great romantic
little speeches here, though.

1546
01:34:05,182 --> 01:34:06,934
- It's really nice.
- Yeah, it was nice.

1547
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:08,936
We did a lot of work on the dialogue.

1548
01:34:09,102 --> 01:34:11,730
It was very...

1549
01:34:12,397 --> 01:34:14,066
...tricky.

1550
01:34:16,443 --> 01:34:19,655
...And she's looking back in yours...

1551
01:34:20,155 --> 01:34:22,658
There it is. When you have...

1552
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:27,120
...someone great to work with like
Kirsten, it makes it so much easier.

1553
01:34:27,287 --> 01:34:29,706
Right. Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's...

1554
01:34:29,873 --> 01:34:33,085
You're doing all the talking,
but it's so much a two-person scene.

1555
01:34:33,252 --> 01:34:35,796
- Yeah. Yeah.
- She contributes so much to it.

1556
01:34:35,963 --> 01:34:40,300
You can see her, like, progressively
opening and getting touched.

1557
01:34:40,467 --> 01:34:42,219
And then that...

1558
01:34:43,554 --> 01:34:46,932
...feeds me and informs my stuff.

1559
01:34:47,766 --> 01:34:52,062
The truth is, you don't know
what you feel...

1560
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:57,109
...except you know what kind of man
you want to be.

1561
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:01,697
It's as if you've...

1562
01:35:02,322 --> 01:35:05,492
...reached the unreachable...

1563
01:35:07,077 --> 01:35:09,788
...and you weren't ready for it."

1564
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:15,002
You said that?

1565
01:35:15,794 --> 01:35:18,130
Well, something like that.

1566
01:35:18,797 --> 01:35:20,465
There's the little comic relief.

1567
01:35:20,632 --> 01:35:24,428
Yeah, little backpedal. "Yeah, you
know, something like that. Whatever."

1568
01:35:27,723 --> 01:35:31,476
It's great working with actors too,
and it's not always the case, where...

1569
01:35:31,643 --> 01:35:35,147
Obviously, when this scene is shot,
they point the camera on you...

1570
01:35:35,314 --> 01:35:38,150
...and do the whole scene,
then they turn everything around...

1571
01:35:38,317 --> 01:35:41,653
...take their four hours to light it,
and they point the camera on her.

1572
01:35:42,613 --> 01:35:44,489
But often times,
or at least sometimes...

1573
01:35:44,656 --> 01:35:47,743
...you work with other actors who,
when the camera's not on them...

1574
01:35:47,910 --> 01:35:50,787
...they kind of show up
and sit there and aren't really...

1575
01:35:50,954 --> 01:35:53,874
...contributing much
to what you're doing.

1576
01:35:54,041 --> 01:35:57,711
But it's obvious that you guys
were working for each other a lot.

1577
01:35:57,878 --> 01:36:00,797
Well, I've heard a lot of stories
about that kind of thing.

1578
01:36:00,964 --> 01:36:05,636
And I've been fortunate enough not to
have had to experience it too much.

1579
01:36:07,262 --> 01:36:12,184
Yeah, it's not... I mean, only
a few times that I've felt that way...

1580
01:36:12,351 --> 01:36:14,978
...about another actor.

1581
01:36:16,521 --> 01:36:18,607
Nobody in this movie.

1582
01:36:18,774 --> 01:36:20,442
No.

1583
01:36:21,652 --> 01:36:23,445
Well, you were right about M.J.

1584
01:36:23,737 --> 01:36:26,531
- Except for maybe Ted Raimi.
- Yeah, that guy. I don't know.

1585
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:28,575
- How did he get the job?
- I don't know.

1586
01:36:28,742 --> 01:36:32,496
- What was the deal there?
- It was just a good audition, I think.

1587
01:36:32,663 --> 01:36:34,623
And how does he feel about her?

1588
01:36:37,209 --> 01:36:39,753
He's loved her since the 4th grade.

1589
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:45,968
He pretends like he doesn't, but
there's no one Peter cares for more.

1590
01:36:47,427 --> 01:36:51,223
A little bonding moment
for father and son.

1591
01:36:51,390 --> 01:36:52,891
Yeah, they keep trying.

1592
01:36:53,058 --> 01:36:56,019
I haven't always been there for you,
Havel?

1593
01:36:58,313 --> 01:37:01,525
You're busy. You're an important man.
I understand.

1594
01:37:01,733 --> 01:37:03,527
That's no excuse.

1595
01:37:04,528 --> 01:37:06,321
I'm proud of you.

1596
01:37:06,863 --> 01:37:11,743
I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But I'll make it up to you.

1597
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:15,247
I'm going to rectify
certain inequities.

1598
01:37:29,302 --> 01:37:31,096
<i>Wake up, little spider.</i>

1599
01:37:31,263 --> 01:37:32,764
Wake up.

1600
01:37:34,099 --> 01:37:35,684
Go home, dear.

1601
01:37:35,892 --> 01:37:37,227
You look awful.

1602
01:37:37,436 --> 01:37:39,730
- And you look beautiful.
- Well, thank you.

1603
01:37:39,938 --> 01:37:43,233
- I don't like to leave you here.
- But I'm safe here.

1604
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:46,111
- Can I do anything for you?
- You do too much.

1605
01:37:46,278 --> 01:37:51,825
College, a job, all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.

1606
01:37:52,576 --> 01:37:54,327
A smile. Finally.

1607
01:37:54,494 --> 01:37:57,748
Haven't seen one of those on
your face since Mary Jane was here.

1608
01:37:57,914 --> 01:38:01,293
Hey.
You were supposed to be asleep.

1609
01:38:02,085 --> 01:38:06,882
You know, you were about 6 years old
when M.J.'s family moved in next door.

1610
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:11,053
And when she got out of the car,
and you saw her for the first time...

1611
01:38:11,219 --> 01:38:14,639
It reminded me when she said
"you're not Superman" of the trailer.

1612
01:38:14,806 --> 01:38:19,311
I think the people who cut the trailer
in the Marketing Department...

1613
01:38:19,478 --> 01:38:23,440
...did such a good job, because
obviously the awareness was...

1614
01:38:23,607 --> 01:38:25,358
...very high.

1615
01:38:25,525 --> 01:38:29,154
But they also did a good job
of not giving away the entire movie.

1616
01:38:29,321 --> 01:38:32,616
Yes, which is a real pet peeve of mine.
It was a really good trailer.

1617
01:38:32,783 --> 01:38:36,578
- It was a good trailer.
- It gave you a real sense of it without...

1618
01:38:37,204 --> 01:38:38,914
Not giving away the whole thing, yeah.

1619
01:38:39,081 --> 01:38:41,833
Tell me, would it be so dangerous...

1620
01:38:42,042 --> 01:38:46,004
...to let Mary Jane know
how much you care?

1621
01:38:46,421 --> 01:38:48,924
Everybody else knows.

1622
01:38:51,968 --> 01:38:53,220
I'll be right back.

1623
01:38:53,887 --> 01:38:55,180
But...

1624
01:39:02,521 --> 01:39:04,523
Come on, pick up.

1625
01:39:04,689 --> 01:39:07,984
<i>- Hey, M.J...
- Sing your song at the beep.</i>

1626
01:39:09,069 --> 01:39:10,737
By the machine.

1627
01:39:11,363 --> 01:39:14,199
Hello? You there?

1628
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:19,204
I'm just calling to check up on you.
Will you call me when you get in?

1629
01:39:19,371 --> 01:39:20,789
All right, well...

1630
01:39:20,956 --> 01:39:22,249
Don't...

1631
01:39:23,041 --> 01:39:25,252
Don't go up any dark alleys.

1632
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:26,962
Hello?

1633
01:39:29,381 --> 01:39:33,093
<i>Can Spider-Man come out to play?</i>

1634
01:39:33,301 --> 01:39:35,053
Where is she?

1635
01:39:40,976 --> 01:39:44,062
Well, she's on top
of the Brooklyn Bridge.

1636
01:39:53,071 --> 01:39:56,324
Was it the Brooklyn Bridge?

1637
01:39:56,992 --> 01:39:59,369
I think so.
Now, a lot of this was done...

1638
01:39:59,536 --> 01:40:01,746
...on the sound stage
or in green screen...

1639
01:40:01,913 --> 01:40:06,084
- ...but you did some on location too?
- Yes. Yeah.

1640
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:23,935
If that's the tram, I guess it's probably
the 59th Street Bridge, isn't it?

1641
01:40:24,102 --> 01:40:27,355
I don't think it's the Brooklyn Bridge.
Is there a Queensboro Bridge?

1642
01:40:27,522 --> 01:40:29,816
The Queensboro Bridge
is the 59th Street Bridge.

1643
01:40:29,983 --> 01:40:31,568
There you go.

1644
01:40:43,872 --> 01:40:45,957
This is a very cruel choice...

1645
01:40:46,124 --> 01:40:50,629
...that the Goblin
proposes to Spider-Man.

1646
01:40:52,130 --> 01:40:53,965
In a moment.

1647
01:40:56,134 --> 01:40:59,638
Now, this whole sequence
is so complicated with...

1648
01:40:59,804 --> 01:41:02,724
...you know, sound stage,
green screen...

1649
01:41:02,891 --> 01:41:05,852
...shooting it
on actually the location...

1650
01:41:06,019 --> 01:41:09,814
...and then the animation.

1651
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:19,783
Yeah, filmmaking has changed
and evolved a little bit.

1652
01:41:19,950 --> 01:41:22,077
It's not pointing
the camera at actors anymore.

1653
01:41:22,244 --> 01:41:23,578
No.

1654
01:41:33,004 --> 01:41:34,673
Yeah, this was great.

1655
01:41:34,839 --> 01:41:39,010
Contrast that with the first sequence
where he's chasing the carjacker...

1656
01:41:39,177 --> 01:41:42,180
...and trying to get a handle
on his abilities...

1657
01:41:42,347 --> 01:41:44,933
...and now he's completely
in command.

1658
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:47,686
Let die the woman you love...

1659
01:41:52,065 --> 01:41:57,153
...or suffer the little children.

1660
01:41:57,779 --> 01:41:59,197
Kirsten...

1661
01:41:59,364 --> 01:42:01,700
You know, Sam asked Kirsten,
he said:

1662
01:42:01,866 --> 01:42:03,868
"There's a lot of stunts and wire work.

1663
01:42:04,035 --> 01:42:06,788
And are you in shape and prepared...

1664
01:42:06,955 --> 01:42:10,625
...to do this and get beat up a little?"
She was like, "Yeah. No problem."

1665
01:42:10,792 --> 01:42:13,461
And I'm thinking, "Come on,
I'm playing Spider-Man.

1666
01:42:13,628 --> 01:42:15,672
What does this girl gotta do?"
You know?

1667
01:42:15,839 --> 01:42:19,009
And I think that she probably...

1668
01:42:19,634 --> 01:42:22,554
...had to do as much, if not more.
I love that shot.

1669
01:42:22,721 --> 01:42:24,514
- Yeah. Yeah.
- So cool.

1670
01:42:24,681 --> 01:42:26,558
She had to do as much,
if not more...

1671
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:31,104
...stunt stuff...

1672
01:42:31,271 --> 01:42:34,024
...stunt work than I did.

1673
01:42:44,326 --> 01:42:47,871
This was a bit
of an excruciating sequence.

1674
01:42:48,246 --> 01:42:51,875
We're on a sound stage,
hanging from wires all day long.

1675
01:42:52,042 --> 01:42:54,919
- Holding a 6-inch ram in one arm.
- Yeah, of course.

1676
01:42:55,086 --> 01:42:56,796
- Right.
- That'll wear you out.

1677
01:42:56,963 --> 01:42:59,924
The secret there
is the core strength.

1678
01:43:00,842 --> 01:43:03,762
We're gonna bring the barge
right under you.

1679
01:43:11,269 --> 01:43:15,398
- He's coming back!
- Listen. I need you to climb down.

1680
01:43:15,565 --> 01:43:17,067
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

1681
01:43:22,155 --> 01:43:25,200
M.J., you can do it. You have to.

1682
01:43:25,367 --> 01:43:26,951
Trust me.

1683
01:43:27,619 --> 01:43:32,207
That's another real acting challenge.
You know, we were talking about...

1684
01:43:32,374 --> 01:43:35,126
...the whole crying scene,
emotional scenes.

1685
01:43:35,293 --> 01:43:38,338
You know, to do this
damsel-in-distress thing...

1686
01:43:38,505 --> 01:43:43,176
...you know, that Kirsten does here
and maintain that level of panic...

1687
01:43:44,302 --> 01:43:47,305
...you know, for what
I'm sure was a few days...

1688
01:43:47,472 --> 01:43:49,849
- ...of shooting this sequence.
- Oh, yeah.

1689
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:55,647
Then also at Times Square on the
balcony, she had to do all that stuff.

1690
01:43:59,401 --> 01:44:01,986
That's another great shot here.

1691
01:44:08,993 --> 01:44:11,621
- He's not gonna make it.
- He's gonna make it!

1692
01:44:13,832 --> 01:44:16,543
We had all the people...

1693
01:44:17,335 --> 01:44:21,172
...doubting Spider-Man
with J. Jonah's...

1694
01:44:22,424 --> 01:44:23,925
- ...headlines.
- Right.

1695
01:44:24,092 --> 01:44:27,470
You know, they're not sure where
Spider-Man's coming from, if he's...

1696
01:44:28,596 --> 01:44:30,432
...a good guy or a bad guy.

1697
01:44:31,558 --> 01:44:33,768
That really always continues
to be the story...

1698
01:44:33,935 --> 01:44:35,603
...of Peter Parker and Spider-Man.

1699
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:39,858
He's never universally acclaimed
like Superman...

1700
01:44:40,024 --> 01:44:42,861
...or some other superheroes.
There's always...

1701
01:44:43,486 --> 01:44:45,947
...a significant group of people that...

1702
01:44:46,739 --> 01:44:49,951
But here's a moment
where he gets some support...

1703
01:44:50,118 --> 01:44:54,289
...which is encouragement for him
that he's on the right path.

1704
01:44:54,456 --> 01:44:56,833
Because it makes
him question himself earlier.

1705
01:44:59,544 --> 01:45:01,337
Spider-Man, watch out!

1706
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:11,222
- But the moment of victory is short.
- Yeah.

1707
01:45:17,479 --> 01:45:20,440
Now, this is the sequence
where I got beat up the most.

1708
01:45:20,607 --> 01:45:21,858
Yeah, this...

1709
01:45:23,401 --> 01:45:26,404
That's a cool effect.

1710
01:45:32,327 --> 01:45:36,748
This is where Willem was not
entirely pulling his punches...

1711
01:45:36,915 --> 01:45:38,082
...coming up here.

1712
01:45:38,875 --> 01:45:42,378
When did you shoot this? Toward the
end that you shot this sequence or...?

1713
01:45:43,213 --> 01:45:47,091
We came back to it a couple times,
but I do believe it was towards the end.

1714
01:45:47,759 --> 01:45:51,304
And it was really dusty
and smoky and...

1715
01:45:51,471 --> 01:45:54,933
As you see, they had to put lots
of blood and sweat all over me...

1716
01:45:55,099 --> 01:45:57,101
...and I'm in the suit. And dirt.

1717
01:45:57,268 --> 01:45:59,395
Yeah, that's another element
that adds to...

1718
01:46:01,272 --> 01:46:03,107
- ...a long day.
- Yeah.

1719
01:46:03,274 --> 01:46:05,193
Then I had to get beat up a lot.

1720
01:46:08,112 --> 01:46:11,282
Then I'd have to go back and do
looping and make all these little...

1721
01:46:13,618 --> 01:46:17,121
...noises. Try to vary
the grunts and efforts.

1722
01:46:19,624 --> 01:46:24,254
And that right there is where I got
some nice little bruises on my ribs.

1723
01:46:25,171 --> 01:46:28,132
I had to throw myself into bricks.

1724
01:46:28,299 --> 01:46:31,135
Many times.

1725
01:46:35,723 --> 01:46:37,809
He might be done for.

1726
01:46:38,476 --> 01:46:40,812
Yup. No sequels.

1727
01:46:41,479 --> 01:46:43,314
Spider-Man's gonna buy it.

1728
01:46:43,481 --> 01:46:46,776
But now that you've really
pissed me off...

1729
01:46:47,485 --> 01:46:50,196
He makes the mistake...

1730
01:46:50,572 --> 01:46:53,992
...talking about torturing
the woman he loves.

1731
01:46:56,452 --> 01:46:58,496
M.J. and I...

1732
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:02,625
...we're gonna have a hell of a time.

1733
01:47:04,002 --> 01:47:07,797
In classic WWF style.
Just when you thought he was down.

1734
01:47:09,007 --> 01:47:10,842
Don't count him out.

1735
01:47:11,009 --> 01:47:12,510
An extra reserve.

1736
01:47:18,308 --> 01:47:22,186
It's great that you both have your eyes
to work with in this sequence too.

1737
01:47:22,353 --> 01:47:23,855
Yeah.

1738
01:47:56,429 --> 01:47:57,972
Peter, stop!

1739
01:47:58,139 --> 01:48:00,600
Stop! It's me.

1740
01:48:09,567 --> 01:48:10,985
Mr. Osborn.

1741
01:48:11,194 --> 01:48:12,779
Peter, thank God for you.

1742
01:48:12,987 --> 01:48:15,281
You killed those people
on that balcony.

1743
01:48:15,490 --> 01:48:18,534
The Goblin killed!
I had nothing to do with it!

1744
01:48:18,701 --> 01:48:21,913
Don't let him take me again.
I beg you. Protect me.

1745
01:48:22,163 --> 01:48:23,289
Don't trust him.

1746
01:48:23,456 --> 01:48:26,292
You tried to kill Aunt May.
You tried to kill Mary Jane.

1747
01:48:26,584 --> 01:48:28,086
But not you.

1748
01:48:29,212 --> 01:48:32,965
This is great, because as an audience,
you're going back and forth here.

1749
01:48:33,132 --> 01:48:35,343
Oh, now you know.
He's definitely, you know...

1750
01:48:35,510 --> 01:48:41,683
- Right.
- ...still in the Mr. Hyde persona.

1751
01:48:42,934 --> 01:48:45,645
It's fully taken him.

1752
01:48:46,688 --> 01:48:48,523
Thank God for you.

1753
01:48:49,524 --> 01:48:50,942
Give me your hand.

1754
01:48:52,110 --> 01:48:55,530
Believe in me
as I believed in you.

1755
01:48:56,948 --> 01:48:59,742
I've been like a father to you.

1756
01:49:01,285 --> 01:49:02,954
Be a son to me now.

1757
01:49:03,955 --> 01:49:06,416
Uncle Ben lives.

1758
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:09,877
His name was Ben Parker.

1759
01:49:11,754 --> 01:49:13,214
Godspeed, Spider-Man.

1760
01:49:15,883 --> 01:49:17,969
Thank God for that Spidey-sense.

1761
01:49:31,649 --> 01:49:32,692
Peter...

1762
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:35,611
- That's gonna leave a mark.
- Yeah.

1763
01:49:35,987 --> 01:49:37,280
Don't tell Harry.

1764
01:49:38,156 --> 01:49:42,577
That's a nice moment
before he dies.

1765
01:49:42,744 --> 01:49:45,496
"Don't tell Harry." He does care.

1766
01:49:53,004 --> 01:49:56,090
- Spidey misunderstood once again.
- Right.

1767
01:49:56,257 --> 01:49:59,343
He's trying to do a good deed...

1768
01:49:59,510 --> 01:50:06,100
...hiding the Green Goblin alter ego.

1769
01:50:06,976 --> 01:50:13,691
Harry sees Spider-Man and thinks
he's responsible for his father's death.

1770
01:50:36,255 --> 01:50:37,757
Hey-

1771
01:50:41,135 --> 01:50:43,179
I'm so sorry, Harry.

1772
01:50:44,096 --> 01:50:47,225
I know what it's like
to lose a father.

1773
01:50:50,353 --> 01:50:52,605
Now, was this shot in the fall?

1774
01:50:54,899 --> 01:50:57,902
No. It was...

1775
01:50:58,069 --> 01:51:00,530
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider-Man will pay.

1776
01:51:00,738 --> 01:51:02,740
I'm gonna say it was...

1777
01:51:04,575 --> 01:51:07,662
...early spring in New York.

1778
01:51:09,121 --> 01:51:11,582
You're the only family I have.

1779
01:51:17,922 --> 01:51:19,590
Maybe late winter.

1780
01:51:25,096 --> 01:51:28,683
A little extra guilt for Peter Parker.

1781
01:51:28,850 --> 01:51:33,145
And a little suggestion
of what may be to come...

1782
01:51:33,312 --> 01:51:35,773
...for Harry's character.

1783
01:51:36,107 --> 01:51:38,401
<i>No matter what I</i> do...

1784
01:51:38,568 --> 01:51:41,696
<i>...no matter how hard I try...</i>

1785
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:46,117
<i>...the ones I love will always
be the ones who pay.</i>

1786
01:51:58,045 --> 01:52:00,923
So they're gonna live
happily ever after, right?

1787
01:52:01,090 --> 01:52:03,134
Yes, finally. After...

1788
01:52:03,301 --> 01:52:06,512
Have a big kiss and
they'll walk off hand in hand.

1789
01:52:06,971 --> 01:52:08,931
As any big...

1790
01:52:10,099 --> 01:52:12,560
...superhero Hollywood movie
should be...

1791
01:52:12,727 --> 01:52:15,104
...there should
be a happy ending, right?

1792
01:52:16,355 --> 01:52:20,484
Finally, after all this time.

1793
01:52:20,651 --> 01:52:23,321
All these challenges...

1794
01:52:23,487 --> 01:52:25,281
...tragedy...

1795
01:52:27,575 --> 01:52:29,911
...Peter Parker gets
what he wants most.

1796
01:52:30,828 --> 01:52:32,705
I kept thinking:

1797
01:52:33,664 --> 01:52:37,627
The true caring and love
of Mary Jane Watson.

1798
01:52:37,793 --> 01:52:40,004
Yeah, sorry. Not gonna happen.

1799
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:46,260
For the first time in movie history...

1800
01:52:46,427 --> 01:52:49,180
...I get to say no to a girl.

1801
01:52:52,058 --> 01:52:54,018
...Who makes me feel...

1802
01:52:54,477 --> 01:52:58,189
...like I'm more than I ever
thought I could be.

1803
01:53:00,316 --> 01:53:01,984
That I'm just...

1804
01:53:02,652 --> 01:53:04,153
...me.

1805
01:53:05,237 --> 01:53:07,156
And that's okay.

1806
01:53:09,325 --> 01:53:10,826
The truth is...

1807
01:53:11,869 --> 01:53:16,707
This is a great arc for her character,
that she's really...

1808
01:53:16,874 --> 01:53:21,212
...grown up and settled into herself,
and learned what's important...

1809
01:53:21,379 --> 01:53:23,839
...and set her priorities straight...

1810
01:53:26,801 --> 01:53:29,971
...though she had to
go through a lot to get there.

1811
01:53:33,891 --> 01:53:35,393
Peter is tortured.

1812
01:53:39,563 --> 01:53:43,526
<i>All I wanted was to tell her
how much I loved her.</i>

1813
01:53:43,734 --> 01:53:45,695
Intoxicated.

1814
01:53:48,489 --> 01:53:50,032
You can't what?

1815
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:52,618
Tell you...

1816
01:53:54,328 --> 01:53:58,582
...everything.
I mean, there's so much to tell.

1817
01:53:59,917 --> 01:54:02,211
One of those tough scenes,
there's so much wind...

1818
01:54:02,378 --> 01:54:03,921
...I had to loop the whole thing.

1819
01:54:04,088 --> 01:54:06,340
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1820
01:54:06,966 --> 01:54:09,635
...That I will always be there
for you.

1821
01:54:09,844 --> 01:54:13,806
I will always be there
to take care of you.

1822
01:54:14,807 --> 01:54:16,809
I promise you that.

1823
01:54:20,104 --> 01:54:22,398
I will always be your friend.

1824
01:54:25,317 --> 01:54:27,194
Only a friend...

1825
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:29,613
...Peter Parker?

1826
01:54:31,782 --> 01:54:34,618
That's all I have to give.

1827
01:54:46,464 --> 01:54:48,632
People had really emotional
reactions to this.

1828
01:54:48,799 --> 01:54:51,969
They'd get pissed off like,
"Why? What happened?

1829
01:54:52,136 --> 01:54:55,306
I don't understand.
Why didn't they get together?"

1830
01:54:55,473 --> 01:54:57,767
It's pretty emotionally mature...

1831
01:54:58,893 --> 01:55:02,688
...of Peter there, even though
it might be a little extreme.

1832
01:55:02,855 --> 01:55:05,733
Well, that's as close
as he comes to... You know...

1833
01:55:05,900 --> 01:55:08,194
...it's still very real,
but it's very noble.

1834
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:12,406
- Yeah.
- Very self-sacrificing.

1835
01:55:13,574 --> 01:55:15,910
"It is my curse."

1836
01:55:17,161 --> 01:55:19,080
<i>Who am I?</i>

1837
01:55:19,455 --> 01:55:20,831
<i>I'm Spider-Man.</i>

1838
01:55:21,832 --> 01:55:24,418
Oh, you're Spider-Man?

1839
01:55:24,585 --> 01:55:28,464
And she touched her lips there,
like maybe she...

1840
01:55:28,631 --> 01:55:31,759
- Right. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Maybe she knows something.

1841
01:55:31,926 --> 01:55:35,930
I think we wanted to leave it
ambiguous, like...

1842
01:55:36,097 --> 01:55:38,641
Something was...

1843
01:55:38,808 --> 01:55:41,852
- We're not sure if she knew or not.
- Yeah.

1844
01:55:42,019 --> 01:55:44,563
This is one of the coolest...

1845
01:55:45,689 --> 01:55:49,944
- ...sequences, I think. What a shot.
- Yeah.

1846
01:55:50,861 --> 01:55:55,366
All in all, I'm gonna say
it was pretty cool to play Spider-Man.

1847
01:55:55,533 --> 01:55:58,953
- It was kind of a fun movie.
- It was fun.

1848
01:55:59,120 --> 01:56:01,705
A lot of work, but a lot of fun.

1849
01:56:02,915 --> 01:56:06,836
And seeing it again,
which I haven't in a little while...

1850
01:56:07,002 --> 01:56:10,714
...getting a little nostalgic
and looking forward...

1851
01:56:11,674 --> 01:56:14,093
- ...to revving the engine back up...
- Yeah, yeah.

1852
01:56:14,260 --> 01:56:16,554
...next year. Going back to work.

1853
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:19,306
Back into training and...

1854
01:56:19,890 --> 01:56:22,351
There's Lucy Lawless.
Punk-rock girl, Lucy Lawless.

1855
01:56:22,518 --> 01:56:24,019
Oh, yeah.

1856
01:56:26,188 --> 01:56:28,232
The stunt guys did such a great job.

1857
01:56:28,399 --> 01:56:32,278
I mean, I was literally putting my life
in these guys' hands...

1858
01:56:32,444 --> 01:56:37,366
...because they do all the wire rigging
and I'd be hanging 100 feet in the air.

1859
01:56:37,533 --> 01:56:42,454
And if they screwed up, you know,
I could be seriously injured or die.

1860
01:56:42,621 --> 01:56:48,377
Yeah, it was nice to have confidence
in those guys too.

1861
01:56:48,544 --> 01:56:54,258
Actually, for two days I was strung up
on one of those rigs...

1862
01:56:54,425 --> 01:56:58,762
- ...just in the set there. Yeah, yeah.
- In the office with the Goblin, yeah.

1863
01:57:02,558 --> 01:57:06,353
Well, there you have it.
Are you off back to New York?

1864
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:07,938
I am indeed.

1865
01:57:08,105 --> 01:57:11,984
And maybe J. Jonah Jameson
will get...

1866
01:57:12,151 --> 01:57:15,112
...some New York exterior scenes
in the sequel so I can...

1867
01:57:15,279 --> 01:57:16,947
That'd be nice. We should call Sam.

1868
01:57:17,114 --> 01:57:19,950
...ride my bike to work
instead of flying out to L.A.

1869
01:57:20,117 --> 01:57:24,788
I would like to spend
some more time in Manhattan.

1870
01:57:25,289 --> 01:57:28,209
Yeah, well let's talk
to Laura and Sam.

1871
01:57:28,375 --> 01:57:30,419
- Perfect.
- See what we can figure out.

1872
01:57:30,586 --> 01:57:34,215
You know, now that
we're in a successful franchise...

1873
01:57:34,381 --> 01:57:38,594
...maybe we can yield some
of our weight around and...

1874
01:57:41,263 --> 01:57:47,144
Well, thank you guys for
hearing us talk about our movie.

1875
01:57:47,311 --> 01:57:49,855
Watching ourselves
and rambling on about ourselves.

1876
01:57:50,022 --> 01:57:53,525
Thank you for indulging us
and I hope you enjoyed it.

1877
01:57:53,692 --> 01:57:56,946
And I'm gonna go try to make
another good movie for you.

1878
01:57:57,112 --> 01:58:02,785
Right. Stay tuned for number two.
Signing off.
