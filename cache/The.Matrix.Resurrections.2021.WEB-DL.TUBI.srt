00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,558
You call this a choice?

175
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,193
Oh, honestly, when somebody offered me these things,

176
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,861
I went off on binary conceptions of the world

177
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,396
and said there was no way I was swallowing

178
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,365
some symbolic reduction of my life.

179
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,866
And the woman with the pills laughed

180
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,201
'cause I was missing the point.

181
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,769
What point?

182
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,772
The choice is an illusion.

183
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,108
You already know what you have to do.

184
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,982
Truth.

185
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,623
Okay.

186
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,925
There's an old building

187
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,560
with a skylight and lots of stairs.

188
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:08,894
The Lafayette.

189
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,463
One of the four back doors leads there.

190
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,331
[Morpheus] Oh.

191
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,933
-Don't fight it. -Whoa, what's happening?

192
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,167
Keep breathing.

193
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,669
Extraction works pretty much the same

194
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,804
for humans and programs.

195
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:22,475
Ouch.

196
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,776
Ah.

197
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,345
Okay.

198
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,249
-Hey. -Hey.

199
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,118
I've never worn different glasses before.

200
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,987
Yeah, looks good. Which door?

201
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,989
-It's gotta be... -Okay.

202
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,629
Agent White.

203
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:44,830
Agent Smith?

204
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,298
[laughs]

209
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,281
Bugs! I thought I lost you.

210
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,682
Can you get us to the window pane?

211
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,851
Bugs! Bugs! He's an agent!

[Morpheus exclaims, grunts]

213
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,197
That window! Go hard!

[suspenseful music playing]

221
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,205
Something wrong?

222
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,075
Uh... Just a little crash.

223
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,477
Morning, Bobbi. Morning, dude.

224
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:42,348
What a beautiful day to be alive. Am I right?

225
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,516
-Problemo? -He lost something.

226
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,219
Is this old Matrix code?

227
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,623
A little Modal experiment.

228
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,826
-For Binary? -[cell phone chimes]

[man] I'm not trying to blow smoke up your ass,

232
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:07,039
but the first time I played the trilogy, I was shook.

233
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,675
The paradox between free will and destiny.

234
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,910
Are we all just algorithms

235
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,144
doing what we're supposed to do

236
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,846
or can we escape our programming?

237
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:18,017
Genius, inside the context of the game, BT dubs.

238
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,185
Hey, did I tell you it took over my life?

239
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,988
Yeah. I failed the seventh grade. [chuckles]

240
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,190
Your game almost ruined me.

241
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,693
-So you've said. -Yet here we are.

242

-[cups clink] -You tell me, Mr. Anderson,

243
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:31,997
is it free will

00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,700
or destiny?

245
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,407
Oh, yeah.

246
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,409
There she is.

Total f-ing MILF.

Daggers. Look, I'm sorry.

249
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,182
I'm a geek. I was raised by machines.

250
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,517
Maybe you should go.

251
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,720
No, please. I... I promise, best self.

252
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,155
Best self.

253
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,293
Sure.

254
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,529
You ever talk to her?

255
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:06,966
Tell you what.

256
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:11,570
For all you've done for me, let me do this for you.

Hi. Um...

260
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,211
I know this is all a bit extemporaneous.

261
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,113
I'm Jude Gallagher.

262
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,749
I work for a game company called Deus Machina.

263
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,117
Hi, Jude, I'm Tiffany.

264
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:28,087
Tiffany. Wow. Didn't see that coming.

-Mom loved Audrey Hepburn. -Jude.

266

Oh, and this is my very good friend, Thomas Anderson.

He is a bona fide famous person

268
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,496
and considered by most to be

269
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,665
the greatest game designer of our generation.

270
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:40,933
I'm sorry about this.

Uh, we both come here.

-Can I have your morning bun? -[boy] Hey!

Are you trying to ball my mom or what?

Babe! What's going on? We're gonna be late.

281
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,162
This is my husband, Chad.

-Nice to meet you. -Hey.

283

Babe, we gotta get Callie to practice.

00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,936
Right. Sorry. [chuckles]

285

You wrote that one, yeah?

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,663

I mean, O-M-G.

It's so perfect, it's gotta be fake.

00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,674
Yeah.

Sure.

00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,611
Have a seat.

00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,251
I thought you quit.

305
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,387
I quit calling it a habit.

306
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,456
Now it's just a guilty pleasure.

307
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:50,162
Oh. Maybe I can make this easy for you.

308
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,164
I know Binary is over budget.

309
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,733
This is not about Binary, Tom. It's bigger than that.

310
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,968
This is about our future,

311
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:59,071
which is a sticky subject, given our past.

312
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,472
What do you mean?

313
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,041
How's the therapy?

314
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,543
Good.

No.

318
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,353
That's terrific.

319
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:19,458
Look, Tom, I know we've always had our differences.

320
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,393
What did you say about our first meeting?

321
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,763
We had all the chemistry of an FBI interrogation.

00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,834
But look at this place.

325
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,370
We did this.

326
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,839
Together.

327
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,708
Yeah.

328
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,677
Now what?

329
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:42,447
Things have changed. The market's tough.

330
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,683
I'm sure you can understand why our beloved

parent company, Warner Bros.,

332
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,754
has decided to make a sequel to the trilogy.

What?

334
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,291
They informed me they're gonna do it with or without us.

335
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,092
I thought they couldn't do that.

336
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,227
[exhales]

337
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,828
Oh, they can.

338
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,063
And they made it clear

339
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,299
they'll kill our contract if we don't cooperate.

340
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,267
Really?

341
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:06,238
I know you said the story was over for you,

342
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,507
but that's the thing about stories.

343
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,077
They never really end, do they?

344
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,746
We're still telling the same stories we've always told,

345
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:19,284
just with different names, different faces

346
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,855
and I have to say I'm kind of excited.

347
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:27,793
After all these years,

348
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,996
to be going back to where it all started.

349
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,465
Back to The Matrix.

350
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,268
I've spoken to Marketing...

353
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,310
Yeah.

354
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,378
Are you all right?

355
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,946
[exhales nervously]

356
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:49,915
Yeah.

357
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,022
[analyst] What were you feeling at that point?

358
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:01,927
What was I feeling?

359
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:09,968
I felt either I'm having a mental breakdown again

360
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:14,306
or I'm living inside a computer-generated reality

361
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,941
that has imprisoned me...

362
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:17,776
again.

363
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,745
[laughs]

00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:22,848
[chuckles softly]

365
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,921
Not much of a choice.

366
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,290
No.

367
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:32,891
Maybe it's not as binary as that.

368
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,395
Maybe there are other ways to understand what happened.

369
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:37,863
Yeah.

370
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,265
Thomas, you are a suicide survivor

371
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:43,168
gifted with a powerful imagination.

372
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,903
Those facts have combined

373
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,572
to create dangerous fictions in your life.

374
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,241
Yesterday, you walked into a meeting

375
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,375
with your business partner

376
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:51,943
and he ambushed you,

377
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,513
demanding you make a game you said you would never make.

378
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,849
This attack effectively took away your voice.

379
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,686
His violence triggered you and your mind fought back.

380
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,721
You did to him what he was doing to you.

381
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,557
We've talked about the value

382
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:09,127
of adaptive anger in healing trauma.

383
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:12,564
Far from suggesting a repeat of your initial breakdown,

384
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:13,865
I believe this episode

385
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,834
demonstrates healthy self-protection.

386
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,604
And more importantly, I remember how hard

387
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,674
it was for you to share something like this.

388
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,577
Which tells me just how far we've come.

389
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:28,480
[chuckles softly]

390
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,884
Do you need a refill on your prescription?

[sighs]

392
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:35,921
Yeah.

First of all, I know I speak for everyone

397
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,048
when I say that I'm so, so excited

398
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,283
to be working on a game that was such a...

399
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,452
well, game changer.

400
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,187
Now, the packet in front of you

401
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,923
has our focus group research.

402

Inside, you'll find the breakdown

403
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:16,495
including keyword association with the brand.

404
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,664
The top two being "originality" and "fresh,"

405
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,733
which I think are great things to keep in mind

406
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,035
as you begin working on Matrix 4.

407
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,139

And, frankly, I've got zero tolerance

for anything that requires a syllabus and a highlighter.

425

[Tiffany] I remember wanting a family,

464
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,088
but was that because

465
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:05,924
that's what women are supposed to want?

466
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:07,792
How do you know if you want something yourself

467
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:10,962
or if your upbringing programmed you to want it?

468

Mmm.

469
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,933
I pay my analyst a lot of money

No. Never had kids.

Sure.

00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,389
"Don't you think she looks like me?"

512
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,026
You know what he did?

513
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,496
He laughed.

514
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,036
And I laughed too, like it was a joke.

515
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,872
How could it not be, right?

516
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:37,542
Made me so angry.

517
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:41,412
I hated myself for laughing.

518
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:46,217
I wanted to kick him so hard.

519
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:48,653
Not too hard.

520
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,956
Maybe just hard enough to break his jaw off.

521
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:53,324
[chuckles]

522
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,028
And right now, you're probably regretting

523
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,830
sitting down with me.

524
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:04,702
This is the best thing I've done in a long time.

Hi, this is Tiff.

529
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:16,681
Oh, God, no.

[gasps]

531
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,819
I'll be right there.

00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,621
My, uh, youngest stuck a Lego up his nose.

533
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:25,957
Oh.

534
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,326
I gotta go.

535
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:33,164
I hope I see you again.

[alarm blaring]

537
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:52,083
[announcer on speaker] There has been a report

538
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,618
of an emergency.

539
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,854
Proceed calmly to the nearest exit

540
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,822
and leave the building immediately.

541
00:30:57,889 --> 00:30:59,324
What's going on?

542
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,226
We probably just got swatted by some 14-year-old.

543
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,894
Yeah, someone pissed about the latest update.

544
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,429
Or they're just a dick.

545
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:07,165
Please move to the exits. Building's being evacuated.

[security guard] Sir, this way.

00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:37,262
Jude?

550
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:39,931
Jude!

00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:48,273
At last.

552
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:51,276
[chuckles] Ah.

553
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:52,911
I wasn't too sure about the callback,

554
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:54,846
but, you know, it was hard to resist.

555

What?

556
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,515
Morpheus Uno. Reveal at the window.

557
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,251
Lightning, thunder and theater.

558
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,153
At last.

559
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,555
All these years later, here's me,

560
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,925
strolling out of a toilet stall.

561
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,092
Tragedy or farce?

562
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,961
I know you.

563
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,930
Not every day you meet your maker.

564
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,164
This can't be happening.

565
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,033
Oh, most definitely is.

566
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,568
You can't be a character I coded.

How?

All the explanation you need.

00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:35,453
Oh.

00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,688
No.

No, no, no.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you mean, "no"?

575
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:43,161
You wanted this, you did this. This was your idea.

576
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:47,532
[hesitating] It was a test. An experiment.

577

An experiment?

You put me in a tiny-ass Modal,

580

I nearly lost my shit searching for you

I know, I know. He's having a moment.

You must have walked.

You feel like you can talk about it?

When we started working together,

632
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,513
you had lost your capacity

to discern reality from fiction.

You came to me after trying to jump off a building.

but you seem particularly triggered right now.

Can you tell me how it started?

641
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,645
He texted me.

Morpheus.

Ah.

645
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,954
So, he's back.

646
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,289
It wasn't actually him.

647
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:09,560
It was a program I coded for a Modal.

648
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:11,929
And this "Modal," Morpheus,

649
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:13,898
came to help you escape

650
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:17,702
from a virtual reality called The Matrix.

651
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,680
Am I crazy?

652
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,283
We don't use that word in here.

653
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,386
What word should I use?

654
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:38,823
What word explains what is happening to me?

655
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,558
Can I see the texts?

They were erased.

658

If we got in my car and drove to your office,

659
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:55,072
what do you think we'd find there?

660
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:56,374
Nothing.

661
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,012
Because there was no attack.

662
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,848
No one was killed.

663
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:06,951
No one texted.

664
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,986
My mind made it all up.

665
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,124
Is that what I'm supposed to say?

666
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,725
Is that what you believe?

667
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,261
It felt real.

668
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,096
Of course.

669
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:22,099
It was your great ambition to make a game

670
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:24,568
that was indistinguishable from reality.

671
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,103
To achieve this goal,

672
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,773
you converted elements of your life into narrative.

673
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:31,108
Your sublimated anger toward your business partner

674
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:33,344
cast him as your nemesis.

675
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:35,012
A married woman named Tiffany

676
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:38,582
became the "Trinity" of a doomed romance.

677
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:42,720
Even your dislike of my cat made it into your Matrix.

678
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,555
There's nothing wrong with that.

679
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:46,257
It's what artists do.

680
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,560

01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:27,750
and turned it into something trivial.

1022
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:31,220
That's what the Matrix does.

1023
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:34,257
It weaponizes every idea.

1024
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:36,392
Every dream.

1025
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:39,829
Everything that's important to us.

1026
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,534
Where better to bury truth than inside something

1027
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:47,637
as ordinary as a video game?

1028
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,639
That sounds like the Oracle.

1029

[Bugs chuckles]

1030
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:52,975
Heard so much about her.

1031
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,246
She was gone before I was free.

1032

Gone?

1033
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:03,219
When this new version of the Matrix was uploaded,

1034
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:06,255
there was a purge.

1035

They promised peace and they gave us purge.

No.

1038
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,535
No, there was peace.

1039

You made it possible, and it changed everything.

1040
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:29,779
Doesn't feel like it changed anything.

1041
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:32,982
The Matrix is the same or worse.

1042
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:35,318
And I'm back where I started.

1043
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:40,490
It feels like everything I did,

1044
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:43,126
everything we did...

1045
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:48,197
[both grunt]

1046
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:51,300
...like none of it mattered.

1047
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:55,204
All of it mattered.

1048
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:58,407
I can show you.

1049
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:10,820
This is my crew.

1050

Our operator, Seq.

1051
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:21,964
Sequoia. But everybody calls me Seq.

1052
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:23,566
Nice to meet you.

1053
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:26,702
Dad loved redwoods.

1054
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:28,037
When he escaped the Matrix

1055
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:29,672
and found out they no longer existed,

1056
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:31,307
it almost killed him.

1057
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:32,508
Lucky, he met Mom

1058
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:35,011
and here I am.

1059
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:38,948
This is Lexy, Berg and Ellster.

1060
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:40,783
Hi.

1061
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:43,286
You knew my grandfather, Captain Roland.

1062
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:46,022
Roland was your grandfather?

1063
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:47,857
He always laughed,

1064
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:48,958
joking how he never believed in you.

1065
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:51,327
But, in private, he said that

1066
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:53,663
you freed his mind a second time.

1067
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:55,798
Uh, not to fanboy out here,

1068
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:57,867
but this is kind of a huge moment for me.

1069
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:00,403
Berg is our resident Neo-ologist.

1070
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:01,571
A what?

1071
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:04,874
There's a lot of people out there like me

1072
01:04:04,941 --> 01:04:07,176
who are a little bit obsessed with your life.

1073
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:08,411
I would never have recognized

1074
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:09,745
your Modal if it weren't for him.

1075
01:04:09,812 --> 01:04:11,047
Whenever you're feeling up for it,

1076
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:13,049
I've got, like, a million questions.

1077
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:15,585
Me too. Starting with them.

1078
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:18,087
[Bugs] It's okay.

1079
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:19,922
Come meet him.

1080
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:21,424
This is Cybebe.

1081
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:22,892
That's Octacles.

1082

-That's Lumin8. -[chittering]

Machines are on our side now?

1084
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:29,265
They are synthients.

1085
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:31,033
It's a word they prefer to "Machines."

1086
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:32,368
Your contact with the Synthient City

1087
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:34,871
had a huge impact on their world.

1088
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:35,972
[Bugs] That's what I meant.

1089
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:37,373
What you changed

1090
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,175
that nobody believed could ever be changed.

1091
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:43,579
The meaning of "our side."

[Cybebe warbling softly]

1093
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:49,085
Cybebe and Octacles risked their lives

1094
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,419
to help get you out.

1095
01:04:51,787 --> 01:04:52,989
Thank you.

1096
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:55,358
But why?

1097
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:58,060
[Morpheus] Not all seek to control.

1098
01:04:58,127 --> 01:05:00,229
Just as not all wish to be free.

What is that?

1100
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:05,501
An exomorphic-particle codex. It's pretty new.

1101
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,770
It gives programs access to this world.

1102
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:09,105
Within limits.

1103
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:12,241
Limits are the domain of the limited.

I can download the codex manual for you.

Yes. We've analyzed the data.

It could be Trinity.

Look, you were not a typical flush-and-grab.

You were in this weird tower that Cybebe

had never accessed, and she's now exiled.

Transfer your access codes.

1188
01:09:12,348 --> 01:09:13,883
You are done, Captain.

1189
01:09:13,949 --> 01:09:14,950
[gasps softly]

1190
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:25,461
We need to talk.

1191
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:33,269
[Niobe] When word first came

1192
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:35,638
that it actually might be you...

1193
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:43,279
I didn't know how I would feel in this moment.

1194
01:09:51,053 --> 01:09:52,888
It is nice to see you.

1195
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:55,791
-It's good to see you too. -[glasses clink]

1196
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:04,366
A long way from Dozer's paint stripper.

1197
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:07,403
[chuckles] Yes.

1198
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:09,405
A lot has changed.

1199
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:12,775
Except maybe you.

1200
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:17,246
You remember this?

1201
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:27,022
It's so easy to forget how much noise

1202
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:28,958
the Matrix pumps into your head

1203
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:30,859
until you unplug.

1204
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:32,127
[Neo sighs]

1205
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:33,662
Yeah.

1206
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:36,599
Something else makes the same kind of noise.

1207
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:39,001
Takes over every damn thing,

1208
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:40,769
just like the Matrix.

1209
01:10:42,304 --> 01:10:43,505
War.

1210
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:47,776
I stood at the barricade of the Temple.

1211
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:51,847
Staring at the army of Sentinels,

1212
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:55,651
waiting for them to kill every one of us.

1213
01:10:57,086 --> 01:11:00,289
But then, they left.

1214
01:11:01,323 --> 01:11:03,859
They said you saved us.

1215
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:04,960
I didn't believe it.

1216
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:08,564
Every night I would dream of attack sirens.

1217
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:10,499
But then,

1218
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:15,337
I would wake up to this...

1219
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:20,709
silence.

1220
01:11:24,146 --> 01:11:25,681
I'm ashamed of it now.

1221
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:29,718
My pessimism of how long it took me to believe

1222
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:33,055
a world without war was possible.

1223
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:36,458
You gave me that.

1224
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:39,528
You gave that gift to us all.

1225
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:43,365
And it is the gift that continues to bear fruit.

1226
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:47,603
Come help me get up.

1227
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:49,471
Let's take a walk.

1228
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:52,841
[mysterious music playing]

1229
01:12:02,451 --> 01:12:04,019
[elevator door opens]

1230
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:15,698
Oh! Beautiful.

1231
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:19,702
This is Freya, head of botany.

1232
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:22,971
And this is Quillion, our lead digitologist.

1233
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:27,042
I presume our guest needs no introduction.

1234
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:29,945
Nothing travels faster than light,

1235
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,213
except gossip.

1236
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,481
[Freya chuckles]

1237
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:35,017
Welcome to the Garden, Neo.

1238
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:38,320
A strawberry?

1239
01:12:38,387 --> 01:12:39,955
Using digital code from the Matrix,

1240
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:42,458
we retro-convert it into DNA sequences.

1241
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:43,959
And they grow here?

1242
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:45,694
It's not easy augmenting the genome

1243
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:48,430
to photosynthesize Bio-sky, but...

1244
01:12:48,497 --> 01:12:50,165
-We're getting there. -[chuckles]

1245
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:52,735
Go ahead. Try it.

1246
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:00,008
[Niobe chuckles]

1247
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:02,444
We're quite excited about the blueberries.

1248
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:04,413
You remember that shit we used to eat?

1249
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,882
That slop that tasted like rust.

1250
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:12,054
Zion could have never made something like this.

1251
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:13,689
Why?

1252
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:16,392
Because we needed synthients

1253
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:18,560
and DI like him.

1254
01:13:18,627 --> 01:13:21,864
Zion was stuck in the past. Stuck in war.

1255
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:24,500
Stuck in a Matrix of its own.

1256
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:28,370
They believed that it had to be us or them.

1257
01:13:28,437 --> 01:13:31,373
This city was built by us

1258
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,175
and them.

1259
01:13:38,781 --> 01:13:40,516
What happened to Zion?

1260
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:43,952
I've been waiting for you to ask that question.

1261
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:49,258
All of the troubles started in the Machine Cities.

1262
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:53,095
Power plants were unable to produce enough energy.

1263
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:56,999
Nothing can breed violence like scarcity.

1264
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:00,202
For the first time,

1265
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:03,705
we saw machines at war with one other.

1266
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:10,712
We got word from the Oracle of a new power rising.

1267
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:15,217
That was the last we heard from her.

1268
01:14:18,987 --> 01:14:20,222
Morpheus.

1269
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:24,693
[Niobe] After the siege, he was elected unanimously.

1270
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,696
High Chair of the Council.

1271
01:14:27,763 --> 01:14:31,133
Oh, how he loved that. [scoffs]

1272
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:35,471
But as rumors of this new power spread,

1273
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:37,005
he ignored them.

1274
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:41,810
He was certain what you had done could not be undone.

1275
01:14:41,877 --> 01:14:45,681
All of these people never stopped believing in miracles,

1276
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:48,217
believing in you.

1277
01:15:00,295 --> 01:15:01,763
I'm sorry.

1278
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:05,934
How could I know this would happen?

1279
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:08,337
We didn't understand all of it back then.

1280
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:10,172
No more than we do now.

1281
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:13,709
I didn't come here to cause you problems, Niobe,

1282
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:16,545
but I need your help.

1283
01:15:18,113 --> 01:15:19,548
Trinity is alive.

1284
01:15:19,615 --> 01:15:21,383
Then there is another question.

1285
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:23,252
Why did they keep her alive?

1286
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:24,620
I can't answer that.

1287
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:28,056
But if there's a chance I can free her,

1288
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:29,725
I have to try.

1289
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:33,729
Even if it means endangering everyone in this city?

1290
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:39,668
I'm sorry, Neo.

1291
01:15:39,735 --> 01:15:43,305
I won't let what happened to Zion happen to Io.

1292
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:46,575
I hope you'll forgive an old woman

1293
01:15:46,642 --> 01:15:49,711
for asking you to go with Sheperd, here,

1294
01:15:49,778 --> 01:15:51,280
till we have better understanding

1295
01:15:51,346 --> 01:15:52,814
of what's going on.

1296
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:55,817
You're going to imprison me after I just got free?

1297
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:59,721
I know it doesn't seem fair,

1298
01:15:59,788 --> 01:16:02,691
but neither does growing old.

1299
01:16:02,758 --> 01:16:04,927
But you don't hear me complaining.

1300

[elevator whirring]

1301
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:18,707
Sorry.

I've never met a legend before.

There's that word again.

[Sheperd] People talk a lot about the old days.

1310
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:47,836
About you, the viral Agent.

1311
01:16:47,903 --> 01:16:50,706
The siege of Zion.

1312
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:52,841
Everything was simpler back then.

1313
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:55,310
People wanted to be free.

1314
01:16:57,412 --> 01:16:59,247
It's different now.

1315

Sometimes it feels like people gave up.

1316
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:05,754

What happened to Bugs and the others?

waiting for you to make the choice

to remain meekly incarcerated

or bust the hell out of here and go and find Trinity.

[Sheperd] General, what should we do?

01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:41,483
[Freya] Bugs has the same independence of mind

This is not independence of mind.

You knew that he and Trinity both were alive...

and you didn't tell me?

1741

There were times I doubted my decision, Niobe.

1742

But Io needed you.

1743

Why are you here now?

1752
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:42,422
Neo's escape has destabilized the Matrix.

1753
01:42:42,489 --> 01:42:43,857
The Anomaleum draws its current

1754
01:42:43,924 --> 01:42:45,259
from Trinity alone now.

1755
01:42:45,325 --> 01:42:47,461
A fail-safe has been triggered to reset

1756
01:42:47,528 --> 01:42:49,496
the Matrix back to the previous version.

1757
01:42:49,563 --> 01:42:51,398
But The Analyst halted the reset.

1758
01:42:51,465 --> 01:42:52,733
He's convinced the authorities

1759
01:42:52,799 --> 01:42:54,835
that you will soon return voluntarily.

1760
01:42:56,036 --> 01:42:57,871
And why would he say that?

1761
01:42:57,938 --> 01:43:01,208
Because if I don't go back, he'll kill Trinity.

What would you choose, Neo?

1765
01:43:11,418 --> 01:43:12,819
I'll go back.

1766
01:43:14,521 --> 01:43:16,723
Well, The Analyst knows you well,

1767
01:43:16,790 --> 01:43:19,459
but that knowledge has made him incautious.

1768
01:43:19,526 --> 01:43:21,261
After you escaped,

1769
01:43:21,328 --> 01:43:24,198
he should have accepted his losses and devacuated Trinity.

1770
01:43:24,264 --> 01:43:27,201
But that would have prevented this extraordinary opportunity

1771

When my father realized

how the Anomaleum was going to be used,

1851
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:37,577
he covertly transferred the designs to me.

1852
01:48:37,644 --> 01:48:40,180
The Analyst discovered his betrayal

1853

I thought you should know that I'm here because of her.

All I ever wanted was to be as fearless as Trinity.

1862
01:49:22,222 --> 01:49:25,692
But I saw how she reacted in the garage, and I...

You're wondering if I'm wrong.

What if we're too late?

But she did.

She believed in me.

All I want is to talk to her.

Do you mean Tiff?

1882
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:23,476
Come back, and you can talk to her as often as you like.

1883
01:51:23,543 --> 01:51:24,911
I mean, handsome Chad

may have something to say about it.

1885
01:51:26,446 --> 01:51:29,916

Really?

1888

But if she wants me,

1889
01:51:36,189 --> 01:51:38,158
then you'll let us go free.

1890
01:51:38,224 --> 01:51:40,894
And why would I do something as stupid as that?

1891
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:43,897
Right now, I'm on a ship full of people who will unplug me

1892
01:51:43,963 --> 01:51:46,900
before they'll let you take me back.

this is your only chance.

But how do I know they won't unplug you anyway?

We wait.

Doesn't it seem crazy to come all this way

1908

and leave her here?

1909
01:52:56,903 --> 01:52:59,606
We must abide by her decision.

1910

And if she says no,

what happens to Neo?

1912

At this time,

1913

the most important choice of Neo's life

1914

is not his to make.

01:54:16,182 --> 01:54:19,485
why does this story feel like a memory?

1927
01:54:26,693 --> 01:54:28,428
There's a part of me

that feels like I have been waiting my whole life for you.

Maybe I was afraid of this.

Games are dead.

2182
02:27:28,439 --> 02:27:30,141
Narrative? Dead.

2183
02:27:30,208 --> 02:27:32,109
Media is nothing but neuro-trigger response

2184
02:27:32,176 --> 02:27:33,411
and viral conditioning.

2185
02:27:33,477 --> 02:27:35,146
Wait, what are you two talking about?

2186
02:27:37,381 --> 02:27:39,150
Cat videos.

2187
02:27:39,217 --> 02:27:42,954
What we need is a series of videos

2188
02:27:43,020 --> 02:27:45,423
that we call "The Catrix."
