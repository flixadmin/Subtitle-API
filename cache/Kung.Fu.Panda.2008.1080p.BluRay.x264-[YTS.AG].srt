- He's too awesome!

- And attractive.
- How can we repay you?

15
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:33,301
There is no charge for awesomeness.

16
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:36,012
Or attractiveness.

17
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,346

You'll be late for work!

31
00:02:28,397 --> 00:02:29,649
What?

32
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,074
Po! Get up!

33
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:57,301
Po! What are you doing up there?

34
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,636
Nothing.

35
00:03:02,264 --> 00:03:05,976
Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper! Tigress!

36
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:15,695
Po! Let's go! You're late for work.

37
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,154
Coming!

38
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:28,708
Sorry, Dad.

39
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,585
Sorry doesn't make the noodles.

40
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,046
What were you doing up there?
All that noise.

41
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,590
Nothing. I just had a crazy dream.

42
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:37,883
About what?

43
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,552
What were you dreaming about?

44
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:41,178
What was I...

45
00:03:42,012 --> 00:03:44,014
I was dreaming about

46
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:47,059
noodles.

47
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:51,188
Noodles? You were really
dreaming about noodles?

48
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,816
Yeah. What else
would I be dreaming about?

49
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:56,360
Careful! That soup is sharp.

50
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,903
Oh, happy day!

51
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:01,866
My son, finally having the noodle dream!

52
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:07,329
You don't know how long I've been
waiting for this moment.

53
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,248
This is a sign, Po.

54
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:11,125
A sign of what?

55
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:15,838
You are almost ready to be entrusted
with the secret ingredient

56
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:18,174
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

57
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:23,387
Then you will fulfill your destiny
and take over the restaurant!

58
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,932
As I took it over from my father,
who took it over from his father

59
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,435
who won it from a friend
in a game of mahjong.

60
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:32,229
Dad, Dad, Dad, it was just a dream.

61
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,607
No, it was the dream.

62
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,235
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs through our veins.

63
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,198
But, Dad, didn't you ever want to do
something else?

64
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:44,116
Something besides noodles?

65
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,119
Actually, when I was young and crazy,

66
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:51,290
I thought about running away
and learning how to make tofu.

67
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:52,458
Why didn't you?

68
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,335
Because it was a stupid dream.

69
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:58,547
Can you imagine me making tofu?

70
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,008
Tofu.

71
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:04,553
No! We all have our place in this world.

72
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,181
Mine is here, and yours is...

73
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:08,474
I know, is here.

74
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:11,685
No, it's at tables 2, 5, 7, and 12.

75
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,854
Service with a smile.

76
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:47,429
Well done, students,
if you were trying to disappoint me.

77
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,683
Tigress, you need more ferocity!
Monkey, greater speed.

78
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:53,644
Crane, height. Viper, subtlety. Mantis...

79
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:55,521
- Master Shifu.
- What?

80
00:05:55,604 --> 00:05:58,065
It's Master Oogway.
He wants to see you.

81
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:12,454
Master Oogway, you summoned me?
Is something wrong?

82
00:06:18,794 --> 00:06:23,215
Why must something be wrong
for me to want to see my old friend?

83
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,426
So, nothing's wrong?

84
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:28,137
Well, I didn't say that.

85
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:47,865
You were saying?

86
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,035
I have had a vision.

87
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:53,829
Tai Lung will return.

88
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:01,337
That is impossible! He is in prison.

89
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,256
Nothing is impossible.

90
00:07:05,132 --> 00:07:06,132
Zeng!

91
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,510
Fly to Chorh-Gom Prison and tell them

92
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,931
to double the guards, double
their weapons, double everything!

93
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,891
Tai Lung does not leave that prison!

94
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:15,434
Yes, Master Shifu!

95
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:22,274
One often meets his destiny
on the road he takes to avoid it.

96
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,400
We have to do something!

97
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,487
We can't let him march on the valley
and take his revenge!

98
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,571
He'll...

99
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,949
Your mind is like this water, my friend.

100
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:33,452
When it is agitated,
it becomes difficult to see.

101
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,622
But if you allow it to settle,

102
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,708
the answer becomes clear.

103
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,713
The Dragon Scroll.

104
00:07:45,547 --> 00:07:47,132
It is time.

105
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:51,929
But who? Who is worthy to be trusted
with the secret to limitless power?

106
00:07:52,012 --> 00:07:56,725
To become the Dragon Warrior?

107
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,268
I don't know.

108
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,064
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

109
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:04,024
Watch it, Po!

110
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,609
Sorry. Suck it up!

111
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,780
Sorry. A thousand pardons.

112
00:08:09,863 --> 00:08:10,864
What?

113
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,203
Master Oogway's choosing
the Dragon Warrior! Today!

114
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:18,455
Everyone! Go! Get to the Jade Palace!

115
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,874
One of the Five
is gonna get the Dragon Scroll!

116
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,644
We've been waiting a thousand years
for this!

117
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,003
Take the bowl!

118
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,422
This is the greatest day
in kung fu history!

119
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:28,215
Don't worry about it. Just go!

120
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:30,300
Po! Where are you going?

121
00:08:31,218 --> 00:08:33,512
To the Jade Palace.

122
00:08:33,595 --> 00:08:35,889
You're forgetting your noodle cart.

123
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:40,519
The whole valley will be there,
and you'll sell noodles to all of them.

124
00:08:40,602 --> 00:08:42,021
Selling noodles?

125
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,942
But, Dad, I was thinking, maybe I...

126
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,153
- Yeah?
- I was thinking maybe I...

127
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,536
could also sell the bean buns.
They're about to go bad.

128
00:08:57,619 --> 00:08:59,329
That's my boy!

129
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,623
I told you that dream was a sign.

130
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,752
Yeah. Glad I had it.

131
00:09:08,964 --> 00:09:11,341
- I'm a kung fu warrior!
- Me, too!

132
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,969
- There's spots at the top.
- Let's go.

133
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,215
Come on. Come on!

134
00:09:51,298 --> 00:09:53,133
Almost there.

135
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,384
What?

136
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:57,137
No! Oh, no!

137
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:03,018
- Sorry, Po.
- We'll bring you back a souvenir.

138
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:10,984
No. I'll bring me back a souvenir.

139
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,574
It is an historic day.

140
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,409
Isn't it, Master Oogway?

141
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:24,331
Yes, and one I feared
I would not live to see.

142
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:26,416
Are your students ready?

143
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,252
Yes, Master Oogway.

144
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:31,130
Know this, old friend.

145
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:35,551
Whomever I choose will not only bring
peace to the valley

146
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:38,262
but also to you.

147
00:10:42,015 --> 00:10:45,727
Let the tournament begin!

148
00:10:57,197 --> 00:10:58,574
Yeah.

149
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:02,327
No, no, wait!

150
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,746
I'm coming! Wait, wait!

151
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,081
Yes!

152
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:11,253
Hey! Open the door!

153
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,425
Let me in!

154
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:19,052
Citizens of the Valley of Peace,

155
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,639
it is my great honor
to present to you, Tigress!

156
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:26,935
Viper! Crane! Monkey! Mantis!

157
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,604
The Furious Five!

158
00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:42,576
Yeah, the Furious Five!

159
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,205
Warriors, prepare!

160
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,832
Wait. No. Oh, peeky-hole.

161
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,250
- Ready for battle!
- Yeah.

162
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,296
The Thousand Tongues of Fire.

163
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:57,716
Look at that.

164
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,801
Hey! Get out of the way!

165
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:36,421
And finally, Master Tigress!

166
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,261
Believe me, citizens,
you have not seen anything yet.

167
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,595
I know!

168
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,767
Master Tigress! Face Iron Ox
and his Blades of Death.

169
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:05,701
I sense the Dragon Warrior
is among us.

170
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,834
Citizens of the Valley of Peace,

171
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:18,463
Master Oogway will now choose
the Dragon Warrior!

172
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,591
Oh, no! No, no, wait!

173
00:13:22,884 --> 00:13:24,386
Yeah.

174
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:41,903
Po!

175
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,905
What are you doing?

176
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,533
What does it look like I'm doing? Stop!

177
00:13:46,616 --> 00:13:48,577
I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior!

178
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:56,001
But I don't understand.
You finally had the noodle dream!

179
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,921
I lied. I don't dream about noodles, Dad.

180
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:06,303
I love kung fu!

181
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,320
Come on, son. Let's get back to work.

182
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:27,324
Okay.

183
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:35,165
Come back!

184
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,191
What's going on?

185
00:15:01,983 --> 00:15:03,693
Where...

186
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:07,614
What are you pointing...

187
00:15:10,325 --> 00:15:12,327
Okay. Sorry.

188
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,871
I just wanted to see
who the Dragon Warrior was.

189
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,873
How interesting.

190
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:20,252
Master, are you pointing at me?

191
00:15:20,335 --> 00:15:22,337
- Him.
- Who?

192
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,550
- You.
- Me?

193
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:32,139
The universe has brought us
the Dragon Warrior!

194
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:33,765
- What?
- What?

195
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,559
- What?
- What?

196
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,029
Stop, wait! Who told you to...

197
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,040
Master Oogway, wait.

198
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:03,420
That flabby panda can't possibly be
the answer to our problem.

199
00:16:03,503 --> 00:16:07,215
You were about to point at Tigress
and that thing fell in front of her!

200
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,717
That was just an accident!

201
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,553
There are no accidents.

202
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:29,446
Forgive us, Master. We have failed you.

203
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:32,824
No. If the panda has not quit
by morning,

204
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,243
then I will have failed you.

205
00:16:53,553 --> 00:16:56,264
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
I bring a message

206
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,600
from Master Shifu.

207
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,397
What?

208
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,815
"Double the guard"?

209
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,692
"Extra precautions"?

210
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,111
"Your prison may not be adequate"?

211
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,660
You doubt my prison security?

212
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:18,578
Absolutely not.

213
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,790
Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.

214
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:25,502
I'll give you a message
for your Master Shifu.

215
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:29,297
Escape from Chorh-Gom Prison
is impossible!

216
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,179
Impressive, isn't it?

217
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,224
It's very impressive.

218
00:17:39,307 --> 00:17:40,767
It's very impressive.

219
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,520
One way in, one way out.

220
00:17:43,603 --> 00:17:47,691
One thousand guards and one prisoner.

221
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:50,277
Yes, except that prisoner

222
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,070
is Tai Lung.

223
00:17:56,157 --> 00:17:57,867
Take us down.

224
00:18:03,456 --> 00:18:04,833
What are you doing?

225
00:18:16,177 --> 00:18:17,637
Oh, my.

226
00:18:21,891 --> 00:18:24,978
Behold Tai Lung.

227
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:29,691
I'm just gonna wait right here.

228
00:18:29,774 --> 00:18:34,070
It's nothing to worry about.
It's perfectly safe.

229
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,406
Crossbows! At the ready!

230
00:18:36,489 --> 00:18:38,283
Crossbows?

231
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:40,910
Hey, tough guy, did you hear?

232
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:45,457
Oogway's giving someone the Dragon
Scroll, and it's not gonna be you.

233
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,208
Don't get him mad.

234
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:52,088
What's he gonna do about it?
I've got him completely immobilized.

235
00:18:56,217 --> 00:19:00,013
Did I step on the wittle kitty's tail?

236
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:01,931
I'm good. I've seen enough.

237
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,434
I'll tell Shifu
he has nothing to worry about.

238
00:19:04,517 --> 00:19:05,727
No, he doesn't.

239
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,021
I'll tell him that.

240
00:19:08,104 --> 00:19:09,981
Can we please go now?

241
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,249
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

242
00:19:34,714 --> 00:19:36,132
Wait a second!

243
00:19:41,137 --> 00:19:45,809
I think there's been a slight mistake.
Everyone seems to think that I'm...

244
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,107
The Sacred Hall of Warriors! No way!

245
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,484
Look at this place.

246
00:19:56,653 --> 00:20:01,116
Master Flying Rhino's Armour,
with authentic battle damage!

247
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,036
The Sword of Heroes!

248
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,373
Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself
just by looking...

249
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:13,128
The Invisible Trident of Destiny!

250
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:17,966
I've only seen paintings of that painting.

251
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:25,807
No!

252
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,894
The Legendary Urn
of Whispering Warriors.

253
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:33,148
Said to contain the souls
of the entire Tenshu army.

254
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:37,610
Hello.

255
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,029
Have you finished sight-seeing?

256
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,198
Sorry, I should have come to you first.

257
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,242
My patience is wearing thin.

258
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:47,120
Well, I mean, it's not like
you were going anywhere.

259
00:20:47,203 --> 00:20:49,581
- Would you turn around?
- Sure.

260
00:20:49,664 --> 00:20:50,665
How's it going?

261
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,168
How do you get 5,000... Master Shifu!

262
00:20:55,795 --> 00:20:57,547
Someone broke that.

263
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,008
But I'll fix it. Do you have some

264
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:02,218
glue?

265
00:21:05,221 --> 00:21:06,222
A splinter.

266
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:09,267
So you're the legendary
Dragon Warrior?

267
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:12,479
- I guess so.
- Wrong!

268
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,813
You are not the Dragon Warrior.

269
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,274
You will never be
the Dragon Warrior until

270
00:21:16,357 --> 00:21:19,319
you have learned the secret
of the Dragon Scroll.

271
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:23,948
So, how does this work?

272
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,910
Do you have a ladder,
or a trampoline, or...

273
00:21:28,244 --> 00:21:32,290
You think it's that easy?
That I'll just hand you the secret

274
00:21:32,373 --> 00:21:34,250
- to limitless power?
- No, I...

275
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:37,337
One must first master
the highest level of kung fu.

276
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,466
And that is clearly impossible
if that one is someone like you.

277
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:42,592
Someone like me?

278
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:47,305
Yes, look at you!
This fat butt! Flabby arms!

279
00:21:47,388 --> 00:21:49,849
Those are sensitive in the flabby parts.

280
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,769
And this ridiculous belly.

281
00:21:52,852 --> 00:21:56,105
And utter disregard
for personal hygiene.

282
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,316
Now, wait a minute. That's uncalled for.

283
00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:00,944
Don't stand that close.
I can smell your breath.

284
00:22:01,027 --> 00:22:02,946
Listen, Oogway said I was...

285
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:05,698
The Wuxi Finger Hold.
Not the Wuxi Finger Hold!

286
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:08,493
Oh, you know this hold?

287
00:22:08,576 --> 00:22:11,246
Developed by Master Wuxi
in the Third Dynasty. Yes.

288
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:14,082
Then you know what happens
when I flex my pinky.

289
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,627
- No, no!
- You know the hardest part of this?

290
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,548
The hardest part is cleaning up
afterwards.

291
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,758
Okay, okay, take it easy.

292
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,261
Now listen closely, panda.

293
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:29,472
Oogway may have picked you,
but when I'm through with you,

294
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:34,435
I promise you, you're going to wish
he hadn't! Are we clear?

295
00:22:34,602 --> 00:22:37,730
Yeah, we're clear. We're so clear.

296
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,524
Good.

297
00:22:39,607 --> 00:22:41,401
I can't wait to get started.

298
00:23:21,232 --> 00:23:23,484
- Let's begin.
- Wait, wait, wait.

299
00:23:23,818 --> 00:23:25,111
What?

300
00:23:26,654 --> 00:23:29,115
- Now?
- Yes, now.

301
00:23:29,198 --> 00:23:33,494
Unless the great Oogway was wrong
and you are not the Dragon Warrior.

302
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,121
Oh, okay, well...

303
00:23:35,204 --> 00:23:39,208
I don't know
if I can do all of those moves.

304
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:42,045
Well, if we don't try,
we'll never know, will we?

305
00:23:42,128 --> 00:23:45,924
Yeah, it's just, maybe we can find
something more suited to my level.

306
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,091
What level is that?

307
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:50,595
Well, I'm not a master, but

308
00:23:50,678 --> 00:23:53,431
let's just start at zero. Level zero.

309
00:23:53,514 --> 00:23:57,602
No. There is no such thing
as level zero.

310
00:23:57,685 --> 00:24:00,438
- Maybe I can start with that.
- That?

311
00:24:00,521 --> 00:24:05,652
We use that for training children and
propping the door open when it's hot.

312
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,111
But if you insist...

313
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,781
The Furious Five!

314
00:24:09,864 --> 00:24:11,991
You're so much bigger
than your action figures.

315
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:15,495
Except for you, Mantis.
You're about the same.

316
00:24:17,538 --> 00:24:20,124
Go ahead, panda.
Show us what you can do.

317
00:24:22,001 --> 00:24:25,588
Are they gonna watch, or should I wait
till they get back to work or something?

318
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:26,756
Hit it.

319
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:31,135
Okay, yeah. I mean, I just ate.
So I'm still digesting.

320
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:34,973
So my kung fu might not be
as good as later on.

321
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,224
Just hit it.

322
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:38,434
All right.

323
00:24:39,143 --> 00:24:42,522
What you got? You got nothing,
'cause I got it right here.

324
00:24:42,605 --> 00:24:45,525
You picking on my friends?
Get ready to feel the thunder.

325
00:24:45,608 --> 00:24:47,962
I'm coming at you with crazy feet.
What you gonna do about crazy feet?

326
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,989
Come on. I'm a blur.
You've never seen bear style.

327
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,824
You've only seen praying mantis.

328
00:24:52,907 --> 00:24:54,867
Or monkey style.

329
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,829
Or I could come at you snickety-snake.

330
00:24:57,912 --> 00:25:00,289
Would you hit it!

331
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,583
All right. All right.

332
00:25:08,297 --> 00:25:11,426
Why don't you try again? A little harder.

333
00:25:13,052 --> 00:25:14,303
How's that?

334
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,524
That hurts.

335
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,700
This will be easier than I thought.

336
00:25:35,783 --> 00:25:38,286
I'm feeling a little nauseous!

337
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,039
Those are hard!

338
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:46,210
My tenders.

339
00:26:14,363 --> 00:26:16,074
How did I do?

340
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:19,619
There is now a level zero.

341
00:26:19,994 --> 00:26:22,413
- There's no words.
- No denying that.

342
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,791
I don't understand
what Master Oogway was thinking.

343
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:27,168
The poor guy's gonna get himself killed.

344
00:26:27,251 --> 00:26:29,754
He is so mighty!

345
00:26:29,837 --> 00:26:34,634
The Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky
on a ball of fire!

346
00:26:34,717 --> 00:26:37,553
When he walks,
the very ground shakes!

347
00:26:38,554 --> 00:26:42,809
One would think Master Oogway would
choose someone who knew kung fu.

348
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,936
Yeah, or could at least touch his toes.

349
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:47,396
Or even see his toes.

350
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,005
Okay.

351
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,432
Great.

352
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,699
Hi. You're up.

353
00:27:39,782 --> 00:27:41,159
I am now.

354
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,994
I was just...

355
00:27:43,077 --> 00:27:45,329
Some day, huh?

356
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:49,792
That kung fu stuff is hard work, right?
Are your biceps sore?

357
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:55,047
I've had a long
and rather disappointing day, so...

358
00:27:55,756 --> 00:27:59,093
Yeah, I should probably
get to sleep now.

359
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,596
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
- Okay, thanks.

360
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,348
It's just... Man, I'm such a big fan!

361
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:07,018
You guys were amazing
at the Battle of Weeping River.

362
00:28:07,101 --> 00:28:10,605
Outnumbered a thousand to one,
but you didn't stop. You just...

363
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,027
Sorry about that.

364
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,613
Look, you don't belong here.

365
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:23,659
I know. I know. You're right.

366
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,786
I don't have... I just...

367
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,371
My whole life I dreamed of...

368
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:32,335
No, I meant you don't belong here.
I mean, in this room. This is my room.

369
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,755
Property of Crane.

370
00:28:35,838 --> 00:28:37,715
Okay. Right, right.

371
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:40,301
So, you want to get to sleep.

372
00:28:40,384 --> 00:28:42,178
- Yeah.
- I'm keeping you up.

373
00:28:42,261 --> 00:28:44,388
We got big things tomorrow.

374
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:48,643
All right. You're awesome.
Last thing I'm gonna say. Bye-bye.

375
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,648
What was that?

376
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:55,149
I didn't say anything.

377
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,401
Okay. All right. Good night.

378
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:58,653
Sleep well.

379
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,324
That seemed a little awkward.

380
00:29:05,284 --> 00:29:07,745
Master Tigress!
I didn't mean to wake you.

381
00:29:07,828 --> 00:29:10,539
- You don't belong here.
- Yeah, of course.

382
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:11,916
This is your room.

383
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:15,253
I mean, you don't belong
in the Jade Palace.

384
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,546
You're a disgrace to kung fu,
and if you have

385
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:21,259
any respect for who we are
and what we do,

386
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,719
you will be gone by morning.

387
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,018
Big fan!

388
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:42,196
I see you have found the Sacred
Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.

389
00:29:44,573 --> 00:29:49,287
Is that what this is? Sorry. I thought
it was just a regular peach tree.

390
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:54,292
I understand.
You eat when you are upset.

391
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:58,379
Upset? I'm not upset.
What makes you think I'm upset.

392
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:02,049
So why are you upset?

393
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:10,683
I probably sucked more today
than anyone in the history of kung fu.

394
00:30:10,766 --> 00:30:14,395
In the history of China.
In the history of sucking!

395
00:30:14,478 --> 00:30:15,563
Probably.

396
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:19,317
And the Five! Man, you should've
seen them! They totally hate me.

397
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,401
Totally.

398
00:30:20,484 --> 00:30:24,572
How is Shifu ever going to turn me
into the Dragon Warrior?

399
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,576
I mean, I'm not like the Five.

400
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:32,204
I've got no claws, no wings, no venom.

401
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:35,249
Even Mantis has those thingies.

402
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:40,254
Maybe I should just quit
and go back to making noodles.

403
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,760
Quit, don't quit.

404
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:49,680
Noodles, don't noodles.

405
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:54,393
You are too concerned
with what was and what will be.

406
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:56,354
There's a saying.

407
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:59,273
Yesterday is history,

408
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,609
tomorrow is a mystery,

409
00:31:01,692 --> 00:31:04,612
but today is a gift.

410
00:31:04,695 --> 00:31:07,490
That is why it is called the present.

411
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,855
- Oh, no!
- What's happening?

412
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,441
To your battle stations! Go! Go! Go!

413
00:31:51,158 --> 00:31:52,785
Fire crossbows!

414
00:31:52,868 --> 00:31:54,203
Fire!

415
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:57,873
Fire!

416
00:32:05,589 --> 00:32:08,259
Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu.

417
00:32:08,342 --> 00:32:10,261
You're not going anywhere!
Neither is he!

418
00:32:10,344 --> 00:32:12,179
- Let go of me!
- Bring it up!

419
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,642
Wait! Bring it back!

420
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:39,415
- He's coming this way!
- He won't get far. Archers!

421
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:50,444
We're dead. So very, very dead.

422
00:33:51,153 --> 00:33:53,239
Not yet we're not. Now!

423
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,664
- Can we run now?
- Yes.

424
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,686
I'm glad Shifu sent you.

425
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,774
I was beginning to think
I'd been forgotten.

426
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,901
Fly back there and tell them

427
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:16,697
the real Dragon Warrior
is coming home.

428
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,549
- Good morning, Master!
- Good morning, Master!

429
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,297
Panda!

430
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,381
Panda!

431
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:35,966
Wake up!

432
00:35:39,511 --> 00:35:40,721
He's quit.

433
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:45,726
What do we do now, Master,
with the panda gone?

434
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:47,811
Who will be the Dragon Warrior?

435
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,981
All we can do is resume our training
and trust that in time,

436
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:53,692
the true Dragon Warrior
will be revealed.

437
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,737
What are you doing here?

438
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,657
Hi! Good morning, Master!

439
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,575
I thought I'd warm up a little.

440
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,744
You're stuck.

441
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:07,164
Stuck? No. What? Stuck?

442
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:10,959
No. This is one of my... Yeah, I'm stuck.

443
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,961
- Help him.
- Oh, dear.

444
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,590
Maybe on three. One, two,

445
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,842
three.

446
00:36:20,594 --> 00:36:22,262
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

447
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:25,516
- No, really, I appreciate...
- Ever.

448
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,645
You actually thought you could learn
to do a full split in one night?

449
00:36:29,728 --> 00:36:32,856
It takes years to develop one's flexibility!

450
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,735
And years longer to apply it in combat!

451
00:36:46,328 --> 00:36:47,871
Put that down!

452
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:52,418
The only souvenirs we collect here are
bloody knuckles and broken bones.

453
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:55,462
Yeah! Excellent.

454
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,464
Let's get started.

455
00:36:59,758 --> 00:37:01,635
- Are you ready?
- I was born ready...

456
00:37:03,637 --> 00:37:06,640
I'm sorry, brother.
I thought you said you were ready.

457
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:10,018
That was awesome! Let's go again!

458
00:37:36,378 --> 00:37:39,298
I've been taking it easy on you, panda.
But no more.

459
00:37:39,381 --> 00:37:41,717
Your next opponent will be me.

460
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,552
All right! Yeah, let's go!

461
00:37:46,054 --> 00:37:48,432
Step forth.

462
00:37:48,515 --> 00:37:51,643
The true path to victory is to find
your opponent's weakness

463
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,604
and make him suffer for it.

464
00:37:53,687 --> 00:37:54,980
Oh, yeah!

465
00:37:55,063 --> 00:37:58,442
To take his strength
and use it against him

466
00:37:58,525 --> 00:38:00,986
until he finally falls

467
00:38:01,069 --> 00:38:02,070
or quits.

468
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,198
A real warrior never quits.

469
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:07,493
Don't worry, Master. I will never quit!

470
00:38:17,711 --> 00:38:20,881
If he's smart,
he won't come back up those steps.

471
00:38:20,964 --> 00:38:22,299
But he will.

472
00:38:22,382 --> 00:38:24,635
He's not going to quit, is he?

473
00:38:24,718 --> 00:38:27,513
He's not going to quit bouncing,
I'll tell you that.

474
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,444
I thought you said acupuncture
would make me feel better.

475
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,529
Trust me, it will.

476
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:47,241
It's just not easy finding the right
nerve points under all this...

477
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:49,993
- Fat?
- Fur. I was going to say fur.

478
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,077
Sure you were.

479
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,207
Who am I to judge a warrior
based on his size? Look at me.

480
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,376
I'm over here.

481
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,879
Maybe you should look at this again.

482
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,423
Oh, okay.

483
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,262
Stop it. Stop!

484
00:39:09,429 --> 00:39:12,391
I know Master Shifu is trying
to inspire me and all,

485
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:16,270
but if I didn't know any better,
I'd say he was trying to get rid of me.

486
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,610
I know he can seem kind of heartless,

487
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,196
but he wasn't always like that.

488
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,614
According to legend,

489
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:32,202
there was once a time when
Master Shifu actually used to smile.

490
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,204
- No!
- Yes.

491
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,539
But that was before.

492
00:39:35,622 --> 00:39:37,624
Before what?

493
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,042
Before Tai Lung.

494
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,712
We're not really supposed
to talk about him.

495
00:39:41,795 --> 00:39:44,756
Well, if he's going to stay here,
he should know.

496
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,758
Guys, guys, I know about Tai Lung.

497
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:52,306
He was a student. The first ever to
master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.

498
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:56,560
And then he turned bad,
and now he's in jail.

499
00:39:56,643 --> 00:39:58,770
He wasn't just a student.

500
00:40:03,108 --> 00:40:05,944
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Shifu found him as a cub</i></font>

501
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,490
<i><font color="#80FFFF">and he raised him as his son.</i></font>

502
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,954
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And when the boy showed
talent in kung fu,</i></font>

503
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,291
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Shifu trained him.</i></font>

504
00:40:19,374 --> 00:40:23,503
<i><font color="#80FFFF">He believed in him. He told him
he was destined for greatness.</i></font>

505
00:40:25,213 --> 00:40:26,965
<i><font color="#80FFFF">It was never enough for Tai Lung.</i></font>

506
00:40:29,676 --> 00:40:31,303
<i><font color="#80FFFF">He wanted the Dragon Scroll.</i></font>

507
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:36,183
<i><font color="#80FFFF">But Oogway saw darkness
in his heart and refused.</i></font>

508
00:40:36,516 --> 00:40:40,228
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Outraged, Tai Lung
laid waste to the valley.</i></font>

509
00:40:42,689 --> 00:40:44,733
<i><font color="#80FFFF">He tried to take the scroll by force.</i></font>

510
00:40:44,816 --> 00:40:49,404
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And Shifu had to destroy
what he had created.</i></font>

511
00:40:50,697 --> 00:40:52,282
<i><font color="#80FFFF">But how could he?</i></font>

512
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:10,676
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Shifu loved Tai Lung
like he had never loved anyone before.</i></font>

513
00:41:18,892 --> 00:41:20,185
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Or since.</i></font>

514
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,822
And now he has a chance
to make things right.

515
00:41:31,905 --> 00:41:34,157
To train the true Dragon Warrior.

516
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,910
And he's stuck with you.

517
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:40,872
A big fat panda who treats it like a joke.

518
00:41:41,873 --> 00:41:42,874
That is it!

519
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:46,086
Wait! My fault!
I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.

520
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,882
And may have also stopped his heart.

521
00:41:54,636 --> 00:41:56,221
Inner peace.

522
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,683
Inner peace.

523
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,104
Inner...

524
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,607
Inner peace.

525
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:15,115
Would whoever is making
that flapping sound quiet down?

526
00:42:18,368 --> 00:42:19,619
Inner...

527
00:42:24,249 --> 00:42:26,293
Oh, Zeng.

528
00:42:26,376 --> 00:42:27,961
Excellent.

529
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,963
I could use some good news right now.

530
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,139
Master! Master!

531
00:42:39,806 --> 00:42:44,061
I have... It's... It's very bad news.

532
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,480
Shifu.

533
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:50,317
There is just news.
There is no good or bad.

534
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,695
Master, your vision...
Your vision was right.

535
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:57,157
Tai Lung has broken out of prison.
He's on his way.

536
00:42:58,658 --> 00:43:01,369
That is bad news

537
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:05,832
if you do not believe
that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.

538
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:10,170
The panda? Master,
that panda is not the Dragon Warrior.

539
00:43:10,253 --> 00:43:13,548
He wasn't meant to be here!
It was an accident.

540
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,926
There are no accidents.

541
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:20,263
Yes, I know. You've said that already.

542
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:24,559
- Twice.
- Well, that was no accident, either.

543
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:25,727
Thrice.

544
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,437
My old friend,

545
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:32,109
the panda will never fulfill
his destiny, nor you yours,

546
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:35,737
until you let go of the illusion of control.

547
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,155
Illusion?

548
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:40,242
Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu.

549
00:43:40,325 --> 00:43:43,328
I cannot make it blossom
when it suits me,

550
00:43:43,411 --> 00:43:46,665
nor make it bear fruit before its time.

551
00:43:46,748 --> 00:43:49,292
But there are things we can control.

552
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:53,463
I can control when the fruit will fall.

553
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,216
And I can control

554
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,302
where to plant the seed.

555
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,888
That is no illusion, Master.

556
00:44:03,598 --> 00:44:05,600
Yes.

557
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:08,061
But no matter what you do

558
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,064
that seed will grow to be a peach tree.

559
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:15,986
You may wish for an apple
or an orange, but you will get a peach.

560
00:44:16,069 --> 00:44:19,698
But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!

561
00:44:19,781 --> 00:44:22,450
Maybe it can.

562
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:25,328
If you are willing to guide it.

563
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,247
To nurture it.

564
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:28,707
To believe in it.

565
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:31,251
But how? How?

566
00:44:31,334 --> 00:44:33,295
I need your help, Master.

567
00:44:33,378 --> 00:44:37,090
No, you just need to believe.

568
00:44:37,757 --> 00:44:40,093
Promise me, Shifu.

569
00:44:40,677 --> 00:44:43,346
Promise me you will believe.

570
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:47,017
I will try.

571
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,352
Good.

572
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,523
My time has come.

573
00:44:55,734 --> 00:45:00,071
You must continue
your journey without me.

574
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:01,865
What are you... Wait!

575
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,202
Master!

576
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,621
You can't leave me!

577
00:45:11,374 --> 00:45:14,002
You must believe.

578
00:45:14,961 --> 00:45:16,546
Master!

579
00:45:46,993 --> 00:45:49,621
Yeah, so I'm like,
"Fine, you may be a wolf,

580
00:45:49,704 --> 00:45:52,666
"you may be the scariest bandit
in Haijin Province,

581
00:45:52,999 --> 00:45:54,793
"but you're a lousy tipper."

582
00:45:54,876 --> 00:45:57,837
Really? So how did you
get out of there alive?

583
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,007
I mean, I didn't actually say that,

584
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:02,842
but I thought it

585
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,678
in my mind.

586
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:07,847
If he could read my mind,
he'd be, like, "What?"

587
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,558
Order up! Hope you like it.

588
00:46:12,477 --> 00:46:15,689
- This is really good!
- No, come on.

589
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:20,068
Try my dad's Secret Ingredient Soup.
He actually knows the secret ingredient.

590
00:46:20,151 --> 00:46:22,529
What are you talking about?
This is amazing!

591
00:46:22,612 --> 00:46:25,532
- You're a really good cook.
- I wish my mouth was bigger.

592
00:46:25,615 --> 00:46:27,492
Tigress, you've got to try this.

593
00:46:27,575 --> 00:46:31,204
It is said that the Dragon Warrior
can survive for months at a time

594
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,832
on nothing but the dew
of a single ginkgo leaf

595
00:46:33,915 --> 00:46:35,667
and the energy of the universe.

596
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:41,339
I guess my body doesn't know
it's the Dragon Warrior yet.

597
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:46,428
I'm gonna need a lot more
than dew and universe juice.

598
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:53,893
- What?
- Nothing, Master Shifu.

599
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,231
You'll never be the Dragon Warrior

600
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,900
unless you lose 500 pounds
and brush your teeth!

601
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:05,488
What is that noise you're making?
Laughter? I never heard of it!

602
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:08,366
Work hard, panda, and maybe someday

603
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,368
you will have ears like mine.

604
00:47:11,953 --> 00:47:13,371
That's good.

605
00:47:13,955 --> 00:47:17,375
Ears. It's not working for you?
I thought they were pretty good.

606
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:18,835
It's Shifu!

607
00:47:18,918 --> 00:47:21,755
Of course it's Shifu.
What do you think I'm doing?

608
00:47:23,548 --> 00:47:25,133
Master Shifu!

609
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,846
You think this is funny?

610
00:47:29,929 --> 00:47:32,891
Tai Lung has escaped
and you're acting like children!

611
00:47:32,974 --> 00:47:35,268
- What?
- He is coming for the Dragon Scroll,

612
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,729
and you are the only one
who can stop him.

613
00:47:41,399 --> 00:47:44,027
And here I am saying
you got no sense of humor.

614
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,363
I'm gonna stop Tai Lung.

615
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:49,282
What? You're serious? And I have to...

616
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:54,120
Master Oogway will stop him,
he did it before, he'll do it again.

617
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,747
Oogway cannot!

618
00:47:56,247 --> 00:47:57,624
Not any more.

619
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,711
Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.

620
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,463
- The panda?
- Yes, the panda!

621
00:48:03,546 --> 00:48:07,133
Master, let us stop Tai Lung.
This is what you've trained us for.

622
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:10,428
No! It is not your destiny
to defeat Tai Lung.

623
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:12,764
It is his!

624
00:48:12,847 --> 00:48:13,973
Where'd he go?

625
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:24,442
You cannot leave!
A real warrior never quits.

626
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:26,111
Watch me.

627
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,614
Come on.

628
00:48:29,697 --> 00:48:33,535
How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung?
I can't even beat you to the stairs.

629
00:48:33,618 --> 00:48:36,621
You will beat him
because you are the Dragon Warrior.

630
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,667
You don't believe that.
You never believed that.

631
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:43,753
From the beginning,
you've tried to get rid of me.

632
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:46,131
Yes! I was.

633
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:51,344
But now I ask you to trust in your master
as I have come to trust in mine.

634
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:56,141
You're not my master.
And I'm not the Dragon Warrior.

635
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:57,851
Then why didn't you quit?

636
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,562
You knew I was trying to get rid of you,
yet you stayed.

637
00:49:00,645 --> 00:49:02,730
Yeah, I stayed.

638
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:06,568
I stayed because every time
you threw a brick at my head

639
00:49:06,651 --> 00:49:11,030
or said I smelled, it hurt,
but it could never hurt more

640
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:14,367
than it did every day
of my life just being me.

641
00:49:15,326 --> 00:49:19,664
I stayed because I thought,
if anyone could change me,

642
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:23,042
could make me not me,

643
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,502
it was you,

644
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:27,672
the greatest kung fu teacher
in all of China!

645
00:49:27,755 --> 00:49:29,340
But I can change you!

646
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:32,969
I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior!
And I will!

647
00:49:33,052 --> 00:49:37,015
Come on. Tai Lung is
on his way here right now.

648
00:49:37,098 --> 00:49:40,477
Even if it takes him a hundred years
to get here, how are you

649
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:44,856
gonna change this
into the Dragon Warrior?

650
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:48,443
How?

651
00:49:50,069 --> 00:49:51,070
How?

652
00:49:53,823 --> 00:49:56,034
- How?
- I don't know!

653
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:05,627
I don't know.

654
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,427
That's what I thought.

655
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:55,260
This is what you trained me for.

656
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:03,393
Tigress!

657
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,440
Don't try and stop me.

658
00:51:12,151 --> 00:51:13,695
We're not trying to stop you.

659
00:51:13,778 --> 00:51:14,778
What?

660
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:16,698
We're coming with you!

661
00:52:29,937 --> 00:52:33,483
What? I eat when I'm upset, okay?

662
00:52:34,567 --> 00:52:35,943
No need to explain.

663
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:37,528
I thought you might be Monkey.

664
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:40,323
He hides his almond cookies
on the top shelf.

665
00:53:01,135 --> 00:53:02,887
Don't tell Monkey.

666
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:06,140
- Look at you.
- Yeah, I know, I disgust you.

667
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:09,185
No, I mean, how did you get up there?

668
00:53:09,268 --> 00:53:12,063
I don't know. I guess...

669
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:14,691
I don't know. I was getting a cookie.

670
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,651
Yet you are ten feet off the ground.

671
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:20,029
And have done a perfect spilt.

672
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:23,074
No, this? This is just

673
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,118
an accident.

674
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:32,417
There are no accidents.

675
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,584
Come with me.

676
00:53:41,592 --> 00:53:45,012
I know you're trying to be
all mystical and kung fuey,

677
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:47,807
but could you at least
tell me where we're going?

678
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,194
You dragged me

679
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:01,946
all the way out here

680
00:54:02,029 --> 00:54:03,448
for a bath?

681
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:08,286
Panda,

682
00:54:08,369 --> 00:54:11,998
we do not wash our pits
in the Pool of Sacred Tears.

683
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:14,250
The Pool of...

684
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:17,253
This is where Oogway
unraveled the mysteries

685
00:54:17,336 --> 00:54:19,213
of harmony and focus.

686
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:21,799
This is the birthplace

687
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,176
of kung fu.

688
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:39,400
Do you want to learn kung fu?

689
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:40,484
Yeah!

690
00:54:40,526 --> 00:54:44,030
Then I am your master!

691
00:54:44,113 --> 00:54:45,698
Okay!

692
00:54:46,991 --> 00:54:48,075
Don't cry.

693
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,494
Okay.

694
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,210
When you focus on kung fu,

695
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:59,420
when you concentrate,

696
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:01,172
you stink.

697
00:55:01,255 --> 00:55:02,965
Perhaps that is my fault.

698
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:06,511
I cannot train you the way
I have trained the Five.

699
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:09,680
I now see that the way
to get through to you

700
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:11,057
is with this.

701
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:13,893
Oh, great, 'cause I am hungry.

702
00:55:14,852 --> 00:55:15,853
Good.

703
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:18,648
When you have been trained,
you may eat.

704
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:21,108
Let us begin.

705
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,097
After you, panda.

706
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:35,141
Just like that?

707
00:56:35,224 --> 00:56:38,728
No sit-ups? No 10-mile hike?

708
00:56:38,811 --> 00:56:43,316
I vowed to train you, and you
have been trained. You are free to eat.

709
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,323
Enjoy.

710
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,326
Hey!

711
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:56,537
I said you are free to eat.
Have a dumpling.

712
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,332
Hey!

713
00:57:05,546 --> 00:57:07,506
You are free to eat.

714
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,508
- Am I?
- Are you?

715
00:58:35,928 --> 00:58:37,471
I'm not hungry.

716
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,268
Master.

717
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:13,799
Cut it!

718
00:59:30,983 --> 00:59:32,777
Where's the Dragon Warrior?

719
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,863
How do you know
you're not looking at her?

720
00:59:35,946 --> 00:59:38,115
You think I'm a fool?

721
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:41,827
I know you're not the Dragon Warrior.
None of you!

722
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:45,164
I heard how he fell out of the sky
in a ball of fire.

723
00:59:45,247 --> 00:59:49,668
That he's a warrior unlike
anything the world has ever seen.

724
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:55,341
- Po?
- So that is his name. Po.

725
00:59:55,424 --> 00:59:58,511
Finally, a worthy opponent.

726
00:59:58,594 --> 01:00:01,097
Our battle will be legendary!

727
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:22,785
We've got this. Help her.

728
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,561
Monkey!

729
01:00:48,644 --> 01:00:50,479
Go!

730
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:51,730
What was I thinking?

731
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:03,242
Mantis!

732
01:01:07,913 --> 01:01:09,373
Now!

733
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:57,588
Shifu taught you well.

734
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:02,551
But he didn't teach you everything.

735
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:08,140
You have done well, panda.

736
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:11,894
Done well? Done well?

737
01:02:11,977 --> 01:02:13,312
I've done awesome!

738
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:18,192
The mark of a true hero is humility.

739
01:02:18,275 --> 01:02:20,986
But, yes, you have done

740
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:22,905
awesome.

741
01:02:30,162 --> 01:02:33,457
Guys? Guys? They're dead!

742
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:36,961
No, they're breathing. They're asleep?
No, their eyes are open.

743
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:39,046
We were no match for his nerve attack.

744
01:02:39,129 --> 01:02:41,340
He's gotten stronger.

745
01:02:41,423 --> 01:02:43,717
Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?

746
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,470
He's too fast!

747
01:02:46,553 --> 01:02:48,138
Sorry, Po.

748
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,183
I thought we could stop him.

749
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,102
He could have killed you.

750
01:02:53,185 --> 01:02:54,228
Why didn't he?

751
01:02:54,311 --> 01:02:59,108
So you could come back and strike fear
into our hearts. But it won't work.

752
01:02:59,191 --> 01:03:03,112
It might. I mean, a little.

753
01:03:03,195 --> 01:03:04,446
I'm pretty scared.

754
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:05,990
You can defeat him, panda!

755
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:08,993
Are you kidding? If they can't?

756
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:12,079
They're five masters. I'm just one me.

757
01:03:12,162 --> 01:03:15,541
But you will have
the one thing that no one else does.

758
01:03:20,879 --> 01:03:23,340
You really believe I'm ready?

759
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:25,092
You are,

760
01:03:25,175 --> 01:03:26,468
Po.

761
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:19,021
Behold the Dragon Scroll.

762
01:04:19,104 --> 01:04:21,023
It is yours.

763
01:04:21,106 --> 01:04:24,026
Wait. What happens when I read it?

764
01:04:24,109 --> 01:04:25,110
No one knows.

765
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:28,155
But legend says you will be able
to hear a butterfly's wing beat.

766
01:04:28,238 --> 01:04:30,449
Really? That's cool.

767
01:04:30,532 --> 01:04:33,369
Yes. And see light in the deepest cave.

768
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:36,330
You will feel the universe
in motion around you.

769
01:04:36,997 --> 01:04:38,415
Can I punch through walls?

770
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:40,876
- Can I do a quadruple back flip?
- Focus.

771
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:42,519
- Will I have invisibility...
- Focus.

772
01:04:42,544 --> 01:04:43,921
- Focus.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

773
01:04:44,004 --> 01:04:46,882
Read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny.

774
01:04:46,965 --> 01:04:49,176
Read it and become

775
01:04:49,259 --> 01:04:50,969
the Dragon Warrior.

776
01:04:57,893 --> 01:04:59,311
It's impossible to open.

777
01:05:00,312 --> 01:05:03,607
Okay. Come on, baby. Come on, now.

778
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:07,444
Thank you.

779
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:09,947
I probably loosened it up for you though.

780
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,783
Okay, here goes.

781
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:26,422
- It's blank.
- What?

782
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:30,134
- Here, look.
- No, I am forbidden to look upon...

783
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:38,684
Blank. I don't...

784
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:40,978
I don't understand.

785
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:44,940
Okay. So, like,

786
01:05:45,023 --> 01:05:48,277
Oogway was
just a crazy old turtle after all.

787
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,946
No. Oogway was wiser than us all.

788
01:05:51,029 --> 01:05:55,075
Oh, come on! Face it,
he picked me by accident.

789
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:59,288
Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior.
Who am I kidding?

790
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:01,999
But who will stop Tai Lung?

791
01:06:02,082 --> 01:06:05,127
He'll destroy everything and everyone.

792
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:06,628
No.

793
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:12,050
Evacuate the valley. You must protect
the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.

794
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:14,511
- What about you, Master?
- I will fight him.

795
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:17,306
- What?
- I can hold him off long enough

796
01:06:17,389 --> 01:06:18,807
for everyone to escape.

797
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:21,310
But, Shifu, he'll kill you.

798
01:06:21,393 --> 01:06:24,229
Then I will finally have paid
for my mistake.

799
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:27,316
Listen to me, all of you.

800
01:06:27,399 --> 01:06:30,903
It is time for you to continue
your journey without me.

801
01:06:30,986 --> 01:06:33,989
I am very proud
to have been your master.

802
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,137
We've got to get them out safely.

803
01:06:57,221 --> 01:06:59,515
Come, little one. Let's find your mama.

804
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:03,185
Viper, gather the southern farmers.
Mantis, the north.

805
01:07:03,268 --> 01:07:05,020
Crane, light the way.

806
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:27,125
Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.

807
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:37,219
Hey, Dad.

808
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:39,137
Po!

809
01:07:45,018 --> 01:07:47,145
Good to have you back, son.

810
01:07:49,606 --> 01:07:51,066
Good to be back.

811
01:07:51,149 --> 01:07:52,818
Let's go, Po.

812
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:58,115
So for our next shop, it's time to face it,

813
01:07:58,198 --> 01:08:01,702
the future of noodles
is dice-cut vegetables,

814
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:04,246
no longer slices.

815
01:08:04,329 --> 01:08:07,583
Also, I was thinking, maybe this time

816
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:11,086
we'll have a kitchen
you can actually stand up in.

817
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:13,505
You like that?

818
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:24,308
Po, I'm sorry things didn't work out.

819
01:08:24,391 --> 01:08:27,436
It just wasn't meant to be.

820
01:08:30,897 --> 01:08:33,400
Po, forget everything else.

821
01:08:33,483 --> 01:08:35,652
Your destiny still awaits.

822
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:40,866
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs deep through our veins.

823
01:08:40,949 --> 01:08:42,868
I don't know, Dad.

824
01:08:42,951 --> 01:08:46,955
Honestly, sometimes
I can't believe I'm actually your son.

825
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:51,418
Po,

826
01:08:51,501 --> 01:08:55,922
I think it's time I told you
something I should have told you

827
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:58,050
a long time ago.

828
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:00,510
Okay.

829
01:09:01,219 --> 01:09:05,432
The secret ingredient
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

830
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:12,814
Come here. The secret ingredient is

831
01:09:12,898 --> 01:09:13,899
nothing.

832
01:09:15,275 --> 01:09:17,694
You heard me. Nothing!

833
01:09:17,778 --> 01:09:20,238
There is no secret ingredient!

834
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:23,367
Wait, wait.
It's just plain old noodle soup?

835
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:25,952
You don't add some kind of
special sauce or something?

836
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:28,330
Don't have to.
To make something special,

837
01:09:28,413 --> 01:09:31,416
you just have to believe it's special.

838
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:43,970
There is no secret ingredient.

839
01:10:06,576 --> 01:10:09,371
I have come home, Master.

840
01:10:09,454 --> 01:10:12,708
This is no longer your home.
And I am no longer your master.

841
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:16,712
Oh, yes. You have a new favourite.

842
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:19,881
So where is this Po?

843
01:10:21,299 --> 01:10:22,551
Did I scare him off?

844
01:10:22,634 --> 01:10:24,970
This battle is between you and me.

845
01:10:26,346 --> 01:10:29,474
So, that is how it's going to be.

846
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,601
That is how it must be.

847
01:10:46,032 --> 01:10:50,579
I rotted in jail for 20 years
because of your weakness!

848
01:10:50,662 --> 01:10:53,039
Obeying your master is not weakness!

849
01:10:53,123 --> 01:10:55,917
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior.

850
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:58,128
<i><font color="#80FFFF">You always knew.</i></font>

851
01:10:58,211 --> 01:11:03,216
<i><font color="#80FFFF">But when Oogway said otherwise,
what did you do?</i></font>

852
01:11:04,342 --> 01:11:06,887
<i><font color="#80FFFF">What did you do?</i></font>

853
01:11:09,347 --> 01:11:10,432
Nothing!

854
01:11:10,515 --> 01:11:13,351
You were not meant to be the Dragon
Warrior! That was not my fault!

855
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:15,187
Not your fault?

856
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:17,397
Who filled my head with dreams?

857
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:19,816
Who drove me to train
until my bones cracked?

858
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:22,652
Who denied me my destiny?

859
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:34,498
It was never my decision to make!

860
01:11:39,961 --> 01:11:41,254
It is now.

861
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:49,888
Give me the scroll!

862
01:11:49,971 --> 01:11:51,223
I would rather die.

863
01:12:41,606 --> 01:12:44,734
All I ever did, I did to make you proud!

864
01:12:44,901 --> 01:12:47,404
Tell me how proud you are, Shifu!

865
01:12:48,363 --> 01:12:49,865
Tell me!

866
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:52,117
Tell me!

867
01:13:02,419 --> 01:13:05,797
I have...
I have always been proud of you.

868
01:13:06,923 --> 01:13:10,218
From the first moment, I've been

869
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:12,596
proud of you.

870
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:15,056
And it was my pride

871
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:17,142
that blinded me.

872
01:13:17,225 --> 01:13:20,812
I loved you too much
to see what you were becoming,

873
01:13:21,813 --> 01:13:24,065
what I

874
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:26,151
was turning you into.

875
01:13:26,943 --> 01:13:28,904
I'm...

876
01:13:28,987 --> 01:13:29,988
I'm sorry.

877
01:13:38,496 --> 01:13:41,207
I don't want your apology.

878
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:42,834
I want my scroll!

879
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,922
What?

880
01:13:47,005 --> 01:13:48,214
Where is it?

881
01:13:49,549 --> 01:13:54,179
Dragon Warrior has taken the scroll
halfway across China by now.

882
01:13:55,305 --> 01:13:58,433
You will never see that scroll, Tai Lung.

883
01:13:58,516 --> 01:13:59,851
Never.

884
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:01,770
Never.

885
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:10,070
Stairs.

886
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:14,282
Who are you?

887
01:14:14,366 --> 01:14:19,412
Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.

888
01:14:22,415 --> 01:14:23,750
You?

889
01:14:24,709 --> 01:14:26,670
Him? He's a panda.

890
01:14:26,753 --> 01:14:30,632
You're a panda. What are
you gonna do, big guy? Sit on me?

891
01:14:30,715 --> 01:14:32,634
Don't tempt me.

892
01:14:32,717 --> 01:14:36,721
No. I'm gonna use this.

893
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:38,431
You want it? Come and get it.

894
01:14:40,183 --> 01:14:41,476
Finally!

895
01:15:07,502 --> 01:15:08,962
That scroll is mine!

896
01:16:02,807 --> 01:16:03,808
Lightning!

897
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:41,012
The scroll has given him power!

898
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:43,223
No!

899
01:17:19,342 --> 01:17:23,263
Finally! Oh, yes.

900
01:17:23,346 --> 01:17:28,226
The power of the Dragon Scroll is mine!

901
01:17:33,022 --> 01:17:35,066
It's nothing!

902
01:17:37,026 --> 01:17:39,612
It's okay. I didn't get it
the first time, either.

903
01:17:40,113 --> 01:17:41,156
What?

904
01:17:42,323 --> 01:17:44,117
There is no secret ingredient.

905
01:17:47,662 --> 01:17:48,913
It's just you.

906
01:17:58,673 --> 01:17:59,716
Stop it!

907
01:17:59,799 --> 01:18:01,593
I'm gonna pee.

908
01:18:03,219 --> 01:18:04,387
Don't.

909
01:18:04,470 --> 01:18:06,139
Don't! Don't!

910
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:15,708
You

911
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:18,002
can't defeat me.

912
01:19:22,465 --> 01:19:23,675
You...

913
01:19:25,009 --> 01:19:26,803
You're just a big

914
01:19:26,886 --> 01:19:28,471
fat

915
01:19:28,554 --> 01:19:29,555
panda!

916
01:19:30,515 --> 01:19:33,643
I'm not a big fat panda.

917
01:19:33,726 --> 01:19:36,020
I'm the big fat panda.

918
01:19:38,189 --> 01:19:39,607
The Wuxi Finger Hold!

919
01:19:39,691 --> 01:19:41,109
Oh, you know this hold?

920
01:19:41,192 --> 01:19:45,113
You're bluffing. You're bluffing.
Shifu didn't teach you that.

921
01:19:45,196 --> 01:19:46,906
Nope.

922
01:19:46,990 --> 01:19:49,200
I figured it out. Skadoosh.

923
01:20:09,721 --> 01:20:10,930
Look!

924
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:14,058
The Dragon Warrior.

925
01:20:41,544 --> 01:20:46,424
That's my boy! That big, lovely
kung fu warrior is my son!

926
01:20:48,468 --> 01:20:49,594
Yes!

927
01:20:50,845 --> 01:20:52,430
Thanks, Dad.

928
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:03,483
Hey, guys.

929
01:21:07,779 --> 01:21:09,113
Master.

930
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:10,615
- Master.
- Master.

931
01:21:13,534 --> 01:21:15,286
Master?

932
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:16,829
Master Shifu!

933
01:21:30,468 --> 01:21:31,844
Master!

934
01:21:31,928 --> 01:21:34,013
Shifu, are you okay?

935
01:21:35,765 --> 01:21:37,141
Po.

936
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:39,143
You're alive.

937
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:40,436
Or we're both dead.

938
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:44,440
No, Master, I didn't die.
I defeated Tai Lung.

939
01:21:44,524 --> 01:21:45,650
You did?

940
01:21:49,946 --> 01:21:55,660
Wow. It is as Oogway foretold.

941
01:21:55,743 --> 01:21:59,247
You are the Dragon Warrior.

942
01:21:59,997 --> 01:22:02,500
You have brought peace

943
01:22:02,583 --> 01:22:05,336
to this valley

944
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:07,588
and...

945
01:22:07,672 --> 01:22:09,298
And to me.

946
01:22:09,382 --> 01:22:10,675
Thank you.

947
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:15,721
Thank you, Po.

948
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:18,391
Thank you. Thank you.

949
01:22:23,896 --> 01:22:28,901
No! Master! No, no, no,
don't die, Shifu, please!

950
01:22:28,985 --> 01:22:31,696
I'm not dying, you idiot!

951
01:22:31,779 --> 01:22:33,739
Dragon Warrior.

952
01:22:35,032 --> 01:22:39,871
I am simply at peace. Finally.

953
01:22:42,582 --> 01:22:45,543
So, I should stop talking?

954
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:47,879
If you can.

955
01:23:06,022 --> 01:23:07,607
Want to get something to eat?

956
01:23:10,276 --> 01:23:11,402
Yeah.
