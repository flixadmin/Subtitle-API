1
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,824
Man 1: Look out! Man 2: Fire!

2
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,727
Davos: A band of 20 men, maybe less.

3
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,021
They were in and out
before anyone spotted them.

4
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:12,275
Burned our food stores to the ground,
all our siege weapons destroyed.

5
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,528
- Dozens of tents were...
- Horses?

6
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,822
We're still getting a count,
but hundreds are dead.

7
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,701
Twenty men rode into our camp
without a single guard sounding the alarm?

8
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,096
The northerners know more about their land
than we ever will.

9
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,480
Put last night's guards in chains.

10
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,724
Either they fell asleep
or they conspired with the enemy.

11
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,210
- Find out the truth and then hang them.
- Your grace.

12
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,588
Unless there's a thaw,
we can't press foward to winterfell

13
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,133
and we don't have enough food
to get us back to castle black.

14
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,968
We're not returning to castle black.

15
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,388
Forgive me, I never claimed
to be an expert in military matters,

16
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,100
but if we can't march fon/vard
and we won't march back...

17
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,866
Have the dead horses butchered for meat.

18
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,241
Man 1: Halt!

19
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,661
Man 2: Halt!

20
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,374
Man 3: There it is!

21
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,875
Open the gates.

22
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,768
Jon: It was a failure.

23
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,353
It wasn't.

24
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,773
I went to save them. I failed.

25
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,026
You didn't fail him.

26
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,112
Or him.

27
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,781
Or her.

28
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,535
Every one of them is alive
because of you and no one else.

29
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,289
I don't think that fact's lost on them.

30
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,887
You have a good heart.

31
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,057
It'll get us all killed.

32
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,148
Get out of my way.

33
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,926
You sent for me?

34
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,196
Find some healthy horses
and a few knights to guard you.

35
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,700
I'm sending you back to castle black.

36
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,307
Tell the lord commander
his king commands him

37
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,977
to send food, supplies, fresh horses.

38
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,687
In return, when I take the throne,

39
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,523
I'll make sure the night's
watch has all the men it requires.

40
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,901
He can guard all 19 castles on the wall
if he so wishes.

41
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:10,240
You named me your hand.

42
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,825
Yes.

43
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,743
The king's hand should
never abandon the king,

44
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,161
especially in time of war.

45
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,247
You're not abandoning me.
You're obeying a command.

46
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,541
A boy with a scroll
could deliver this message.

47
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,210
And if Jon snow refuses
the boy with the scroll,

48
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,878
what does the boy say?

49
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,423
I didn't name you hand
for your expertize in military matters.

50
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,634
Ride for castle black.
Don't come back empty-handed.

51
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,728
Perhaps queen selyse
and Princess shireen could accompany me.

52
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,146
My family stays with me.

53
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,107
At least let me take shireen.

54
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,568
A siege is no place for a little girl.

55
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,945
My family stays with me.

56
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,357
What's this one now?

57
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:30,236
The dance of dragons: A true telling
by grand maester munkun.

58
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,698
Now that sounds like a proper story.

59
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,451
Ser Byron Swann wanted
to kill the dragon vhagar.

60
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,014
He polished his shield for a week
so that it was like a mirror.

61
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,247
And he crouched behind
it and crept fonnard,

62
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,374
hoping the dragon
would only see its own reflection.

63
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,503
But the dragon saw a dumb man
holding a mirrored shield.

64
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,213
And burned him to a crisp.

65
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:53,176
Thus ending the dragon-slaying career
of ser Byron Swann.

66
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,265
I made you something.

67
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,024
- Do you like it?
- He's beautiful.

68
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,903
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

69
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,447
Will you make me a Doe, too?
So that he can have company?

70
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,199
Of course I will.

71
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,244
But why am I getting a present?

72
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,705
Because you deserve it.

73
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,961
My son was always on me,
trying to teach me to read.

74
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,171
Gods, I was stubborn about it.

75
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,966
Made it this far without reading.

76
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,385
Seemed to me I could make it to the grave.

77
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,722
Wish I'd listened to him.

78
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,476
This is my own poor way
of saying "thank you."

79
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,274
For teaching me to be a grown-up.

80
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,404
I'll be gone for a few days.

81
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,532
I want to hear all about
the dance of dragons when I'm back.

82
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,701
You'll read it yourself.

83
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,765
Prince doran.

84
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,268
Forgive us. We started without you.

85
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,146
Please, sit.

86
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,732
Princess myrcella.

87
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,400
Uncle.

88
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,235
What a lovely dress.

89
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,445
You don't like it?

90
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,155
- You must be cold.
- Not at all.

91
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,116
The dornish climate agrees with me.

92
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,995
Prince trystane.

93
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,290
How's yourjaw?

94
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,168
A fleabite.

95
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,920
What are you doing in dorne?

96
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,214
Looking after the safety of my niece.

97
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,467
And rather than send a raven
or speak to me directly,

98
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,469
you decided to enter my country in secret

99
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,721
and abduct our guest by force?

100
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,098
We received a threatening message.

101
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,019
The Princess's necklace
in the jaws of a viper.

102
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,356
That necklace was stolen from my room.

103
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,281
Oh, excellent.

104
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,367
A last meal before the beheading?

105
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,077
Oh, I can't behead you.

106
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,412
Many in dorne want war.

107
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,748
But I've seen war.

108
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,626
I've seen the bodies
piled on the battlefields.

109
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,837
I've seen the orphans
starving in the cities.

110
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,923
I don't want to lead
my people into that hell.

111
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,759
No, you want to break bread
with the lannisters.

112
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,012
And that is precisely what we are doing.

113
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,725
Let us drink to tommen,
the first of his name,

114
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,686
king of the andals and the first men,

115
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,479
lord of the seven kingdoms.

116
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:14,043
King tommen insists
on his sister's return to the capital?

117
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,422
I'm afraid he does.

118
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,426
I cannot disobey my king's command.

119
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,138
She will return with you to king's landing.

120
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,516
And my son, prince trystane,
will accompany you both.

121
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:32,312
If the alliance between
the iron throne and dome is to continue,

122
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,855
their engagement must stand.

123
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:35,898
Iaccept

124
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,358
one more thing.

125
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:41,446
My brother was named to the small council
before his death.

126
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,325
Your father understood the importance
of keeping dome in the fold.

127
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,451
With oberyn gone,

128
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,787
trystane will take his place
on the small council.

129
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,039
You have my word.

130
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,416
The word of a kingslayer.

131
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,047
No wonder you can't stand.
You have no spine.

132
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:04,093
You are mother to four of my nieces,
girls I love very much.

133
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,971
For their sake,
I hope you live a long and happy life.

134
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,432
Speak to me that way again, and you won't.

135
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:20,943
May I inquire as to the
fate of my man bronn?

136
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:24,072
Tell me, in king's landing,

137
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:27,325
how do they punish a commoner
who strikes a prince?

138
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,951
He said it was just a fleabite.

139
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:35,458
The fault is mine. Bronn is merely
a soldier following my orders.

140
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,961
If anyone should be punished, it's me.

141
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,964
Prince trystane must learn judgment
if he is to rule one day.

142
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,716
I'll let him decide.

143
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,391
I have learned the value of mercy
from my father.

144
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,644
- I'll set your man free.
- You're a good man.

145
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,438
On one condition.

146
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,615
Why do we play? I'm better than you.

147
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,992
I'll always be better than you.

148
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,870
Have I ever missed once?

149
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,081
I don't think I have. I can't recall.

150
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,792
You must love humiliation. Or pain.

151
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:22,046
Which do you love most?

152
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,882
That one hurt, didn't it?

153
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,094
You going to cry?

154
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,929
Give up, little sister.

155
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,223
- You're going to miss.
- Oh, I never miss.

156
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,600
You will. You're thinking too much.

157
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,521
Now you're nervous. "What if she's right?"

158
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:42,984
Luck.

159
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,777
Now it's my turn.

160
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:48,197
You're too slow.
You've always been too slow.

161
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,883
Am I gonna be happy
at the end of this walk?

162
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,885
You'll find out very soon.

163
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,681
Say it one more time, handsome.

164
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,099
Who am I?

165
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,145
The most beautiful woman in the world.

166
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,605
And that's the truth.

167
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,857
Slut.

168
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:28,070
Prince doran, ser bronn of the Blackwater.

169
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,740
I didn't realize
there were knights of the Blackwater.

170
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,283
Only the one.

171
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,827
I believe you've already
met prince trystane.

172
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,246
Phnce.

173
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,998
Sorry about the other day.

174
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,501
Jaime: Prince trystane here
is a man of mercy.

175
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,086
He's agreed to Grant you your freedom.

176
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,423
I'm glad to hear it.

177
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,343
Pie looks good.

178
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,929
There was one condition.

179
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,649
Perhaps some soup instead.

180
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,779
Arya: Oysters, clams, and cookies.

181
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,700
Oysters, clams, and cookies.

182
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,704
Oysters, clams, and cookies.

183
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,831
Oysters, clams, and...

184
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:23,626
How much for your little clam?

185
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,970
Oysters, clams, and cookies.

186
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,850
Oysters, clams, and cookies.

187
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,755
Come on.

188
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,884
Some oysters, girl!

189
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,096
I'm talking to you.

190
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,015
Is, uh...

191
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,519
- Girl!
- Man: Tie her up!

192
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,647
Thin man: Are you deaf? Girl!

193
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,692
Girl!

194
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,490
My lord.

195
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,204
Sailor: My lord.

196
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,789
Tycho: Lord Tyrell.

197
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,583
On behalf of the iron bank,

198
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,378
may I be the first to welcome you
to the free city of braavos.

199
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,213
I hope your journey was trouble-free.

200
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,967
A bit of chop the last few days.
Nothing too awful.

201
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,803
Good to see the old chap
still guarding the harbor.

202
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,056
And how goes the harvest in the reach?

203
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:05,853
Ah, the vintners say this might be the
best year for red grapes in half a century.

204
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,606
If we come to a satisfactory arrangement,

205
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:13,653
I'll be sure to send
a cask of the arbor's finest your way.

206
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,280
I'm afraid I don't partake.

207
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:28,125
Some consider usury
distasteful, dishonorable.

208
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,835
Pure nonsense, of course.

209
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,004
I'm glad we see eye to eye on this matter.

210
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:37,218
Did you know that at one point maegor III
tried to outlaw it in the seven kingdoms?

211
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,679
Wanted to arrest anyone
caught charging interest

212
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,139
and cut off both their hands.

213
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,350
Most unfortunate for the glovers.

214
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,435
Mace: If a man charges
no interest on a loan,

215
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:50,147
then he has nothing to gain
and everything to lose, so why chance it?

216
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:54,402
Whereas the promise of reward
makes a man willing to gamble.

217
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:57,905
We are not gamblers
here at the iron bank, lord Tyrell.

218
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,366
You are the world's best gamblers.

219
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:04,203
And all those bets you won built this.

220
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,049
Mace: We should celebrate.

221
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,677
Tycho: I'm afraid I still
have a good deal of work to do.

222
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,322
Mace: Nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?
Tycho: I don't have that gift.

223
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,724
It's not a gift. It's a
skill. Anyone can learn it.

224
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:29,186
So give me a kiss by the long canal

225
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:33,232
and give me two kisses in salty town

226
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:37,278
for we're going to die tomorrow

227
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,657
the bareheaded beggar
the king with his crown...

228
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,861
Meryn: Thought that old shit
would never stop singing.

229
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,078
Wasn't bad, though.

230
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,622
The tyrells can all rot in hell.

231
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,207
Treasonous cunts.

232
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,085
They were going to make
that boy-fucker renly king.

233
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,297
This is the place, lads.

234
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,966
The sleekest little minks in braavos.

235
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,594
- You buying?
- Oh, I'm buying.

236
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,637
But I never was good at sharing.

237
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,827
Sell your fish somewhere else.

238
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:29,705
Oh, let her in, brusco. I'm hungry.

239
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,665
Come here, sweetness.

240
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,631
They say oysters get the juices flowing.

241
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,342
We'll take half a dozen.

242
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,637
Three coppers.

243
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,973
Here's a silver because the lady likes you.

244
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,085
Too old.

245
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,840
Brea.

246
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,565
Too old.

247
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:43,112
Madame: I have just the one. Anara.

248
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,574
Our most expensive girl.

249
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,786
But well worth it, I assure you.

250
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,585
Too old.

251
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,386
Do you have what I want or not?

252
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:11,140
Of course. Of course.

253
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,606
These fresh?

254
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,321
Come on, the lads are hungry.

255
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:32,119
Nothing better for your cockstand
than fresh oysters.

256
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,415
Guard 1: Here. Thank you.
Guard 2: I'll have one.

257
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,167
Any vinegar?

258
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,045
Who let this girl in? Shoo! Shoo!

259
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,943
Good.

260
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,120
I'll tell you when we're done.

261
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,878
You'll have a fresh one for me tomorrow?

262
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,172
Of course.

263
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,512
Madame: I'll have you whipped, girl.

264
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,847
Go, go on. Out, out, go.

265
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,695
Valar morghulis.

266
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,738
Valar morghulis.

267
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,547
And?

268
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,299
The thin man wasn't hungry today.

269
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,510
Perhaps that is why a man is thin.

270
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,722
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

271
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,518
A girl has work to do.

272
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,117
Your rebellion is over.

273
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,163
You can swear your allegiance to me now,

274
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,583
or you can die.

275
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,079
I believe in second chances.

276
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,792
I don't believe in third chances.

277
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,197
You write like a seven-year-old.

278
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,992
Your maester kindly agreed
to copy it over for me.

279
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:01,328
- He didn't try to make you pay?
- Mmm-mmm.

280
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,540
Maybe he's changed.

281
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,127
The queen will be thrilled to know
you're bringing her daughter home.

282
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,211
She will.

283
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:13,590
- You love her very much, don't you?
- Of course, she's my niece.

284
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,009
I wasn't talking about her.

285
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,180
You think I disapprove?

286
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,810
Because people disapprove
of that sort of thing where you are from?

287
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,980
They disapproved of oberyn and me
where you are from.

288
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:31,650
Here, no one blinked an eye.

289
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:36,905
100 years ago,
no one would have blinked an eye at you

290
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,615
if you'd been named Targaryen.

291
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,785
It's always changing,

292
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:44,746
who we're supposed to love
and who we're not.

293
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:50,002
The only thing that stays the same
is that we want who we want.

294
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,049
I know your daughter had no part
in the terrible thing

295
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,142
that happened to the man I love.

296
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,355
Perhaps even you are innocent of that.

297
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,792
Father.

298
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:35,589
Aren't you cold?

299
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,010
No. What are you reading?

300
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,554
The dance of dragons.

301
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:43,889
What's it about?

302
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,224
It's the story of the fight

303
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,368
between rhaenyra Targaryen
and her half-brother aegon

304
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,603
for control of the seven kingdoms.

305
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,481
Both of them thought
they belonged on the iron throne.

306
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,734
When people started declaring
for one of them or the other,

307
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,819
their fight divided the kingdoms in two.

308
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:01,323
Brothers fought brothers,
dragons fought dragons.

309
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:07,079
By the time it was over,
thousands were dead.

310
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,915
And it was a disaster
for the targaryens as well.

311
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,709
They never truly recovered.

312
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:14,836
The dance of dragons.

313
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,757
Why is that a dance?

314
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,676
It's just what they call it.

315
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,344
Hmm. Doesn't make much sense.

316
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,304
I think it's poetic.

317
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,855
If you'd had to choose

318
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:37,067
between rhaenyra and aegon,

319
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,237
who would you have chosen?

320
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,282
I wouldn't have chosen either.

321
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,951
It's all the choosing sides
that made everything so horrible.

322
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,287
Sometimes a person has to choose.

323
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:53,625
Sometimes the world forces his hand.

324
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:58,463
If a man knows what he is

325
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,718
and remains true to himself,

326
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,432
the choice is no choice at all.

327
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:11,476
He must fulfill his destiny

328
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,149
and become who he is meant to be.

329
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:21,737
However much he may hate it.

330
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,948
It's all right.

331
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,827
You don't even know what I'm talking about.

332
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,830
It doesn't matter. I want to help you.

333
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,458
Is there any way I can help?

334
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,800
Yes, there is.

335
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,594
Good. I want to.

336
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,766
I'm the Princess shireen
of house Baratheon.

337
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,934
And I'm your daughter.

338
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,201
Forgive me.

339
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,828
Where's my father? I want to see my father.

340
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,872
It will all be over soon.

341
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,169
No.

342
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:06,091
Where's my father?

343
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,635
No, you can't do this.
Father, where are you?

344
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,096
Please, let me see my father.

345
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,057
Father, where are
you? Don't let her do this.

346
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,394
Please let go!

347
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:21,148
Let me see my father!
Where are you? Please!

348
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,665
- Selyse: It's what the lord wants.
- No.

349
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,736
- Please! Let go! No!
- It's a good thing.

350
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,822
- A great thing.
- Shireen: Stop!

351
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,949
- Please!
- Melisandre: Hear us now, my lord.

352
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,761
Shireen: You can't do this! Melisandre:
For you, we offer up this girl...

353
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,204
- Please!
- That you may cleanse her with your fire

354
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,248
and that its light may lead our way.

355
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,417
Shireen: No, please let me see my father.

356
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,295
If we don't act, we'll
all starve here. All of us.

357
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,214
But if we make this sacrifice...

358
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:51,386
Accept this token of our faith, my lord,
and lead us from the darkness.

359
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,638
Lord of light, show us the way.

360
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,557
Mother, please!

361
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,103
Mother, please!

362
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:01,855
- Mother!
- We can't.

363
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,333
- There's no other way. She has king's blood.
- Please don't do this!

364
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,335
- Please don't!
- Melisandre: Lord of light, protect us.

365
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:10,280
- Father, please!
- For the night is dark and full of terrors.

366
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:13,867
Father, don't do this! Please!

367
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,329
Mother, no! Please, help!

368
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,748
Don't do this!

369
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,542
Please, father! Mother, help!

370
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:25,712
- No.
- No, please! Don't do this!

371
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:29,174
Don't do this, please, mother!

372
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:33,094
Please, mother! Help!

373
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,055
Mother, help!

374
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:39,809
Please don't do this, mother!

375
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:42,020
Please, mother!

376
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,105
Please! No!

377
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:47,192
Please! No!

378
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,264
Where have you been?

379
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,558
Just making sure everything is in order.

380
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:25,040
Free citizens of meereen!

381
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:29,336
By the blessings of the graces,

382
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,130
and her majesty the queen,

383
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:33,965
welcome

384
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,468
to the great games!

385
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:58,615
My queen, our first contest.

386
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,534
Who will triumph:

387
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,411
The strong,

388
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,288
or the quick?

389
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:11,086
I fight and die for your glory,

390
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,838
oh glorious queen.

391
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:18,718
I fight and die for your glory,

392
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,887
oh glorious queen.

393
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,274
They're waiting for you.

394
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,778
Clap your hands.

395
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:07,892
That one, the smaller man.

396
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,578
No question,
that's where you should put your money.

397
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,895
The smaller man it is.

398
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,856
I'm not putting my money anywhere.

399
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,066
Kings and queens never bet on the games.

400
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,652
Perhaps you should
go find someone who does.

401
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,572
People used to bet against me
when I fought in the pits.

402
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,408
He would have bet against me.
Common novice mistake.

403
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,410
I've spent much of my life in this arena.

404
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:29,956
And in my experience, large men do triumph
over smaller men far more often than not.

405
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,876
Has your experience
ever involved any actual fighting?

406
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,586
You yourself?

407
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,422
Have you ever tried to kill another man
who was trying to kill you?

408
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,594
Whenever I got into the pit
against a beast like that one,

409
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,305
the crowd saw me,
all skin and bone back then,

410
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,349
then they saw a pile of angry muscles
ready to murder me.

411
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,727
They couldn't get
their money out fast enough.

412
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:54,230
But the pile of angry muscles
never had any muscles here

413
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,775
or here.

414
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,444
And the big men were always too slow

415
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:02,322
to stop my dagger
from going where their muscles weren't.

416
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:06,159
Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one
standing across from me

417
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:10,413
making his beast faces,
I knew I could rest easy.

418
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,885
You don't approve?

419
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,930
There's always been more than enough death
in the world for my taste.

420
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,974
- I can do without it in my leisure time.
- Fair enough.

421
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,601
Yet it's an unpleasant question,

422
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:35,814
but what great thing has ever been
accomplished without killing or cruelty?

423
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:39,275
It's easy to confuse
what is with what ought to be,

424
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,195
especially when what is
has worked out in your favor.

425
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,822
I'm not talking about myself.

426
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:46,241
I'm talking about
the necessary conditions for greatness.

427
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,451
That is greatness?

428
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:52,747
That is a vital part
of the great city of meereen,

429
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,749
which existed long before you or I

430
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:59,087
and will remain standing
long after we have returned to the dirt.

431
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,089
My father would have liked you.

432
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:13,017
We ask again: Who will triumph?

433
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,520
One day your great city
will return to the dirt as well.

434
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,730
- At your command?
- If need be.

435
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:20,650
A meereenese champion?

436
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,531
And how many people will die
to make this happen?

437
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,701
If it comes to that,
they will have died for a good reason.

438
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,911
Those men think
they're dying for a good reason.

439
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,621
Daenerys: Someone else's reason.

440
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,332
So your reasons are
true and theirs are false?

441
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,293
They don't know their own minds,
but you do?

442
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:41,963
Well said. You're an eloquent man.

443
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,798
Doesn't mean you're wrong.

444
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:47,302
In my experience, eloquent men are right
every bit as often as imbeciles.

445
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,971
Or a westerosi knight?

446
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,474
I fight and die for your glory,

447
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,897
oh glorious queen.

448
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,790
- Your grace...
- Shut your mouth.

449
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,272
- You can end this.
- She cannot.

450
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,024
You can.

451
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,958
Protect your queen!

452
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,413
Your grace!

453
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:10,041
Come with me. I know a way out.
I know a way...

454
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,161
Stay close.

455
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,003
This way.

456
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:10,184
The other side. Follow me.

457
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,106
Protect your queen!

458
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,823
Drogon!

459
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,220
Valahd.
