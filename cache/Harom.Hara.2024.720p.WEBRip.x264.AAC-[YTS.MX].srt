1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,040
Nandu!

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,480
Why are you standing in front
of the hospital and smoking?

Downloaded from

4
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,760
My wife is sick. She is inside.

5
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,440
What happened to her?

6
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,800
The same women's illness.

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Official YIFY movies site:

8
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,960
Women's illness?

9
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,960
The expense...
- How much is the cigarette?

10
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,160
Ten rupees.
- Ten rupees?

11
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,720
And how many are in your pocket?

12
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,200
There's one more.
- You have money to die.

13
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,280
But not to save
your wife from death.

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,560
What are you saying?

15
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,400
Look at this. It says death on it.

16
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,080
And this sanitary pad is life.

17
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,360
Don't laugh.

18
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,920
With the price of two cigarettes.

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,600
You can save your wife from
such a dangerous disease.

20
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,680
Which can be caused by using dirty
clothes during periods.

21
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,440
And by not smoking cigarette.

22
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,960
You can protect yourself
from fatal diseases.

23
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,120
It means with instead of buying
death you can protect two lives.

24
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,160
Yours and your wife's.

25
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,040
Think it over and laugh.

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,800
Heroism doesn't like in smoking.

27
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,520
But in giving this.

28
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,360
Smoking causes cancer
and takes lives.

29
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,080
Consumption of liquor is injurious
to health.

30
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,240
HC-0382. Palani Swami, Head constable
from Kuppam police station.

31
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,040
You are here as a suspect.

32
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,560
Don't you feel ashamed
to be sitting here?

33
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,240
Palani, I don't have patience.

34
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,480
I need answers.

35
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,200
I need it too, ma'am.

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,880
You have arrested a man, who is
worshipped by all the villagers.

37
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,640
You will have to tell us where
Subramanium is. - What did you say?

38
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,680
Should I tell you?
Should I tell you?

39
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,960
You commit crimes.

40
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,480
Influence the law.

41
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,440
Erase the evidence.

42
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,520
And even stop the FIRs.

43
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,440
You earn money illegally
and claim to be a God.

44
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,640
He is not worth being called
a human.

45
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,640
Just the villagers call him God,
will he become a God?

46
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,760
Madam, shall I tell you something?

47
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,840
None of the villagers engaged
in farming are in any debts.

48
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,320
Those who migrated
to other villages for jobs,

49
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,120
are now living happily
in their own village.

50
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,360
This was all done by Subramanium,
but no one says this.

51
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,760
The ones who received help look
at him as God.

52
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,960
People like you who are skeptical
look for wrong in him.

53
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,600
If given a chance to speak,

54
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,280
even a demon like Ravan would claim
that he is a great person.

55
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,560
I don't want stories.
I want the truth.

56
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,480
Okay, madam.

57
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,280
So you want the truth.
If that is the case

58
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,200
then before telling you

59
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,480
the story of Subramanium's elevation
to the status of God

60
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,080
I will tell you about
the real demon of this village.

61
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,360
Listen.

62
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,560
Do you like this place more
than our village?

63
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,440
Then we will stay here.

64
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,240
Where are you from?

65
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,880
You may be
from the neighbouring village

66
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,320
but you can't intrude
into Tamma Reddy's territory.

67
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,880
Tamma Reddy's territory?
Who is Tamma Reddy?

68
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,720
Do you know who I am?
- Kumar from Kolar village.

69
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,680
I bought this place with my money.
Why would I listen to Tamma Reddy?

70
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,560
The land can be registered
under any name,

71
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,920
but the land belongs
to Tamma Reddy only.

72
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,680
This is not your Kolar,
where you can act as per your wish.

73
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,240
This is Kuppam.

74
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,080
The MLA of Kuppam is also my guy.

75
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,720
In front of my range

76
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,240
your Tamma Reddy won't last long.
Go and tell him.

77
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,640
Look! I swear by this sugarcane.

78
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,320
I am witnessing someone opposing
Tamma Reddy for the first time.

79
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,840
Good.

80
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,680
You too come along with your Tamma
Reddy, I will serve you mutton.

81
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,560
Dear, make curry for me.

82
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,280
Sure. So be it.

83
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,800
If this continues, will your son
become the MLA the next time?

84
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,920
What do I do? I am getting old.
He has to take the responsibility.

85
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,680
Anyhow, no one can oppose you
in this town, right?

86
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,080
Venkateshwar, not just here, you have
to give respect outside as well.

87
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,760
Only then will your life be safe.
Am I right?

88
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,440
How are you brother Tamma Reddy?
How come you are here?

89
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,960
Venkatesh, didn't you teach
your son wisdom and caution?

90
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,680
He publicly claims
to be the next MLA.

91
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,880
If your son becomes the MLA,
will my son work under him?

92
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,440
Sir,

93
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,320
I swear on my mother

94
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,760
I didn't know that your son
is entering into politics.

95
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,880
Please spare my son.
You will be doing a virtue.

96
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,960
I don't believe in virtue and sin.
Understood, MLA?

97
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,840
Keep your son within limits,
otherwise...

98
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,120
It won't happen, sir.

99
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,480
Why would anyone oppose
brother Sharad?

100
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,440
Leave!

101
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,600
Can you please taste this food?

102
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,960
Hey!

103
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,400
The chili is fine but
the spices are a tad bit strong.

104
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,240
Vishwa, you see.

105
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,200
He called me here in his ignorance.

106
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,960
When you had to kill him here,
why did you bring me here?

107
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,680
He boasted with attitude saying,
MLA was going to come.

108
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,480
He said it is his range.

109
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,840
That's why I wanted
to show him our range.

110
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,120
Moreover,
I need a woman to spend the night.

111
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,320
I thought why not sleep
with his wife.

112
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,400
First I will settle his score,
and then I will look after her.

113
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,040
Hey!
How many times should I teach you?

114
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,640
Blood won't ooze out properly if you
stab there. Stab a little up.

115
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,680
Get lost!

116
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,520
Now look how
his blood is oozing out.

117
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,760
Hey, burn it down.

118
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
No!

119
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,840
If Vishwas Reddy sees a woman

120
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,280
and the land Tamma Reddy steps on,
they take them by force.

121
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,680
In spite of owning the land,

122
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,840
these silent residents were beaten,
even on the festival day.

123
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,840
So they couldn't endure it.

124
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,520
The villagers were migrating out

125
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,240
of the village
when lives became unbearable.

126
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,200
Then one man came to stay
in that village.

127
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,000
He is Subramanium.

128
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,880
"Your power strengthens the weak."

129
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,280
"Your devotion strengthens
the meek."

130
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,280
"The end is near for the tyrants."

131
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,920
"Your devotees revere you."

132
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,440
"Hail Shiv Shambu!
You are merciless on the evil."

133
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,480
"You annihilate the enemies
and bring a new dawn."

134
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,960
"You are the auspicious God! O Gauri
Shankar, the enchanting one!"

135
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:44,120
"You are the ascetic.
You wipe the evil."

136
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,920
"You are the beginning and the end."

137
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,360
"O God, bless us with your grace."

138
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,560
"Be fearless! If you have
confidence, you will be invincible."

139
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,120
"May the torch
of truth always stay lit."

140
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,440
Hail Harom Hara! Hail Harom Hara!

141
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,320
All you do is pray.
Get me a cup of tea.

142
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,680
Why are you in such a hurry?

143
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,680
Neither Subramanium needs to go
to college nor you have a duty.

144
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,120
So why are you in such a hurry?

145
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,560
Ramanna, I am not fired.
I am only under suspension.

146
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,720
Once I become a police officer,
it won't be so easy to fire me.

147
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,120
You know,
I didn't do anything wrong.

148
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,280
I will get my job back
after the enquiry.

149
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,960
Yes, please take it.
- Understood?

150
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,280
Nobody respects a man without a job.
Did you see that, Subramanium?

151
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,720
"Hail Harom Hara!
This is your world."

152
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,640
"Hail Harom Hara!
Spread peace and prosperity."

153
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,600
"Hail Harom Hara!
Your arrival is auspicious."

154
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,320
"Hail Harom Hara!
Your wrath is fierce."

155
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,440
What's this? What if somebody sees?

156
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,640
So what?

157
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,280
You are a teacher and I am a lab
assistant. It won't look good.

158
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,080
So what? It's okay. Have it.

159
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,560
Okay, you leave.

160
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,640
Hello, Subramanium!
- Yes, dad. How are you?

161
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,160
Yes, I am fine.
But why didn't you come home?

162
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,000
Hey, get him into the vehicle.

163
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,200
Don't worry about that.
I will send you the money order.

164
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,240
Okay, son. I will hang up.

165
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,960
Brother, they publish everything
in the newspaper.

166
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,800
Why doesn't anybody report the
atrocities happening in our village?

167
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,560
Nothing was published
since I joined the duty.

168
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,080
How can you expect it now?

169
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,200
What happened?

170
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,440
You be quiet. This is normal here.

171
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,480
Make ginger tea.
- Yes.

172
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,120
Sit.

173
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,520
Why didn't you come by bus directly?

174
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,960
Do you have
any problem picking me up?

175
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,440
I didn't mean that.
But what if somebody sees us?

176
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,640
Being a girl, I am showing courage.

177
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,720
You are a man,
what are you scared of?

178
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,840
I am not scared.

179
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,280
Anyway, we don't have
to tell everything to you girls.

180
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,840
Look. Let me earn some money.

181
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,880
Once I save enough

182
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,360
then I will take you on
a drive in my car.

183
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,680
Here.

184
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,640
Okay. You leave,
I will get ready and come.

185
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,080
Brother. Brother, save me.

186
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,480
They are coming to kill me.
- What happened?

187
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,880
That guy chasing me
misbehaved with my sister.

188
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,800
I confronted him.
So he started beating me.

189
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,120
Hey, wait!

190
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,760
Listen. I will talk to the Principal
if you have any concerns.

191
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,080
What else will you do? Hit me?

192
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,120
What are you looking at?

193
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,800
Tell me. Come!

194
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,640
Brother, he is Sharad Reddy's guy.

195
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,080
Subramanium!

196
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,000
Despite kg who we are,
how dare you this!

197
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,240
Now get ready to face
the consequences.

198
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,120
Come on, let's go.

199
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,320
Brother Sharad.

200
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,640
What happened?

201
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,520
Somebody from the polytechnical
college dared to lay hands on us.

202
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,520
Hey! Start the car.

203
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,440
Hey, Sharad.

204
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,600
Listen. Wait outside.

205
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,640
Where are you going?

206
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,120
Didn't you hear it?
I will see who he is.

207
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,600
Are you out of your mind?

208
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,720
Will you get into their fights?

209
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,440
Are they working for you
or are you working for them?

210
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,160
Subramanium, don't you have a sense
of whom you are dealing with?

211
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,520
They can even close down this
college. Is this what you want?

212
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,520
Hello.
- Hey, I am Sharad speaking.

213
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,440
Sir, please forgive us.
It was a mistake.

214
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,960
How dare he! Who is he?

215
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,600
Don't you know what will happen
if I come there?

216
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,520
Sir, I promise this won't be
repeated. I beg your forgiveness.

217
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,520
He is not from this village. That's
why he doesn't know about you.

218
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,880
If he continues to work
at your college

219
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,880
I will make sure you no longer have
a college. Understood?

220
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,680
Okay, sir.

221
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,960
I knew this was coming.

222
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,600
While staying in this village,
I can't go against their word.

223
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,160
If you want to continue working
in this college,

224
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,000
you have to beg for
their forgiveness.

225
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,880
Or you should resign from your job.

226
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,960
Sir, I can't live like this.

227
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,360
I don't want a life where I have
to live on others' terms.

228
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,880
I will take your leave, sir.

229
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,200
Okay, leave. You don't need
this college, as per your range.

230
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,040
We can get a much better job
than this. I mean it.

231
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,200
Hey! Did you see it?
They are such rogues.

232
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,280
I hope somebody would
straighten them out.

233
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,760
Hey, Subramanium!

234
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,160
Subramanium, phone call for you.

235
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,800
Hello, Subramanium!

236
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,960
Yes, dad.

237
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,960
You haven't sent
the money this week.

238
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,760
Son, please try to send some money.

239
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,440
Are you there? Hello?

240
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,600
I will not send money order,
but come in person this time.

241
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,160
Okay then. Please come. Come fast.

242
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,440
I will take your leave.
- Okay.

243
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,120
My son is here, I am leaving.
- Okay. Take care.

244
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,840
Son, I thought you would come
in the evening.

245
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,840
Actually, I took a leave.

246
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,120
Okay.

247
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,920
Here's the key. Go home.

248
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,200
I have some urgent work.
I will come later.

249
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,360
Give me the money.

250
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,480
What's the hurry?

251
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,880
I have work.

252
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,640
Give it.

253
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,920
Don't lie there drunk.
Come home soon.

254
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,560
Don't make fun of me. Should
I bring chicken for you. - Yes.

255
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,680
The weather department
has forecast rain.

256
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,120
You don't pay my money.

257
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,160
Don't throw my stuff.
- Throw it outside.

258
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,840
Try to understand.
My son is here. Listen.

259
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,600
Brother, my son is inside.

260
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,880
When will you give me money?

261
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,320
Listen. Please leave.
- Won't you return our money?

262
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,080
Hey! - When will you repay us?
Return the money!

263
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,320
What is it?

264
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,080
Why are you troubling my father?
What happened?

265
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,200
Your father took loan. - If he can't
repay, why did he take a loan?

266
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,160
Listen. Please calm down
and tell me what happened.

267
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,840
Tell him he has borrowed money.
Are you scared?

268
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,360
Ask him where our money is.

269
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,080
Yes, tell us! Where is our money?

270
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,800
Answer us.
He has swindled our money. - Wait.

271
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,920
He is an educated guy.
He will talk sensibly.

272
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,840
Subramanium, your father has
borrowed money from all of us.

273
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,320
Even after many years

274
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,800
he hasn't even paid interest
or the principal amount.

275
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,120
When we demand money,

276
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,160
he keeps telling us that
you will pay off his loan.

277
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,760
But so far he hasn't given
a penny to any of us.

278
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,960
You solve our problem.

279
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,840
Okay, fine.
How much does he owe you?

280
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,120
He owes me 28,800 rupees.

281
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,040
Listen. Give me some time,
I will return all your money.

282
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,080
Should we trust us. Earlier

283
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,880
we gave time to your father,
now you want time.

284
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,840
It is not so, brother.

285
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,120
But I need some time
to gather this huge amount.

286
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,240
We can't give any more time. We have
waited for too long already.

287
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,880
Wait. Everyone, silent. Let me talk.

288
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,640
Look, Subramanium!

289
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,000
We should give you more time

290
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,160
but the villagers have lost faith
in your father.

291
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,200
We can give you 3 months' time.

292
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,680
Return our money within
three months.

293
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,640
I will repay your money within
this time. Okay?

294
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,680
How can we trust them? - How long
should we wait for our money?

295
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,800
You too say something.

296
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,760
Quiet! He has promised
to return within 3 months.

297
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,160
Let's leave for now.
- Let's go.

298
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,880
It's too much!

299
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,840
We have to leave empty-handed.

300
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,040
Hmm. Have it.

301
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,920
You may think I am talking
in intoxication.

302
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,160
Son, people respect only
those who have money.

303
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,480
You should not face this
in the future

304
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,560
that's why I am telling you
to earn a lot of money.

305
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,960
Because I am going through
an ordeal.

306
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,880
Only I know how I face
this humiliation.

307
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,840
You tell the same thing every
time you are drunk.

308
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,120
Continue!

309
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,520
Do not worry about
what happened today.

310
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,160
Anyhow,

311
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,560
I will manage to clear my debts.

312
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,640
How will you get the money?

313
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,440
There's no need.
I will manage something.

314
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,480
I forbid you.

315
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,840
We won't always live like this.

316
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,920
We will see good days too.

317
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:11,120
I will clear all my debts and get
you married to a good girl.

318
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,800
Will you be quiet?

319
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,480
You are talking about my wedding.

320
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,040
I didn't want to tell you
but you are forcing me.

321
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,960
I lost my job.

322
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,920
How will I get money the next month?

323
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,680
I am not refusing.

324
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,520
I said I will take care of it. Okay?

325
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,800
Please finish your dinner! Son!

326
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,680
Subramanium!

327
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,280
I will find peace only if
I share my feelings.

328
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,840
That's why I am sharing my pain
with you after you sleep.

329
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:11,720
Because I don't have anyone else
in this world to share with.

330
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,520
You never asked me anything, son.

331
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,000
Even today, you took the responsibility
of clearing my debts anyhow.

332
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,280
But you never asked me the reason.

333
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,960
You have always been
a good son to me.

334
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:38,600
But I was a useless father to you.

335
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,840
What sins have you done
to have me as your father

336
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,840
and what good deeds have
I done to have you as my son?

337
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,200
Only God knows the answer
and no one else.

338
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,080
Listen. I am not asleep yet.
- Huh?

339
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,560
Are you not asleep?

340
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,440
Sleep. Sleep. Sleep well.

341
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,400
I can't believe that you are so
upset because of losing his job.

342
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,880
Don't lose hope so soon.

343
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,280
Why are you looking at me like this?

344
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,520
What is going on in your mind?

345
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,760
Tell me the truth, Subramanium.

346
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,880
My father has taken huge debts
in my village.

347
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,240
I have been saving money
to start a business of my own

348
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,240
but even my entire savings isn't
enough to clear those debts.

349
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,240
How can you give up like others?

350
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,360
You are not like others.
You are unique.

351
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,840
Do not be dejected.

352
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,960
Don't wreck your brains over this.

353
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,000
Take this.

354
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,720
Why would you do that?

355
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,440
Don't you know why I did that?
You said you need money, right?

356
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,960
Either sell them or pawn them.
Your wish. Okay?

357
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,360
But you should not be sad.

358
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,560
I can't see you like this.

359
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,400
I don't want this.

360
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,440
I will find a way.

361
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,320
Listen to me!
- Keep it.

362
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,720
Subramanium! Hey, Subramanium!

363
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,600
It seems Palani is here.

364
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,640
Brother, what happened?
- My team member has passed away.

365
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,680
I need to attend his cremation.
Can you drop me?

366
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,000
Okay. I will get the key.
- Okay.

367
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,880
Palani has some work.
- Hmm.

368
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,400
You may leave.

369
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,080
Hey, Subramanium!

370
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,400
I will come back. You stay here.
- Okay.

371
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,080
It was terrible!

372
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,440
What will happen now?
- Yes, it is terrible.

373
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,600
He was a great man.

374
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,360
He always gave money
to the needy people

375
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,320
even when we didn't ask for it.

376
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,480
Thank you.

377
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,600
So, Palani!

378
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,120
When did you come?

379
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,280
Just now, sir.
- Okay.

380
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,000
I got some booze from the village.
Let's drink together.

381
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,760
I don't feel like drinking now, sir.

382
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,120
What is it? How can you reject
an offer of liquor!

383
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,160
No matter what,
he was your colleague.

384
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,600
I know you must be in pain.
Come and have a drink.

385
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,600
My friend is there.
I will send him and join you.

386
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,320
Okay, come there later.
- Sure.

387
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,040
Subramanium, keep this bag with you.

388
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,480
I will take it from you later.
Okay? You may leave.

389
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,800
Go quickly.

390
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,760
Where is the bag, Subramanium?

391
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,400
Nobody saw it, right?

392
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,880
No.

393
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,880
But why are you so tensed?

394
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,560
Didn't you see what's in it?

395
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,200
I saw.

396
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,320
You saw it, right?

397
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,600
If my department finds this out,
all hell will break loose.

398
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,400
This is the cause of my suspension.

399
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,400
I understand the gun,
what about the blueprint?

400
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,440
Four months ago...

401
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,520
All our problems will be solved
with it.

402
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,480
What if our sir finds out?

403
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,720
How will he find out if
we don't tell him?

404
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,880
Listen.
I have traced a party in a village.

405
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,400
I will get him to make
an exact replica of this.

406
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,960
We will replace
the replica over here.

407
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,800
Not only will we make profits
but also retain our duty.

408
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,000
What do you say?
- Okay.

409
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,720
Unfortunately,
there was an inspection that day.

410
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,880
The evidence went missing
and I was on duty that day.

411
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,680
So I was suspended.

412
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,720
Okay, fine.

413
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,960
But why do you keep it
with yourself?

414
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,440
Why don't you give it to that party?

415
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,440
How can I?

416
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,840
He has been arrested by
the police there.

417
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,400
Had I sold it to him,
I would have got 500 rupees.

418
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,000
What did you say?

419
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,640
500 rupees for this gun?

420
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,920
What else do you think?

421
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,440
If it takes 50 rupees for the metal
and 20 rupees for the making

422
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,680
still it should not cost more
than 100.

423
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,000
You are right. But who will make it?

424
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,080
People around
the world use gun for power.

425
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,200
But this gun has traveled
all around to get to me.

426
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,680
It's trying to tell me something.
The heart is sending a message.

427
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,280
Let's make a business out of this.

428
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,240
Huh? Are you being serious?

429
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,920
Why would I lie about this?

430
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,680
We both need money. You tell me.

431
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,320
Do you have a better idea than this?

432
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,760
Subramanium, look.

433
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,160
Only dangerous people get
into such business.

434
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,600
If we start this business, can we
survive while competing with them?

435
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,240
Brother,
we can manage to live somehow.

436
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,800
Even a lion gets caught by
the hunter if it gets scared.

437
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,800
It can be the king of the Jungle
only if it scares others.

438
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,480
Let's start with it.
We will deal with it later.

439
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,400
Look!
Even God gave a green signal to us.

440
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,120
They ring the bell every day
at this time in the temple.

441
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,640
How is that related to our business?

442
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,000
Look. Let's make a start.

443
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,800
We will stop if we feel it is wrong.

444
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,160
But if everything goes well,

445
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,880
we believe that
God is making us do it.

446
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,560
Tell me now!

447
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,160
Look.

448
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,960
I will come to you during
the business time,

449
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,280
but the liability falls entirely
on you.

450
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,160
I don't have any money to invest.
I am making this very clear to you.

451
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,200
What happened, Subramanium?
Why are you quiet?

452
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,480
Will you say something?

453
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,600
There is nothing to talk about.

454
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,240
Let's get into action.

455
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,440
Come on.
- Where are we going?

456
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,720
Let's find a good place
to start this business.

457
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,560
This place looks good,
Subramanium. Nobody stays here.

458
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,320
There's a school right beside it.
How can we do it here?

459
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,160
Look. How about this?

460
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,760
It will crumble with the sound
of the bullets.

461
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,960
I remembered a great place.
- Then show it to me.

462
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,840
Subramanium, stop here.

463
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,120
Brother.

464
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,960
How about we use this talkies?

465
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,280
Do you know who owns this talkies?

466
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,160
Let's go.

467
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,560
Why do we care who owns it?

468
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,960
It has been closed since the day
I came to this village.

469
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,640
It looks like no one comes here.

470
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,360
It's confirmed that
no one comes here.

471
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,160
The power supply is active,
but the bulb is not working.

472
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,040
They seem to be very poor.
Even the projector is not working.

473
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,560
Come on!

474
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,640
Hey, you! Will you act pompous?

475
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,800
Will you act pompous with me?

476
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,400
Beat him! Beat him!

477
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,240
Sharad Reddy is here.

478
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,640
We killed
your brother-in-law Kolar Kumar.

479
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,040
Do you think you are
a bigger Don than him?

480
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,560
I will teach you a lesson.
- Brother, please forgive me.

481
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,720
Come on!

482
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,240
They have left. Let's leave quickly.

483
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,560
Where, brother?

484
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,400
Where would we get
a better place than this?

485
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,800
We have electricity supply.
The sound doesn't go out.

486
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,080
Since Sharad Reddy visits the place,

487
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,200
no one else would come
to this place.

488
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,720
That's what I am saying.
He keeps coming to this place.

489
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,680
Let them have their petty fights.
Why should we care?

490
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,720
You are not scared despite
witnessing a murder.

491
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,640
You are definitely not a good man.

492
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,880
There's no such thing as good
or bad.

493
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,160
"Better you don't trigger,
before you butter him."

494
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,400
"Just dig your grave before,
you fight him."

495
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,640
"He got spring in the bones.
He is not a metaphor."

496
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,960
"Look at him right in the eye."

497
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,520
"Gun smith.
Gut is just like a loaded barrel."

498
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,720
"Gun smith.
Cutting deep into bloody bones."

499
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,720
"Gun smith."

500
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,400
"He is got a rusty face
and knitting hands."

501
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,080
"You will find him
like a moving gun."

502
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,760
Listen, Ramanna.

503
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,480
Subramanium seems to be having some
tension. Give 2 cups of tea.

504
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,760
Okay, brother.

505
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,160
It shoots in reverse.

506
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,520
And this?

507
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,360
Oh! You did it, kiddo.

508
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,240
I have seen only trash guns
throughout my service.

509
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,960
I haven't seen it as good as
this one so far.

510
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,880
Did you make
the bullets yourself too?

511
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,200
A gun should never be understood.

512
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,440
You should know its power only
after using it.

513
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,120
Mark my words. It will have
good demands in the market.

514
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,320
That's more like it. Now we shall
celebrate Diwali every day.

515
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,120
Listen,
come to Krishnagiri tomorrow.

516
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,560
You got me 60 kilometres away
from Kuppam

517
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,720
saying we have a good client
to do business.

518
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,920
But you are having
a liquor party instead.

519
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,240
Here.

520
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,080
If not him then someone
else will come.

521
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,840
If we have a product to offer,
the buyer will come to us.

522
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,800
Sharad! Why are you so late?

523
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,400
Any problem on the way here?

524
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,400
What do I say, Raj?

525
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,560
I got late because
of a girl's matter.

526
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,280
Leave it. Serve me a drink.

527
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,480
I don't have time. I will leave.

528
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,600
What's the hurry?

529
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,760
Is your step-brother causing
any trouble?

530
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,720
He has joined some other gang,
but there is no problem.

531
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,040
Okay. Let's finish one peg.
I will leave too.

532
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,720
Okay, brother.
I will take your leave.

533
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,640
Okay.

534
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,240
Guys, come on.

535
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,840
Look at what our boss is doing!

536
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,120
Look what he is doing
with boss over there.

537
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,440
Hey!

538
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,200
What's this?

539
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,040
Gun.

540
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,960
I can see that.
Why did you keep it here?

541
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,280
I thought you might need it.

542
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,640
Even the bullets are loaded.
Try it once.

543
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,040
You will get
a good feeling for sure.

544
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,120
I know what you are thinking now.
Take this with you.

545
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,160
Use it for some time.

546
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,840
If you like it talk to
your father and let me know,

547
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,920
how many you want and
where to deliver them.

548
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,520
What do you say?
- What should I say?

549
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,760
Daggers are enough these days.
What would I do with this gun?

550
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,840
Now, no one can save you.

551
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,400
This fight is between us.

552
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,680
You can show off your power
in your village.

553
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,880
How dare you!

554
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,160
Hey! Stop!

555
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,960
Hey! He has a gun!

556
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:37,160
That day the sound from
Subramanium's gun created an echo

557
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,480
in the ears of those gangs.

558
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:43,360
And it instilled fear in their eyes.

559
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,000
Sharad, shall I tell you something?

560
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,000
If you have a knife, only the one
you are about to stab will fear you.

561
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:03,120
But if you have a gun,
everyone around you will fear you.

562
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,080
"Where darkness spreads everywhere"

563
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,680
"he marches to annihilate the evil."

564
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,680
"There is only one slogan coming
from the Kailash."

565
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,400
"He is off to kill the demons."

566
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,560
"This is the time to end sin."

567
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,320
Hey!

568
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,360
Put extra spice in it.

569
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,560
Take this away.

570
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,360
Vishwas!
- Yes.

571
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,320
Sharad has brought something for us.

572
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,320
Instead of checking it out you
are busy with yourself.

573
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,160
We are not used to it.

574
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,640
We should stick with whatever
we are used to.

575
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,160
Yes. You are right.

576
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,400
Sharad, do you think we need this?

577
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:19,320
Do you think you and uncle are
in still young?

578
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,800
I am of marriageable age.

579
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,200
Tomorrow if I have to kill someone,
will I take a dagger?

580
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:30,240
But if we have a gun,
we can shoot him from a distance.

581
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,440
Hey! I can't do it.
- What?

582
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,520
I aimed here and it shot there.

583
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,160
Come on, uncle.

584
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,440
I too didn't know how to use dagger.

585
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,280
I learnt it gradually.
This gun too is similar to that.

586
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,040
You will learn to use it eventually.

587
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,160
It's right.

588
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,720
Now tell me,
how many guns do you want?

589
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,840
We can't just get one each
for the three of us.

590
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:05,640
No! Look around,
how they are staring at us.

591
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,160
Get one for each of them.

592
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,040
What are you doing here?

593
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,840
I will tell.
You said you smoke occasionally.

594
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,400
But now it seems you are
a chain smoker.

595
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,160
It is nothing! I am under a bit
of tension, that's why.

596
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,640
I threw it away.

597
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,240
Look. What are you doing? Stay away.

598
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,960
Oh really?
Don't get any ideas in your brain.

599
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,720
You can't do anything without
my permission. Understood?

600
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,840
Me? Nothing.

601
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,880
Tell me the truth.

602
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,280
What do you want to do?

603
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,080
Before you ask

604
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,680
I wanted to tell you long ago.

605
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,480
I am doing something wrong.

606
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,800
What's that?

607
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,760
I am making guns.

608
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,640
Say it again.
And keep it simple for me.

609
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,640
Guns. Pistols.

610
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,160
Do you want to see?

611
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,760
Here!

612
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,720
Does it go off?

613
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,720
If you load bullets into it,
it will kill too.

614
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,280
Is this the wrong thing
you mentioned about?

615
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,600
Yes.

616
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,080
How is this wrong?

617
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,440
What are you saying?
Isn't making guns wrong?

618
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,600
No. How can it be wrong?

619
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:45,680
All these years, have we ever got
more money that our basic needs?

620
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,400
No, right?

621
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,640
Anything that we do
for our survival is not wrong.

622
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,800
In these times, if we are nice,
society makes our lives miserable.

623
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,840
We have to be cunning
to lead a decent life.

624
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,760
Why are you talking like this?

625
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:58,800
What else did you expect then?

626
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,400
Oh God, we don't need all this.

627
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,360
It doesn't matter if
we don't have enough food.

628
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,600
We will manage in meager food.

629
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,280
Do you want me to say
such ridiculous things?

630
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,280
Drop me off at the college.
I am getting late.

631
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,800
Won't you drink it?

632
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:24,080
I don't drink while on business.

633
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,520
While I am drinking,
I don't talk about business.

634
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,040
He is like that only.
Come to the point.

635
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,520
My father has two wives.

636
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,000
His second wife has a son.

637
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,600
By joining hands with Mahendar,
he is getting too arrogant.

638
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,240
My gang is not secure enough,
at the moment.

639
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,400
My life is in danger too.

640
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,280
I need guns immediately.

641
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,240
Is that all?

642
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,640
I will give them.
When do you want them?

643
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,760
Do you know what kind
of a person he is?

644
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,560
It's not easy to get guns in
my area, escaping his watch.

645
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:16,080
If his gang finds out that
I have approached you for guns,

646
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:21,400
he will go to any extent to stop me
and show his power.

647
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,760
That's why I am warning you.

648
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:26,320
It will be difficult to come here
avoiding my step brother. - Look!

649
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,440
Rajmanikyam.

650
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,440
Rajmanik.

651
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,640
As I said, I do a lot of stuff.

652
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,040
If I commit to something,
I get it done by hook or crook.

653
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,080
You will receive your goods.
You just have a good time.

654
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,600
I will take care of the rest.

655
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,360
Hey! Search all the vehicles.
- Okay, sir.

656
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,200
Look there. Check that van.

657
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,600
They are checking because they have
received some information.

658
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:36,960
Rajamanikyam said that
someone has tipped them off.

659
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,360
Sir, we found nothing.

660
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:51,840
You may leave.

661
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,600
Police increased the surveillance.

662
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,640
I got a phone call.
I feared you would be caught.

663
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,680
By the way, where are the goods?

664
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,680
They are here

665
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,960
but first get those steel utensils.

666
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,120
Those utensils?

667
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,880
Rajamanikyam sent these.

668
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,480
This time our boss will be get

669
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,320
the election ticket.
No one can stop us.

670
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,720
Drive slowly.
Subramanium is sitting there.

671
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,360
Palani! Palani!

672
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,760
You started the story with the
promise of revealing the monster.

673
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,080
But you are telling me how
Subramanium turned into a monster.

674
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,400
I don't see Subramanium's virtues.

675
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,480
I see only his crimes.

676
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,720
Madam, I am telling you
the truth that you asked for.

677
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,800
If I had to tell only good things
about Subramanium,

678
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,200
I would have skipped half the story.

679
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,720
You would have found
the rest yourself.

680
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,360
We did business,
that's it. Not murders.

681
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,720
When
we felt everything was going well

682
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,120
Tamma Reddy and his men were causing
ruckus in the opposition.

683
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,760
Leave me!

684
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,920
We lost the case, Tamma Reddy.

685
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,160
Didn't I tell you that
I am going out

686
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,120
and get bathed before I come back?

687
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,320
I was feeling feverish.

688
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,720
Never mind.

689
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:38,160
Put on some powder at least.
You will look good.

690
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,800
Hey, Vishwas!

691
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,640
Yes, brother?

692
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:49,080
We lost the case.
Rajendra just informed me.

693
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,960
I will see that scoundrel lawyer.

694
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,040
Hey.

695
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,400
Singaru!
- Yes, sir!

696
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,040
Search that rascal. Where is he?

697
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:04,040
I want him with the lawyer
in the talkies by tonight.

698
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:04,960
Okay, sir.

699
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:23,520
Had you shown this brilliance
in the court,

700
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,960
you would have been alive today.

701
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,000
Drat!

702
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,720
The world is too small, madam.

703
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,120
An incident that happens afar
to a person,

704
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,880
affects some other person
who is not related to him.

705
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,200
But we were in the same village.

706
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,240
So how couldn't our matters
affect each other?

707
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,800
You fool!

708
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,480
Brother, leave me.

709
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:57,800
Do you think gun trading is easy?

710
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,560
I made a mistake!

711
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,120
You said it, didn't you?

712
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,880
Now go to hell.

713
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,320
Subramanium!

714
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,920
Things have heated up.
That Mahendra...

715
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,280
Rajamanikyam.

716
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,640
You are free to make
a gang against your brother,

717
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,000
that's your personal matter.

718
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,360
But I cannot accept that
you have brought guns

719
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,000
from someone else other than me.

720
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,800
Did you think I had not notice?

721
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,040
Or did you think I would be quiet
after find out?

722
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,520
Did you supply guns to me when
I needed them? So what do I do?

723
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,280
Have your tea and vacate the place.

724
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,840
Do you think you can do business
while going against me?

725
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,920
Don't you know I have whose support?

726
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,480
I don't care.

727
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,720
This is my village.
And I am the Don here.

728
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,160
That Mahendra has targeted us.

729
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,920
He may attack them any time.

730
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,480
What should we do now, kiddo?

731
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,000
The guns must reach our men
before Mahendra attacks.

732
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,480
Deliver them tonight.

733
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,080
Should I tell our men anything?

734
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,800
There's nothing to be said now.

735
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,080
Let's get into action.

736
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,560
Why are we sending all the guns?

737
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:37,480
Will they keep a count
when lives are lost there.

738
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,160
It's better if you could deliver
this personally.

739
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:31,120
After delivering goods once,
you are back here again.

740
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,080
Have you two lost your mind?

741
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,160
Aren't you scared?

742
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,480
If you have to continue
your business,

743
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,600
you must work under us and fear us.

744
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:42,800
My boss won't agree
to work under you.

745
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,440
Moreover,
he does not know what fear is.

746
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,480
Selva, did you see it?

747
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,200
Subramanium should fear us.

748
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:55,520
Get him into the vehicle.

749
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,360
If anything comes to us
after intimation, it's fear.

750
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,120
If it comes without our knowledge,
it's a danger.

751
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,760
If it all comes at once,
it's a bad time.

752
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,560
After that along
with Subramanium's life,

753
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,160
my life also took a drastic turn.

754
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,560
Hey, come in!

755
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:40,920
Come.

756
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,160
Come. Come.

757
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,960
How dare you go against boss!
Take this.

758
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,680
Come fast!

759
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:09,160
Hey, Singaru. Why did you take
so long to get this old man?

760
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:12,440
Hey! Be quiet. It was not
an easy task to bring him.

761
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:16,360
Hey, why are you talking
to the one we want to kill?

762
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,960
He has a son, boss.

763
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,600
Our men were searching for him.

764
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,080
I thought that
we would kill both at once.

765
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:24,360
We will kill him when he comes
for his cremation.

766
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,920
Kill him now.

767
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,000
Okay, boss.

768
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:37,680
See who is there.
- Okay, boss.

769
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,520
Boss, it was a peacock.

770
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,560
Kill it after you kill him.

771
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,760
I will have it for dinner
with liquor.

772
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:28,720
Son!

773
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,360
Hey! Go!

774
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:51,200
Hey! Call our men quickly. Come on!

775
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,040
Hey, boss. Kittappa.

776
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:22,960
Go.

777
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,960
Look, Mahendra.

778
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:39,000
Tell the ones over there that
there's a lion on this side.

779
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:43,160
His name is Subramanium Care
of Kuppam.

780
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:19,280
I have never questioned
any of your actions.

781
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:24,560
But yesterday your life was
in danger, so I have to ask.

782
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:28,600
What's the relationship between
a common man like you

783
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,440
and the goons of this area?

784
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,440
Son, I wanted to tell
this to you long back.

785
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,320
But I couldn't muster courage.

786
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,840
I used all my savings and
your mother's ornaments

787
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:45,200
to buy land in this village as
you too were working here.

788
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,960
Later I got to know that there
is someone called Tamma Reddy.

789
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,240
They threatened me
to give up that land.

790
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:54,640
They threatened me but
I was dumbfounded.

791
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:59,840
I got all the documents from the
seller and lodged a case in court.

792
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:04,480
The lawyer told me that the opposite
party is very powerful.

793
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,440
And we would require a lot
of money to win the case.

794
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:11,760
So I took a loan from everyone
in the village.

795
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,720
We won the case recently.

796
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:18,280
I was on my way to Kuppam
to inform you about this.

797
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:21,720
But in the meantime,
they started beating me up.

798
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,440
Why did they take me
to that talkies?

799
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,280
And what were you doing in
that talkies, at that time?

800
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:30,960
When I wonder about it,

801
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,440
it seems like God's miracle.

802
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:37,440
I don't understand why
they are like this.

803
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:43,680
I am sorry, but we don't have
anything better for offerings.

804
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,560
This temple is like this now

805
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:49,160
but once upon a time, this village
and temple were prosperous.

806
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:53,920
Since the arrival of Tamma Reddy,
this village has lost its happiness.

807
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,200
Most family members are found
as photo frames on the walls.

808
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:00,560
People do not even react to
their neighbours' beheading.

809
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,960
If they do,
they will lose their lives.

810
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,680
They don't have a son like yours,

811
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,440
who can go against them
to save his family.

812
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,320
When will he be cured?

813
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,400
The injuries will cure soon,

814
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:27,280
but I am not sure if
his fear will go away.

815
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,440
Don't take me wrong.

816
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:33,160
He will come out of the coma only
when he overcomes that fear.

817
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:40,720
How many men were there?

818
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,440
How many people attacked him?

819
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,480
He was alone, boss.

820
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:47,280
Who was he?

821
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,080
Subramanium.

822
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,760
Subramanium?

823
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,200
What the hell were you doing?

824
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:03,600
Brother, now I will go.

825
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:10,680
I will kill him in your presence or
else I will bring his head to you.

826
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,640
Hey, come along.

827
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,760
Brother. - Huh? - Do you have
a change for 50 rupees.

828
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:29,880
Did you hear the news?
- What is it?

829
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:31,840
Someone has thrashed Sharad
Reddy last night.

830
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,120
Is it true?
- Yes.

831
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,440
Did you hear? Someone thrashed
Reddy so badly last night,

832
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:37,360
that he almost died.

833
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,760
He deserves it.

834
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:39,800
Take the money!

835
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,480
Priest, did you hear this?

836
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:50,520
Someone has thrashed Reddy so bad
that he almost died. - Really?

837
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:53,680
Hail God! - All praise to powerful
Lord Murgan! Harom Hara!

838
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,480
Are you sure about this news?
- Yes, I am sure.

839
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:57,960
This is something to be celebrated.

840
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:59,440
Come on, everybody.

841
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,800
Today I will give peanuts for free.
Come and take it.

842
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:06,560
Take it, sister. - Did you hear that
Sharad Reddy has been thrashed?

843
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:07,480
Is it?
- Yes.

844
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,400
Durga,
Sharad Reddy has been thrashed.

845
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:12,200
Listen. Sharad Reddy has been
thrashed by someone.

846
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:15,400
Daughter, did you hear that Sharad
Reddy has been thrashed by someone?

847
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,360
Is it true?
- Yes, daughter.

848
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:18,320
Take it, sister.

849
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,840
Give it to me.
- Give me some.

850
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,760
I never thought
I would see this day.

851
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,920
I guess good times await us.

852
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,960
Where does he stay?

853
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,080
Where does he stay?

854
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:45,240
Where is that Subramanium
who thrashed my boy?

855
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:50,080
Trust me. I didn't know his name.

856
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:55,240
Now that I have heard the name,
I realise God has come to save us.

857
01:17:55,320 --> 01:18:00,280
I wouldn't say anything even
if I knew his name.

858
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:07,080
Boss!

859
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:54,960
If I kill him,

860
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:59,080
the fear of watching him die would
make someone else speak out.

861
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:00,520
Kill him!

862
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:02,920
"The angel of death is here!"

863
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,160
"Lord Shankar."

864
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:20,480
You were asking about the whereabouts
of Subramanium, weren't you?

865
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:25,320
He is not just Subramanium,
but wrathful Subramanium!

866
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:00,040
If we kill him along with this man

867
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:02,240
we will get rid of the troubles.
- Have you forgotten who I am?

868
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,240
Come on! Kill him!
- Brother, get in.

869
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,400
I will kill you all and bury you.
- Listen to me. Get inside.

870
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:08,360
Get out of here!

871
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,880
Get inside.
- Go back! - Kill him!

872
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:19,920
I know about all the atrocities these
guys carried on in this village.

873
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:23,840
Henceforth nothing of that
sort will take place here.

874
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:30,560
I will get back all your lands
these people grabbed from you.

875
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:34,240
I will also get back all the money
they stole from the temple.

876
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:37,720
Call all those who have migrated
away from this village.

877
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:41,600
Now no father will have to look
forward to his son's arrival.

878
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:44,360
No daughter will cry for her mother.

879
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:47,640
No wife will live without her
husband.

880
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:51,280
The festival that stopped 30 years
ago will start again. I swear.

881
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:57,760
Henceforth if any troubles have
to reach you

882
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:02,280
Subramanium is standing before you,

883
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,600
it must first face me.

884
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:13,040
We have heard
about Tarakasur's story.

885
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:15,200
But today I am witnessing it.

886
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:18,040
He is not any ordinary Subramanium.

887
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:20,720
He is the manifestation
of Lord Murgan,

888
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,960
whom I prayed for all these years.

889
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:24,520
He is Lord Murgan.

890
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:26,760
All hail, Lord Murgan!

891
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:29,440
All hail, Lord Murgan!

892
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:32,600
All hail, Lord Murgan!

893
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,160
Harom Hara!

894
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:38,080
Harom Hara!

895
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,680
You don't have to live in
that village any more.

896
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,720
Don't worry about the money.
Let's go.

897
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:54,520
Yes.
- Thank you.

898
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,200
Brother, it is because of you
that we could meet again.

899
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:21,600
Now that all of you are back,
everything will be fine.

900
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:22,480
Okay, brother.

901
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:23,720
Bye.

902
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:37,280
(Chanting)

903
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:43,320
Brother, I have always seen rage
in your eyes

904
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,240
for the first time I see sadness.

905
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,400
A strong man should never display
his sadness to others.

906
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,800
My son lies in a hospital.

907
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:55,160
My younger brother was killed
in front of the village.

908
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:58,760
And I have exiled myself
from the village after losing.

909
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:02,120
I know who is responsible for it

910
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,480
still I can't do anything to him.

911
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:09,480
You have not lost until you give up,
Tamma Reddy.

912
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:41,320
Listen. Can't you see the water
dripping? Keep the umbrella out.

913
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:42,560
Keep it out, dear.
- Hmm.

914
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:49,880
Tell me. What do you want?

915
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:51,240
Father-in-law, give that.

916
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,200
We won the case in the court.

917
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:59,880
We have the order.
You need to sign these documents.

918
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:01,120
I got it.

919
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:05,440
Do some favours and I will get
your job done in 3 months.

920
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:07,680
Why are you silent?

921
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,280
Didn't you understand what favours
I am talking about?

922
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:11,760
We understood what it meant.

923
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:15,200
If you say 2 to 3 months,
my father-in-law and I would wait.

924
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,840
But my husband won't wait that long.

925
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:21,360
We can't consider his impatience.
He must wait.

926
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:24,160
Your husband is not a king that
things would happen at his pace.

927
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:26,280
Do you know Subramanium?

928
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,360
Why? Do I have to know him?

929
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:30,560
Can you please stand and look there?

930
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:42,560
I swear, I didn't know. Please sit.

931
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,840
Sit. Get some tea for them.

932
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:48,640
We don't require your hospitality.
Just get our job done.

933
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:58,120
Hey, look for that survey number.
Quick.

934
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,800
Hey, get it done fast.

935
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:34,800
Two minutes, brother.
Get the documents ready.

936
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,360
Yes. Give it.

937
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:46,680
Sir!

938
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:55,920
Your papers are ready, sir. I swear.

939
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,320
They have come
for the land documents.

940
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:00,480
The job is done.

941
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,720
Hey! Is your work done?

942
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:05,680
No. Not yet, brother.

943
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,320
They are refusing.
- It's not done.

944
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:09,120
There's no fault of mine.

945
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:11,760
I did it out of Tamma Reddy's fear.

946
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:13,240
Now...

947
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:18,200
The pace with which you got
my documents done

948
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:21,200
with the same pace,
their work must be done.

949
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:22,520
Okay?

950
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:25,040
I will do it, brother.
I will get it done in a month.

951
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:27,640
Grandpa, he is asking for a month.
Is it okay with you?

952
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:30,040
Son, we have been hearing the same
thing since the last 5 years.

953
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:32,640
Look, those times were different.

954
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:33,600
These times are different.

955
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:34,840
I will get it done quickly.

956
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:37,040
Brother, don't worry.

957
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:47,680
Brother,
they have ruined all my lands.

958
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:49,360
What should we do now?

959
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:52,200
My land is barren, brother.

960
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,480
I don't know what to do.

961
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:58,480
Even selling all my land will be
insufficient to clear my loans.

962
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,480
I will take care of everything.
- Okay.

963
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:08,040
Sir, take this. Please take this.

964
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:12,960
Come.
- Yes.

965
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:20,960
Brother, did you notice it?

966
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:23,960
Once upon a time,
my family was very small.

967
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:26,640
Now see how big it has become.

968
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,600
So have my responsibilities!

969
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:32,160
That means,
my income should also grow.

970
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:58,120
Brother Palani,
we have to lease this factory.

971
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:01,520
What? Are you going to increase
your income with bricks?

972
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:06,120
Why are you laughing,
kiddo? Say something.

973
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:09,280
There's nothing to say.
It's time for action.

974
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:30,400
"This life goes on unsteadily."

975
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:35,360
"But you have to run to win
the race."

976
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:40,000
"Those who wake up from slumber,
don't sleep again."

977
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:44,960
"It's true.
You can make your dream come true."

978
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:50,120
"You have to overcome difficulties."

979
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:01,280
Hey, kiddo.

980
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:05,360
We are finding it difficult to name
these models while taking orders.

981
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:06,600
Nobody is literate here.

982
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:10,080
So what? We need a name that
can be easily understood.

983
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:13,200
This is NTR Rao.

984
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:15,440
This is NR Rao.

985
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,120
This is Chiranjeevi.

986
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:19,760
And this is Krishna.

987
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:22,680
And what about this?

988
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:26,440
Amitabh Bachchan.

989
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:28,680
It'll be world famous.

990
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:33,640
"The heart beats fast.
Be careful, dear."

991
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:37,800
"There are hurdles on every path.
You can't rule here."

992
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:43,240
"There are no rules.
Only the brave ones win."

993
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:48,320
"You will have your day as well."

994
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:18,360
"The heart is yours.
I live for you."

995
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:23,320
"No matter how I am,
I will always be with you."

996
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:27,960
"Be it joy or grief,
I won't abandon you."

997
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:29,400
What, brother?
Why are you reading it?

998
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:31,320
You don't need it.

999
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:34,760
If you want to make progress,
you have to learn.

1000
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:37,280
Your progress will stop
if you stop learning.

1001
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:39,880
Kiddo.

1002
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:42,480
They have come for money
to buy seeds.

1003
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:43,440
Devi!

1004
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:52,800
Enough, dear.

1005
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:55,800
Eat it, father-in-law.
I have made your favourite dish.

1006
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:57,200
Okay.

1007
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:01,000
Dad, do only fathers know
their kids' likes and dislikes.

1008
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,560
Children too know
their fathers' likes and dislikes.

1009
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:10,320
Eat it.
- Eat it.

1010
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,880
Kiddo, we have received this letter
from a Don of Mumbai.

1011
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:29,680
Is he going on a war?

1012
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:31,320
We can't build such a big weapon.

1013
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,000
Are you planning to build it?

1014
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:38,880
No, brother.

1015
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,120
I was thinking once brother makes
it, what name should it be given.

1016
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:44,640
What name have you thought of?
- Jyoti Lakshmi.

1017
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:48,320
Jyoti Lakshmi?
- Yes.

1018
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:51,600
Have a look at it.
- He says to name it Jyoti Lakshmi.

1019
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:57,320
"Now our time will start.
Walk graciously."

1020
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:01,680
"The destination is not far."

1021
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:06,760
"Fulfill your dream with fortitude."

1022
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:11,800
"Don't let anything stop you,
at any cost."

1023
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:12,760
Take care.

1024
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:15,000
Not of yourself,
take care of the gun.

1025
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:04,440
Local made. - I have seen many
such bullets in Mumbai, madam.

1026
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:07,320
Can't locally made goods
reach Bombay?

1027
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:10,360
What should we do now, madam?

1028
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:13,440
The man behind the trigger would
be apprehended somehow.

1029
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:16,400
But I want the man
who made the trigger.

1030
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:30,560
Tell me, Selva Manik.
What brings you here?

1031
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:34,200
He taught me to shoot since
I have been in this business.

1032
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:37,760
His name is Mahendra.
He reins even in big cities.

1033
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:39,960
You have brought so many men,

1034
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:42,760
then the job must be big enough.
What is it?

1035
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:44,160
Look, brother.

1036
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:46,760
Until yesterday,
my gang was unbeatable.

1037
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:49,600
But today I have been betrayed by
my step-brother.

1038
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:51,880
Many of
my gang members have been killed.

1039
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:54,480
I won't spare him.
- He can't hide.

1040
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:56,880
We have to break down his strength.

1041
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:59,440
That means,
we need to kill Subramanium.

1042
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,480
And I want your help to do that.

1043
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:06,400
He was once our Sharad's friend
and has started a gang of his own.

1044
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:09,840
Didn't you tell me that he has good
relationships with those people?

1045
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:12,000
Then why do you need us?

1046
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:16,240
But if we do this,
my boss's importance will dwindle.

1047
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:17,920
That's why we have approached you.

1048
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:21,320
Okay. Tell me,
what can I do for you?

1049
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:25,400
Subramanium will recognize any
gangster from our three states.

1050
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:27,920
Someone not related
to our field must approach him

1051
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,720
and give him a big consignment order

1052
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:31,520
and call him in our area.

1053
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:35,720
Once he comes, he will not return.
He will be sent to hell!

1054
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:41,360
So, instead of us, we should send
someone with political connection.

1055
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:42,360
That's our plan.

1056
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:48,720
Brother, MLA Venkateshwar is coming.

1057
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:03,000
It's a very small matter,
Subramanium. You don't have to fear.

1058
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:07,560
Do you see fear in my eyes?

1059
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:12,120
Tell me.

1060
01:39:12,440 --> 01:39:14,360
Do you know Nataraj
from Krishnagiri?

1061
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:16,480
Elections will be held there.

1062
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:19,760
The opposition candidate
is expanding his gang.

1063
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:24,920
We need guns for their safety,
that's why I have come to you.

1064
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:28,720
That's fine.
But who told you that we sell guns?

1065
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:33,040
Being in politics,
can't I find out this information?

1066
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:37,680
Just let me know if you can do
the job or not.

1067
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:40,040
There is nothing we can't do.

1068
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,200
When do you want
the delivery and where?

1069
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:44,360
Take a look.

1070
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:46,840
The front one is NTR,

1071
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:50,840
the one beside that is Chiranjeevi
and that one is Krishna.

1072
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:54,520
Tell me what you want
and when you want.

1073
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:56,520
Krishna. A tractor full.

1074
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:58,520
You have
to deliver it to Krishnagiri.

1075
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:04,640
Your job will be done.
Pay advance to my men.

1076
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:13,840
If you go back on your promise,
you will lose your life.

1077
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:16,920
My deal with me is like
a deal with God.

1078
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:23,000
Your job will be done.
You may leave.

1079
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:45,800
Where's the tractor?

1080
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:52,920
I have counted the money, kiddo.

1081
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:33,440
Subramanium,
you considered yourself a lion,

1082
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,120
when this lion was missing.

1083
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:37,480
My one hand is enough for you.

1084
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:39,440
To kill you,

1085
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,720
this lion will take you along.

1086
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:10,280
"It's time to annihilate
the enemies."

1087
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:11,600
Jyoti Lakshmi!

1088
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:15,160
"It's time."

1089
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:22,800
"It's time to annihilate
the enemies."

1090
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:26,800
"Harom Hara."

1091
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:51,640
"It's an extraordinary sight."

1092
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:56,200
Oh no! What is that, brother?

1093
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:00,840
It Subramanium's wrathful avatar.

1094
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:07,120
"He has come as the angel of death."

1095
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:09,840
"To punish you."

1096
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:13,880
In a forest without lions,
even a wolf believes it's a lion.

1097
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:17,760
Once your raise your head,
you will know who the lion is.

1098
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:22,720
Do you know who I am?

1099
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:25,840
Subramanium!

1100
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:28,960
God of war.

1101
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:50,600
Shall I tell you something?

1102
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:55,480
I know that you are doing business
not just for our family

1103
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:57,400
but for the people.

1104
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:00,240
I felt like telling this
to you in front of God.

1105
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:02,880
Son, the weapons that you create

1106
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:05,120
I don't know if they
any good or bad.

1107
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:07,840
But those weapons only shed blood.

1108
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:10,520
If your weapons take innocent lives,

1109
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:12,920
we will be burdened with those sins.

1110
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:18,920
On the coming festival,
take a vow to quit this.

1111
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,280
Will you listen to me, son?

1112
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:27,920
Okay, dad.

1113
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:29,160
Let's go.

1114
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:31,640
Son, don't worry at all.

1115
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:34,240
If you want to do something
for these people

1116
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:39,320
find some another noble way,
which is in everyone's well-being.

1117
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:50,360
There is a man named Subramanium
in Kuppam.

1118
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,440
Did you come here to say this?

1119
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:55,920
I also made a mistake
of underestimating him.

1120
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:59,160
But he is more powerful
than a hundred of men.

1121
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:01,080
We will see.

1122
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:04,320
Idiot. We couldn't harm him
when he was out in the open.

1123
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:05,800
He will blow us
to pieces in his area.

1124
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:08,280
He thinks he is arms Lord by
manufacturing a few weapons.

1125
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:10,320
Do you know what I will do now?

1126
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,320
What?

1127
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:18,960
Be it Kuppam or anywhere else,
he will die for sure.

1128
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:22,880
But we have another problem.
Kiranmay.

1129
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,600
Chidambaram, SHO.

1130
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:35,160
He is our writer Shreenu!

1131
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:36,600
Where's the evidence?

1132
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:38,280
They are inside, madam
- Come.

1133
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:47,040
This is from Madanapalli and
this is from Krishnagiri.

1134
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:49,960
This is from Mullubangan and
this is from Kolar.

1135
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:55,640
All of them have the same model
of guns and bullets.

1136
01:45:56,720 --> 01:46:00,440
So, manufacturers
and suppliers are the same?

1137
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:02,240
But who is supplying so much, madam?

1138
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:04,200
From our primary investigation

1139
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:06,120
we have received information that

1140
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:08,480
they are supplied
from the Kuppam borders.

1141
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:12,200
But who can do this in Kuppam,
madam?

1142
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:14,120
Chidambaram, there is

1143
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:17,880
a small town called Bulandshaher,
in Uttar Pradesh.

1144
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:21,880
Illegal guns were supplied
in India from there.

1145
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:25,240
Just like you said,
if police too would have thought

1146
01:46:25,320 --> 01:46:26,800
who could do it from here

1147
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,640
then that crime would have
never been exposed.

1148
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:32,800
Condemnation without investigation
is the height of ignorance.

1149
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:37,480
So, keep aside your intelligence
and search properly in Kuppam.

1150
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:39,400
And secure all the borders
in the vicinity.

1151
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:43,160
No vehicle should be allowed outside
without proper checking.

1152
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:44,400
Yes, madam.

1153
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:07,800
(Chanting)

1154
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:11,880
(Chanting)

1155
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:17,600
(Chanting)

1156
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:42,400
Hail Lord Murgan!
- Harom Hara!

1157
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:53,400
(Chanting)

1158
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:58,600
(Chanting)

1159
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:03,800
(Chanting)

1160
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:07,640
(Chanting)

1161
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:08,520
Sir.

1162
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:32,360
Brother Palani! Brother Palani!

1163
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:34,800
Brother.

1164
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:39,160
Hey! Why did you come here instead
of taking

1165
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:40,160
the vehicle to the factory?

1166
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:41,640
Brother, we have a huge problem.

1167
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,920
On the way, the police stopped
and started checking the vehicle.

1168
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:51,040
Did you check well?

1169
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:52,120
They did, madam. They found nothing.

1170
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:53,600
This is
a regular plying vehicle here.

1171
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:54,880
Where are you coming from?

1172
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:56,840
I am coming from
a neighbouring village, ma'am.

1173
01:49:11,320 --> 01:49:13,560
They found that the lorry belongs
to Subramanium. What do we do now?

1174
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:16,480
Okay, go to the factory immediately.
I will take care of it. - Okay.

1175
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:17,640
9mm bullet.

1176
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:18,800
I didn't get it, madam.

1177
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:20,840
Look, Chidambaram.

1178
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:24,400
Kuppam has flower gardens,
so they can be transported.

1179
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:27,720
There's is a quarry here,
so it can be exported.

1180
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:30,200
But why are bricks getting exported?

1181
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:32,880
They will get many from Karnataka
and Tamil Nadu.

1182
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:34,280
Instead of getting from there,

1183
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:35,840
why would they export
from this village?

1184
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:37,560
Maybe their quality is good, madam.

1185
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:40,800
Why would someone spend
such a big amount on quality?

1186
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:43,320
It's bloody common sense, darn it!

1187
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:57,760
Go in and get all the guns out.
- Okay.

1188
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:12,280
Listen. Take different routes
and reach the desert.

1189
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:18,920
It is from Bombay.

1190
01:50:19,480 --> 01:50:21,440
Since we are tracking trunk calls,

1191
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:24,160
he is been doing
his business through letters.

1192
01:50:24,240 --> 01:50:25,440
Start the vehicle.

1193
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:28,760
Madam. - We must not lose
Subramanium at any cost.

1194
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:31,040
Send a team to search the factory.
- Okay, madam.

1195
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:34,760
Mohan, reach the factory
for searching with your team.

1196
01:51:04,680 --> 01:51:09,960
(Chanting)

1197
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:33,920
Chidambaram,
go inside and search the place.

1198
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:38,440
Hey, search the whole house.
Don't miss any corner.

1199
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:40,120
Son.

1200
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:17,920
We didn't get anything
at the factory, madam.

1201
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:29,720
Madam, we have found nothing.

1202
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:44,640
Chidambaram,
frisk everyone present here.

1203
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:48,760
You both go that side, you both
come here. Don't spare anyone.

1204
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:54,640
Stand in line.

1205
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:36,960
Subramanium, don't do anything.

1206
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:46,960
Give me the cuffs.

1207
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:54,160
Hey, you can't arrest our brother.

1208
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:02,240
Hey!
Police are arresting Subramanium.

1209
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:05,960
They are arresting our brother!
We have to stop them. Come on.

1210
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:35,960
Son!

1211
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:37,880
You can't come. Stay right there.

1212
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:39,080
Hurry up!

1213
01:55:04,160 --> 01:55:05,720
Chidambaram, what's happening now?

1214
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:10,280
Madam, I guess we can't move the
vehicle even an inch from here.

1215
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:21,240
Ma'am, they won't listen unless
Subramanium asks them.

1216
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:26,520
Subramanium, you would be
responsible for any bloodbath here.

1217
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:27,760
Think about it.

1218
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:49,760
Enough of theatrics. Get up now.

1219
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:54,920
Look. You are my family.

1220
01:55:56,120 --> 01:55:58,960
What respect will I have if
my family is lying on the roads?

1221
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:02,480
Listen to your Subramanium, get up.

1222
01:56:05,360 --> 01:56:09,160
Do not cause any ruckus. Do not stop
the festivities we started.

1223
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:11,560
They can't do anything.

1224
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:16,000
They are not arresting me. I am
going with them as per my will.

1225
01:56:23,720 --> 01:56:26,040
Subramanium should be released!
- Yes!

1226
01:56:26,120 --> 01:56:29,680
Yes! Release him!

1227
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:36,480
If this continues like this,
how will we take him to court?

1228
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:53,440
Hey! They have taken brother
Subramanium this way.

1229
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:54,920
He is not inside.

1230
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:03,080
Hey! Your hero is not here.

1231
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:04,600
As per the court's warrant,

1232
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:07,040
we have shifted him
to a different station.

1233
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:11,040
Everyone leave from here.

1234
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:32,600
Now,
for the festival to be celebrated

1235
01:57:32,680 --> 01:57:34,560
and the people's life to be saved

1236
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:37,800
find out where Subramanium is.

1237
01:57:38,120 --> 01:57:43,160
So you think that I have relocated
your Subramanium from here.

1238
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:48,080
But I believe that you have
influenced and taken him from here.

1239
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:51,120
You know what happened
when we arrested him.

1240
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:04,480
Protection warrant.

1241
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:08,200
With your cooperation, we have
to take Subramanium to Chittoor.

1242
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:13,720
You may have arrested him

1243
01:58:14,160 --> 01:58:17,640
but if someone has taken Subramanium
from your custody,

1244
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:20,360
then it's a part of a very big plan.

1245
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:22,040
Please, madam.

1246
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:25,120
Please find our Subramanium
at any cost.

1247
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:26,880
I beg of you.

1248
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:49,600
Hello.
- Sir, what's happening here?

1249
01:58:49,680 --> 01:58:52,040
Did you intentionally make me
do all this?

1250
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:55,800
If this is the case, the situation
is going to be chaotic.

1251
01:58:55,880 --> 01:58:58,360
Let it be, Kiranmay.
Things will go accordingly.

1252
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:05,320
Give me the information now. Yeah.

1253
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:20,560
Thanks, madam.

1254
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:30,760
Rajamanikyam, it's me.
Listen to me carefully.

1255
01:59:31,160 --> 01:59:31,960
Yes. Tell me, brother.

1256
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:34,080
Subramanium has been arrested.

1257
01:59:36,680 --> 01:59:38,880
Hello, Manju.
- What happened?

1258
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:40,080
Get to work.

1259
01:59:43,400 --> 01:59:45,640
Brother, there is an emergency!

1260
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:48,880
Arun, I am Palani speaking.

1261
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:53,960
We found the location of the lion's
cage. It's time to hunt.

1262
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:55,040
I will start.

1263
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:10,880
Hello!

1264
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:13,000
Sir, I am ASI Shekhar speaking.

1265
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:16,520
Sir, as we thought, Subramanium
is not any petty criminal.

1266
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:18,680
All the families
of the policemen who arrested him,

1267
02:00:18,760 --> 02:00:19,560
are in their control.

1268
02:00:19,640 --> 02:00:22,720
Gangsters from all the big states
are involved in this.

1269
02:00:22,840 --> 02:00:25,920
Even the home minister's family
has been abducted.

1270
02:00:27,880 --> 02:00:29,360
Hey, stop it!

1271
02:00:33,080 --> 02:00:36,800
Release him immediately.
- What happened, sir?

1272
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:48,720
Take care of what more they want.

1273
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:54,240
Hello.
- Sir, I am SP speaking.

1274
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:58,200
I don't think you know well
about this Subramanium, sir.

1275
02:01:58,280 --> 02:02:00,080
What are you talking about?

1276
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:02,920
Do what the minister has asked you
to do.

1277
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:07,600
Break his limbs and
then hand him over to me.

1278
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:11,880
Sir, if I disobey you,
the maximum I will lose is my job.

1279
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:16,120
He has abducted families of all the
people involved in this operation.

1280
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:19,000
Including the family of that
minister you are talking about.

1281
02:02:19,200 --> 02:02:23,120
Sir, I want to say something
for your own good.

1282
02:02:23,200 --> 02:02:24,960
Hide as soon as possible, sir.

1283
02:02:25,080 --> 02:02:27,200
Hey, what are you talking about?

1284
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:29,160
I am asking you to live.

1285
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:33,880
Singaru!
- Brother.

1286
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:37,040
Ask everyone to get ready.
We won't spare him.

1287
02:02:37,120 --> 02:02:38,040
Okay, brother.

1288
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:50,360
(Chanting)

1289
02:02:50,440 --> 02:02:57,000
(Chanting)

1290
02:02:57,280 --> 02:03:01,720
(Chanting)

1291
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:06,920
(Chanting)

1292
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:10,080
The ritual has started
with Subramanium chants.

1293
02:03:19,640 --> 02:03:21,920
All hail, Lord Murgan! Harom Hara!

1294
02:03:22,040 --> 02:03:24,280
All hail, Lord Murgan! Harom Hara!

1295
02:03:24,360 --> 02:03:26,960
All hail, Lord Murgan! Harom Hara!

1296
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:29,600
All hail, Lord Murgan! Harom Hara!

1297
02:03:29,680 --> 02:03:32,520
All hail, Lord Murgan! Harom Hara!

1298
02:03:58,720 --> 02:03:59,640
Hey!

1299
02:06:12,120 --> 02:06:13,280
This is...

1300
02:06:31,800 --> 02:06:35,600
Dad, I am here.
Let's go to the hospital.

1301
02:06:57,680 --> 02:07:00,480
My son...
- Dad.

1302
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:03,320
I made a mistake.

1303
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:10,080
I thought weapons are used
to kill the innocent people.

1304
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:14,880
If I had a gun,

1305
02:07:15,560 --> 02:07:19,200
I could have saved many lives here.
- Yes, dad.

1306
02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:22,840
You are right.
- If the strong require a weapon

1307
02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:26,920
then it serves as strength
for the weak.

1308
02:07:28,600 --> 02:07:30,360
Son, you should not

1309
02:07:31,160 --> 02:07:32,480
stop your work.

1310
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:34,040
Okay, dad.

1311
02:07:34,360 --> 02:07:35,480
Don't stop it.

1312
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:37,240
I will do that, dad.

1313
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:30,600
"Your blood challenges."

1314
02:09:30,680 --> 02:09:36,400
"Show them your rage."

1315
02:09:36,480 --> 02:09:39,960
"Your blood challenges."

1316
02:09:40,080 --> 02:09:41,280
Hey, Subramanium.

1317
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:42,400
What are you doing?

1318
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:44,920
Where are you planning to go alone?

1319
02:09:45,120 --> 02:09:46,760
You can't go alone.

1320
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:48,200
I will come along with you.

1321
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:50,760
I have lost enough lives.

1322
02:09:51,280 --> 02:09:54,560
Nobody should lose their life
for me in this village,.

1323
02:09:54,640 --> 02:09:56,440
I can't live with that.

1324
02:10:03,920 --> 02:10:07,240
Listen. Are you planning
to wage a war with this?

1325
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:11,360
I won't say anything.

1326
02:10:13,080 --> 02:10:14,080
It's time for action.

1327
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:25,560
Rajendra, he abducted Sharad

1328
02:10:25,640 --> 02:10:28,280
from the hospital and challenged us
to a war.

1329
02:11:31,720 --> 02:11:33,120
Hey!

1330
02:11:35,480 --> 02:11:37,280
Hey! Shoot him down.

1331
02:11:47,200 --> 02:11:50,720
Stop it. Stop it!
He is out of the range.

1332
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:52,960
Hey! Move closer and shoot him down.

1333
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:16,640
Hey, shoot him.

1334
02:13:32,600 --> 02:13:35,280
Lie down, everyone. Lie down!

1335
02:14:17,080 --> 02:14:18,600
Hey! You, go.

1336
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:23,080
Boss,
he has buried something underneath.

1337
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:33,760
Come.

1338
02:14:36,680 --> 02:14:37,880
Where is brother?

1339
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,960
Your husband is there.

1340
02:14:59,880 --> 02:15:02,200
Devi! No!

1341
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:48,280
Come here.

1342
02:15:49,400 --> 02:15:50,200
Come here.

1343
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:56,640
You will be okay.

1344
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:16,600
Go from here.

1345
02:16:50,680 --> 02:16:56,320
"It's the start of destruction."

1346
02:16:56,800 --> 02:17:03,480
"It's time to end evil."

1347
02:18:56,560 --> 02:18:59,600
What harm did my father do to you?

1348
02:19:00,320 --> 02:19:01,960
What harm did
those people do to you?
